ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION
Our Corporate History and Background
The Company was formed on June 21, 2016 under the name “YayYo, LLC,” which was converted into a Delaware corporation pursuant to the unanimous written consent of our former manager and members in a transaction intended to be tax-free under the Internal Revenue Code (the “Conversion”). All of YayYo, LLC’s liabilities and assets, including its intellectual property, were automatically transferred to the Company and the Company has assumed ownership of such assets and liabilities. The Company now operates as a “C” corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware. On September 11, 2020, YayYo, Inc. changed its name to Rideshare Rental, Inc. On March 1, 2021, the Company changed its name from Rideshare Rental, Inc. to EVmo, Inc.
The Company is a holding company operating through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Distinct Cars, LLC and Rideshare Car Rentals, LLC.
The Company’s operating business divisions include (i) an online rideshare vehicle booking platform to service the ridesharing economy through Rideshare Car Rentals, i.e. the Rideshare Platform, and (ii) the maintenance of a fleet of standard passenger vehicles to be made commercially available for rent through Distinct Cars, i.e. Fleet Management. The Company seeks to become the leading provider of a standard rental vehicles to drivers in the ridesharing economy.
On March 16, 2018, we completed an offering under Regulation A+ of the Securities Act, which was qualified by the SEC on March 15, 2017. We sold a total of 365,306 shares of Common Stock. We received cash proceeds of $1.8 million, net of commissions and other costs associated with the gross offering proceeds or payable by us.
On November 15, 2019, the Company closed its initial public offering of 2,625,000 common shares at $4.00 per share, for gross proceeds, before underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses, of $10.5 million, and the shares became listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “YAYO.”
On February 10, 2020, the Company notified Nasdaq of its intent to voluntarily delist its Common Stock from Nasdaq. In connection therewith, the Company notified Nasdaq of the Company’s intention to file a Form 25 with the SEC on or about February 20, 2020. The Company elected to effect the voluntary delisting of its Common Stock after discussions with Nasdaq’s staff, and based on the determination of the Company’s board of directors that voluntarily delisting the Common Stock from Nasdaq was in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Following delisting from Nasdaq, the Common Stock now trades on the OTC Markets, still under the trading symbol, “YAYO.”
Impact of COVID-19 on our business
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus surfaced in China, which has and is continuing to spread throughout the world, including the United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern,” and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak as a “pandemic.” The governors of New York, California and several other states, as well as mayors on many cities, ordered their residents to cease traveling to non-essential jobs and to curtail all unnecessary travel, and to stay in their homes as much as possible in the coming weeks, as the nation confronts the escalating coronavirus outbreak, and similar restrictions have been recommended by the federal authorities and authorities in many other states and cities. From the first quarter of 2020 and the initial rapid spread of COVID-19, rideshare companies were negatively impacted. As Americans began to practice social distancing and self-isolation, Uber, Lyft, and other rideshare companies experienced a steep decline in ridership and revenue. As a result, the Company saw a decline in revenue during the first half of 2020, which had a negative impact on our cash flows, but we then saw a positive upward movement in revenue during the second half of 2020. This has continued in the early months of 2021. As of the date of this Report, several vaccinations for COVID-19 have received emergency-use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration and many of the lockdown restrictions imposed by state and local governments, including those of the markets in which we operate, appear to be abating. Still, the pandemic has not yet ended, and there have been multiple waves where infections, hospitalizations, and deaths have sharply increased. The Company therefore cannot predict the ultimate impact that COVID -19 may have on its business this year. If another lockdown, even a partial one, were to occur in any of our markets, the Company could be forced to scale back its operations and its expansion plans, which could ultimately have a significant negative impact on us.
Principles of consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Distinct Cars, LLC and RideShare Car Rentals, LLC. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
Consolidated Results of Operations-Year ended December 31, 2020, Compared to Year ended December 31, 2019.
Total Revenues
Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $7,621,180, an increase of $706,270 or 10.2% compared to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $6,914,910. The increase is principally due to an increase in our rental fleet offset by a decrease in our average weekly rental income levels throughout the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the COVID-19 outbreak. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the average weekly rental income per vehicle placed in service was $308 compared to $335 for the same period in 2019. Our revenues declined in March and April due to COVID -19 and began to recover in May and June 2020. Our revenue since June is back to pre-COVID-19 levels, but there is no assurance that this trend will continue.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $5,263,474, an increase of $589,604 or 12.6% compared to cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $4,673,870. The increase is due to higher depreciation expense due to an increase in fleet size and higher repairs and maintenance due to the age of the fleet. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 our cost of revenue was 69.1% and 67.6% of our revenue, respectively. The increase in the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue is due to the decrease in average weekly rental income due to the COVID - 19 outbreak.
Selling and Marketing Expenses
Selling and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $490,403, representing a decrease of $275,038 or 35.9% over the year ended December 31, 2019 of $765,441. The decrease is due to better management of media placements for our advertising and a change in the vendor we used to spearhead our marketing efforts to ridesharing and delivery gig drivers.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $5,288,316, representing an increase of $1,264,395 or 31.4% over the year ended December 31, 2019 of $4,023,921. The increase is principally due to higher payroll costs (including stock option expense of $739,973) as we hired additional personnel for our expanding operations and higher management salaries; and higher occupancy costs.
Loss on the Settlement of Debt
Loss on the settlement of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0 as compared to $252,900 for the same period in 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we settled outstanding debt of $421,500 with 84,300 shares of common stock valued at $674,400.
Total Operating Expenses
Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $5,779,719, representing an increase of $722,957 or 14.3% compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 of $5,055,762. The increase is due to the reasons described above.
Interest Expense, Net
Interest and financing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $265,839 compared to $1,115,499 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in interest and financing cost for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to a decrease in outstanding debt.
Gain on Forgiveness of Debt
Gain on forgiveness of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $184,775 as compared to $0 for the same period in 2019, as, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the entire loan of that amount we received under the Paycheck Protection Program of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act was forgiven.
Net Loss
The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $3,502,077, representing a decrease of $428,144 or 10.9% compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 of $3,930,221. The decrease is due to the reasons described above.
Liquidity, Capital Resources and Plan of Operations
On November 15, 2019, we completed our initial public offering of Common Stock, after our registration statement on Form S-1 under the Securities Act was declared effective by the SEC on November 13, 2019. We sold a total of 2,625,000 common shares at a price of $4.00 per share. Total gross proceeds from the offering were $10,500,000, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold an aggregate of 2,553,571 shares of Common Stock to three investors for cash proceeds of $275,000, of which 125,000 shares was sold to a member of our Board of Directors for cash consideration of $25,000.
On January 8, 2021, we received $500,000 from a convertible note from one of our stockholders. The note is convertible into shares of Common Stock at $0.50 per share. The note was converted into 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock in February 2021.
Current Assets, Liabilities and Working Capital
At December 31, 2020, the Company’s current assets totaled $215,990, current liabilities totaled $4,461,560, and working capital was a deficit of $4,245,570. At December 31, 2019, the Company’s current assets totaled $2,098,660, current liabilities totaled $2,655,055, and working capital was a deficit of $556,395.
Regarding current liabilities, the amounts categorized as accounts payable and accrued expenses totaled $2,119,003 and $951,231 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $1,167,772 or 123%.
Since inception, our principal sources of operating funds have been proceeds from equity financing including the sale of our Common Stock to initial investors known to management and principal shareholders of the Company. We do not expect that our current cash on hand will fund our existing operations and future business growth. We will need to raise additional capital in order execute our business plan and growth goals for at least the next twelve-month period thereafter. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient additional funds, it will have to execute a slower than planned growth path, reduce overhead and scale back its business plan until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operational expansion and growth. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $72,890 in cash. The Company generated $536,723 of cash for operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company is seeking to raise additional capital. If the Company is not successful in raising additional capital it will be forced to significantly scale back its business operations and it growth plans. In addition, the COVID-19 virus and the related impact it is having on the U.S. economy is currently having a negative impact on the cash flows of our business. However, we were able to obtain two loans totaling $342,675 related to new legislation passed as a result of COVID-19, of which $184,775 was forgiven in 2020.
Capital Expenditures
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had capital expenditures of $3,705,417 in leased vehicles. At December 31, 2020, most of the Company’s vehicles were finance with leases. At December 31, 2020 the Company had $9,067,885 of rental vehicles, net of accumulated depreciation in the amount of $2,871,452, totaling $6,196,433 in net rental vehicles. At December 31, 2019 the Company had $6,284,211 of rental vehicles, net of accumulated depreciation in the amount of $1,547,164, totaling $4,737,047 in net rental vehicles. The Company’s rental vehicles are depreciated over their estimated useful life of five years. The lease terms for those rental vehicles that are leased are generally for one to three years and the Company has the right to purchase the leased vehicle at the end of the lease terms.
Statement of Cash Flows
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash generated by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $536,723, which was an increase of $3,952,946 from the net cash expended in operating activities of $3,416,223 for the same period in 2019. The increase is principally due to the change in prepaid expenses, other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and non-cash expense items.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash expended in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $1,720,262, which was a change of $6,504,550 from the net cash generated by financing activities of $4,784,288 for the same period in 2019. The change is principally due to the IPO proceeds received in 2019, increase in payments on financing lease obligations in 2020 and repayments of notes payable in 2019.
Current Plan of Operations
Our plan of operations is currently focused on the growth and ongoing development of our operating businesses: (i) the Rideshare Platform, offered through Rideshare, and (ii) Fleet Management, made commercially available through Distinct Cars. We expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future for the enhanced operations of our businesses and related, ongoing, internal research and development. Moreover, we have embarked on “EV strategy” in which we intend to replace our entire fleet of vehicles with all electric vehicles within a relatively short period of time. At this time, we cannot reliably estimate the nature, timing or aggregate amount of all of the costs associated with these.
The continuation of our current plan of operations may require us to raise significant additional capital within a short period of time. If we are successful in raising capital, we believe that the Company will have sufficient cash resources to fund its plan of operations. The cash flow from our Rideshare Platform and, especially, Fleet Management businesses and our existing capital resources are sufficient for us to continue our current operations, but for us to fully execute our business plan we will likely require significant additional capital.
We continually evaluate our plan of operations discussed above to determine the manner in which we can most effectively utilize our limited cash resources. The timing of completion of any aspect of our plan of operations is highly dependent upon the availability of cash to implement that aspect of the plan and other factors beyond our control. There is no assurance that we will successfully obtain the required capital or revenues, or, if obtained, that the amounts will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations. The inability to secure additional capital would have a material adverse effect on us, including the possibility that we would have to sell or forego a portion or all of our assets or cease operations. If we discontinue our operations, we will not have sufficient funds to pay any amounts to our stockholders.
Even if we raise additional capital in the near future, if our operating businesses fail to achieve anticipated financial results, our ability to raise additional capital in the future to fund our operations would likely be seriously impaired. If in the future we are not able to demonstrate favorable financial results or projections from our operating businesses, we will not be able to raise the capital we need to continue our then current business operations and business activities, and we will likely not have sufficient liquidity or cash resources to continue operating.
Because our working capital requirements depend upon numerous factors there can be no assurance that our current cash resources will be sufficient to fund our operations. At present, we have no committed external sources of capital, and do not expect any significant product revenues for the foreseeable future. Thus, we will require immediate additional financing to fund future operations. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to obtain funds on acceptable terms, if at all.
Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies
The Company has entered into a series of monthly vehicle leasing agreements with ACME Auto Leasing and LMP Financial Services, each with an approximate lease term of 12 to 36 months. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had total lease obligations in the amount of $2,352,878 and $2,400,565, respectively. The Company owes monthly payments under each Lease Agreement ranging from approximately $285 per month to $621 per month. At the end of the term of the Lease Agreement, lessee has the right to purchase ownership and title of the subject vehicle for a nominal payment. In addition, the Lease Agreements are subject to and secured by a grant of a purchase money security interest on each leased vehicle.
We lease and maintain our principal offices at 433 North Camden Drive, Suite 600, Beverly Hills, California 90210. We also lease and maintain other offices at 195 South Robertson Drive, Beverly Hills, CA 90210, where the majority of our operational staff conducts its activities on a day-to-day basis. We do not currently own any real estate.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
In the ordinary course of our business, we are not exposed to market risk of the sort that may arise from changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates, or that may otherwise arise from transactions in derivatives.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. Preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. In many instances, we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. This applies in particular to useful lives of non-current assets and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving our judgments and estimates.
Equipment and Rental Vehicles
Equipment and Rental Vehicles are stated at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings as incurred; additions, renewals and betterments are capitalized. When equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Depreciation of equipment and rental vehicles is provided using the straight-line method for substantially all assets with estimated lives as follows:
The Company has not changed its estimate for the useful lives of its equipment and rental vehicles, but would expect that a decrease in the estimated useful lives of equipment and rental vehicles of one year would result in an annual increase to depreciation expense of approximately $450,000, and an increase in the estimated useful lives of equipment and rental vehicles of one year would result in an annual decrease to depreciation expense of approximately $300,000.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. ASC 740 requires a company to use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The Company has not changed it methodology for estimating the valuation allowance. A change in valuation allowance affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made and could be significant due to the large valuation allowance currently established.
Under ASC 740, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. The adoption had no effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue from renting its fleet of cars to ridesharing and delivery gig drivers. Revenue is recognized based on the rental agreements which are generally on a weekly basis. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers.
We consider a signed contract or other similar documentation reflecting the terms and conditions under which products will be provided to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement. Collectability is assessed based on a number of factors, including payment history and the creditworthiness of a customer. If it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured, revenue is not recognized until collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. FASB ASC Topic 718 requires companies to measure compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation at fair value at the grant date and recognize the expense over the employee’s requisite service period. The Company recognizes in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees and non-employees.
Contingencies
Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company’s management, in consultation with its legal counsel as appropriate, assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company, in consultation with legal counsel, evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims, as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable, but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss, if determinable and material, would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.
