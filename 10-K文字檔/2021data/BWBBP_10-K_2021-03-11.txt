Overview
The Company is a financial holding company headquartered in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, which is currently celebrating fifteen years of successful operations. The principal sources of funds for loans and investments are transaction, savings, time, and other deposits, and short-term and long-term borrowings. The Company’s principal sources of income are interest and fees collected on loans, interest and dividends earned on investment securities and service charges. The Company’s principal expenses are interest paid on deposit accounts and borrowings, employee compensation and other overhead expenses. The Company’s simple, efficient business model of providing responsive support and unconventional experiences to clients continues to be the underlying principle that drives the Company’s profitable growth.
During the third quarter of 2020, the Company opened its newly constructed office complex in St. Louis Park, Minnesota. The Company relocated its headquarters from Bloomington, Minnesota and relocated its current branch location in St. Louis Park to the new office complex.
Information Regarding COVID-19 Impact
Financial Position and Results of Operations. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, has continued to create uncertainty and extraordinary change for the Company, its clients, its communities and the country as a whole. In response to this pandemic, the Company rapidly deployed its business continuity plan and continues to take steps to protect the health and safety of its employees and clients. Given the fluidity of the situation, management cannot estimate the duration and full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy, financial markets and the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
Effects on the Company’s Market Area. The Company’s primary banking market area is the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, MN-WI Metropolitan Statistical Area. Throughout 2020, Minnesota’s Governor issued a number of restrictions impacting business and gatherings within the state. The Company’s branch operations continue to operate in compliance with fluid statewide mandates, maintaining the safety of employees and clients as the utmost priority, all while attempting to ensure clients’ diverse banking needs are met.
Policy and Regulatory Developments. Federal, state and local governments and regulatory authorities have enacted and issued a range of policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the following:
● The Federal Reserve decreased the range for the Federal Funds Target Rate by 0.50% on March 3, 2020, and by another 1.00% on March 16, 2020, reaching a current range of 0.00 - 0.25%.
● On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, which established a $2.0 trillion economic stimulus package, including cash payments to individuals, supplemental unemployment insurance benefits and a $349 billion loan program administered through the U.S. Small Business Administration, or SBA, referred to as the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. On April 24, 2020, an additional $310 billion in funding for PPP loans was authorized, with such funds available for PPP loans beginning on April 27, 2020. In addition, the CARES Act, as extended by the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021 (a part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021), provides financial institutions the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under GAAP related to troubled debt restructurings, or TDRs, for a limited period of time to account for the effects of COVID-19. The Company is applying this guidance to qualifying loan modifications.
● On April 7, 2020, federal banking regulators issued a revised Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions, which, among other things, encouraged financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of COVID-19, and stated that institutions generally do not need to categorize COVID-19 related modifications as TDRs and that the agencies will not direct supervised institutions to automatically categorize all COVID-19 related loan modifications as TDRs.
● On April 9, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced additional measures aimed at supporting small and midsized businesses, as well as state and local governments impacted by COVID-19. The Federal Reserve announced the Main Street Lending Program, which established two new loan facilities intended to facilitate lending to small and midsized businesses: (1) the Main Street New Loan Facility, or MSNLF, and (2) the Main Street Expanded Loan Facility, or MSELF. MSNLF loans are unsecured term loans originated on or after April 8, 2020, while MSELF loans are provided as upsized tranches of existing loans originated before April 8, 2020. The combined size of the program is $600 billion. The Federal Reserve also stated that it would provide additional funding to banks offering PPP loans to struggling small businesses, through the PPP Liquidity Facility. Lenders participating in the PPP will be able to exclude loans pledged to the facility from their leverage ratio.
● On August 3, 2020, the FFIEC issued a joint statement on Additional Loan Accommodations Related to COVID-19, which, among other things, encouraged financial institutions to consider prudent additional loan accommodation options when borrowers are unable to meet their obligations due to continuing financial challenges. Accommodation options should be based on prudent risk management and consumer protection principles.
● On December 27, 2020, President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, a $900.0 billion COVID-19 relief package that includes an additional $284.0 billion in PPP funding.
● In addition to the policy responses described above, the federal bank regulatory agencies, along with their state counterparts, have issued a stream of guidance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and have taken a number of unprecedented steps to help banks navigate the pandemic and mitigate its impact. These include, without limitation: requiring banks to focus on business continuity and pandemic planning; adding pandemic scenarios to stress testing; encouraging bank use of capital buffers and reserves in lending programs; permitting certain regulatory reporting extensions; reducing margin requirements on swaps; permitting certain otherwise prohibited investments in investment funds; issuing guidance to encourage banks to work with customers affected by the pandemic and encourage loan workouts; and providing credit under the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, for certain pandemic-related loans, investments and public service. Moreover, because of the need for social distancing measures, the agencies revamped the manner in which they conducted periodic examinations of their regulated institutions, including making greater use of off-site reviews. The Federal Reserve also issued guidance encouraging banking institutions to utilize its discount window for loans and intraday credit extended by its Reserve Banks to help households and businesses impacted by the pandemic and announced numerous funding facilities. The FDIC has also acted to mitigate the deposit insurance assessment effects of participating in the PPP and the Federal Reserve’s PPP Liquidity Facility and Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility.
Capital and Liquidity. At December 31, 2020, the Company and Bank’s capital ratios were in excess of all regulatory requirements. The Company maintains access to multiple sources of liquidity.
In addition, the Company issued $50.0 million of 5.25% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due June 2030 in a private placement on June 19, 2020. These notes are callable starting in 2025 and qualify for tier 2 capital treatment at the holding company level. The Company injected $25.0 million of capital into the Bank in connection with the subordinated note issuance, which qualifies for tier 1 capital treatment at the bank level.
Asset Valuation. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the economic turmoil and market volatility
resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic caused a substantial decline in the Company’s stock price and market capitalization. The Company believed such a decline was a triggering event requiring an interim goodwill impairment analysis during the year. The Company performed an interim analysis and determined that goodwill was not more likely than not impaired, resulting in no impairment charge for the period. In the event that all or a portion of goodwill is impaired, a non-cash charge for the amount of such impairment would be recorded to earnings. Such a charge would have no impact on tangible capital or regulatory capital. At December 31, 2020, the Company had goodwill of $2.6 million.
Active Management of Credit Risk. The Company has modified its internal policies to increase oversight and analysis of all credits, especially in vulnerable industries such as hospitality and restaurants to proactively monitor evolving credit risk. The Company has not yet experienced charge-offs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the continued uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the pandemic and related economic effects has and will continue to affect the Company’s estimate of its allowance for loan losses and resulting provision for loan losses. The Company will continue to monitor credits closely while working with clients to provide relief when appropriate.
COVID-19 Related Loan Deferrals and PPP Lending. The Company has developed programs for assisting existing clients through this uncertain time by providing, when appropriate, loan modifications that may include loan payment deferrals, interest-only modifications, or extended amortization. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had active loan modifications for 26 loans totaling $66.6 million. Of that total, loan modifications to interest-only payments totaled $61.1 million, loans with payment deferrals totaled $613,000, and loans with extended amortization periods totaled $4.8 million. In accordance with recent regulatory guidance and the CARES Act, as extended by the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021 (a part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021), loans modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are not considered TDRs.
In a further effort to assist both existing and new clients, the Company participated in government loan programs through the SBA, primarily the PPP. As of December 31, 2020, principal balances originated under the program totaled $181.6 million, $138.5 million of which was outstanding as of December 31, 2020. The Company has generated fees from the SBA, net of costs, of $5.7 million, $2.9 million of which was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company has begun originating additional PPP loans under the most recent COVID-19 relief package signed into law on December 27, 2020. As of March 5, 2021, the Company had originated 416 new PPP loans totaling $56.1 million.
Processes, Controls, and Business Continuity. The Company’s operations are being conducted in material compliance with current federal, state and local government guidelines regarding social distancing, sanitation, and personal hygiene. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company began allowing employees to return to the office in accordance with new health and safety procedures, including increasing physical space between employees, using face coverings, alternating schedules for employees in the workspace and requiring employees with COVID-19 symptoms or exposure to quarantine away from the office. Additional information about the Company’s COVID-19 pandemic assistance programs, including relevant disclosures and up-to-date information, is maintained at bwbmn.com.
The Company’s ongoing investments in technology, digital platforms and electronic banking have allowed clients and employees to transact with minimal interruption during this time of uncertainty. Additional team members have been assigned to assist clients over the telephone and work with clients on new enrollments in online banking and other treasury management services. Internally, these investments in technology have enabled increased communication capabilities for departments by use of video conferencing, chat, and other collaborative features.
The Company believes it is positioned to continue these business continuity measures for the foreseeable future; however, no assurances can be provided as circumstances may change depending on the duration of the pandemic.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared based on the application of certain accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included as a part of this report. Certain policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic
assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variation and may significantly affect the reported results and financial position for the current period or in future periods. The use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded or adjusted to reflect fair value. Assets carried at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on either quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third-party sources, when available. When such information is not available, management estimates valuation adjustments. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on the future financial condition and results of operations. Management has discussed each critical accounting policy and the methodology for the identification and determination of critical accounting policies with the Company’s Audit Committee.
The JOBS Act permits the Company an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards affecting public companies. The Company has elected to take advantage of this extended transition period, which means that the financial statements included in this report, as well as any financial statements filed in the future, will not be subject to all new or revised accounting standards generally applicable to public companies for the transition period for so long as the Company remains an emerging growth company or until the Company affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition period under the JOBS Act.
The following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies and significant estimates that require the Company to make complex and subjective judgements.
Allowance for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses, sometimes referred to as the “allowance,” is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management determines all or a portion of the loan balance to be uncollectible. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for cash received on previously charged-off amounts. If the allowance is considered inadequate to absorb future loan losses on existing loans for any reason, including but not limited to, increases in the size of the loan portfolio, increases in charge-offs or changes in the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, then the provision for loan losses is increased.
A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement. The collection of all amounts due according to original contractual terms means that both the contractual interest and principal payments of a loan will be collected as scheduled in the loan agreement. An impaired loan is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or, as a practical expedient, at the loan’s observable market price, or the fair value of the underlying collateral, reduced by costs to sell on a discounted basis, is used if a loan is collateral dependent.
Investment Securities Impairment
Periodically, the Company may need to assess whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security on which there is an unrealized loss is impaired on an other than temporary basis. In any such instance, the Company would consider many factors, including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, the market liquidity for the security, the financial condition and the near-term prospects of the issuer, expected cash flows, and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to recover the temporary loss. Securities on which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other than temporary are written down to fair value, with the write-down recorded as a realized loss in securities gains (losses).
The fair values of investment securities are generally determined by various pricing models. The Company evaluates the methodologies used to develop the resulting fair values. The Company performs an annual analysis on the pricing of investment securities to ensure that the prices represent reasonable estimates of fair value. The procedures include initial and ongoing reviews of pricing methodologies and trends. The Company seeks to ensure prices represent reasonable estimates of fair value through the use of broker quotes, current sales transactions from the portfolio and pricing techniques, which are based on the net present value of future expected cash flows discounted at a rate of return
market participants would require. As a result of this analysis, if the Company determines there is a more appropriate fair value, the price is adjusted accordingly.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts business. A framework has been established for measuring the fair value of financial instruments that considers the attributes specific to particular assets or liabilities and includes a three-level hierarchy for determining fair value based on the transparency of inputs to each valuation as of the measurement date. The Company estimates the fair value of financial instruments using a variety of valuation methods. When financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used for fair value and are classified as Level 1. When financial instruments, such as investment securities and derivatives, are not actively traded, the Company determines fair value based on various sources and may apply matrix pricing with observable prices for similar instruments where a price for the identical instrument is not observable. The fair values of these financial instruments, which are classified as Level 2, are determined by pricing models that consider observable market data such as interest rate volatilities, yield curve, credit spreads, prices from external market data providers and/or nonbinding broker-dealer quotations. When observable inputs do not exist, the Company estimates fair value based on available market data, and these values are classified as Level 3. Imprecision in estimating fair values can impact the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the amount of revenue or loss recorded.
Deferred Tax Asset
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as prescribed by GAAP. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. If currently available information indicates it is “more likely than not” that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Accounting for deferred income taxes is a critical accounting estimate because the Company exercises significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. Management’s determination of the realization of deferred tax assets is based upon management’s judgment of various future events and uncertainties, including the timing and amount of future income, reversing temporary differences which may offset, and the implementation of various tax plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset. These judgments and estimates are inherently subjective and reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require the Company to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period, which would negatively affect earnings.
Results of Operations
Net Income
2020 Compared to 2019
Net income was $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a 13.4% decrease compared to net income of $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net income per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0.93, a 10.9% decrease, compared to $1.05 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was significantly impacted by increased provisions for loan losses, primarily attributable to economic uncertainties and evolving risks driven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and non-recurring charges of $7.0 million related to prepayment fees associated with the early retirement of $94.0 million of FHLB term advances which had a weighted average rate of 2.83%. ROA was 1.04% and 1.49% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. ROE was 10.51% and 13.50% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
2019 Compared to 2018
Net income was $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a 16.7% increase over net income of $26.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net income per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1.05, a 14.5% increase, compared to $0.91 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2018. ROA was 1.49% and 1.51% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. ROE was 13.50% and 13.87% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Net Interest Income
The Company’s primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is impacted by the level of interest earning assets and related funding sources, as well as changes in the level of interest rates. The difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid for interest bearing liabilities is the net interest spread. Noninterest bearing sources of funds, such as demand deposits and shareholders’ equity, also support earning assets. The impact of the noninterest bearing sources of funds is captured in the net interest margin, which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets. Both the net interest margin and net interest spread are presented on a tax-equivalent basis, which means that tax-free interest income has been adjusted to pretax-equivalent income, assuming a 21% federal tax rate. Management’s ability to respond to changes in interest rates by using effective asset-liability management techniques is critical to maintaining the stability of the net interest margin and the momentum of the Company’s primary source of earnings. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Open Market Committee decreased the targeted federal funds rate by a total of 150 basis points in March 2020, reaching a current range of 0.00 - 0.25%. This decrease may impact the comparability of net interest income between 2019 and 2020.
Average Balances and Yields
The following table presents, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the average balances of each principal category of assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity, and an analysis of net interest income. The average balances are principally daily averages and, for loans, include both performing and nonperforming balances. Interest income on loans includes the effects of net deferred loan origination fees and costs accounted for as yield adjustments. These tables are presented on a tax-equivalent basis, if applicable.
(1) Interest income and average rates for investments and loans are presented on a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 21%.
(2) Average loan balances include nonaccrual loans. Interest income on loans includes amortization of deferred loan fees, net of deferred loan costs.
(3) Net interest margin includes the tax equivalent adjustment and represents the annualized results of: (i) the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and the interest expense on interest bearing liabilities, divided by (ii) average interest earning assets for the period.
Interest Rates and Operating Interest Differential
Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table presents the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on interest earning assets and the interest incurred on interest bearing liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous period’s average rate. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average rate by the previous period’s volume. The changes not attributable specifically to either volume or rate have been allocated to the changes due to volume. The following table presents the changes in the volume and rate of interest bearing assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, and for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.
Interest Income, Interest Expense, and Net Interest Margin
2020 Compared to 2019
Net interest income was $88.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $13.8 million, or 18.7%, compared to $74.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net interest income was
largely attributable to growth in average interest earning assets, lower rates paid on deposits, and the recognition of PPP loan origination fees, offset partially by declining yields on loans and higher average balances of subordinated debentures.
Net interest margin (on a fully tax-equivalent basis) for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 3.46%, compared to 3.59% for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of 13 basis points. Despite a significant reduction in interest bearing deposit costs throughout the year, the historically low interest rate environment coupled with a more liquid balance sheet mix pressured earning asset yields lower and ultimately compressed net interest margin. Furthermore, the Company’s subordinated debenture issuance and the PPP loan origination volumes occurring during the year had a negative impact on net interest margin.
Average interest earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $474.7 million, or 22.7%, to $2.57 billion from $2.09 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase in average interest earning assets was due to continued organic growth in the loan portfolio as a result of increased loan production, including the funding of PPP loans. Average interest bearing liabilities increased $298.9 million, or 20.5%, to $1.76 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $1.46 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in average interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to an increase in interest bearing deposits and the issuance of subordinated debentures in the second quarter of 2020, partially offset by a decrease in notes payable and overall higher levels of on-balance sheet liquidity.
Average interest earning assets produced a tax-equivalent yield of 4.51% for year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 5.01% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was 1.53% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2.03% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Interest Income. Total interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was $115.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $104.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $11.1 million, or 10.6%, increase in total interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was primarily due to continued organic growth in the loan portfolio, as well as PPP loan interest and fee income.
Interest income on cash investments decreased $585,000, or 77.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, despite a $33.8 million, or 72.8%, increase in average cash balances, due to the falling interest rate environment. The increase in average cash balances was due to extraordinary deposit inflows. Interest income on the investment securities portfolio on a fully-tax equivalent basis increased $838,000, or 9.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a $71.5 million, or 28.5%, increase in average balances between the two periods, which was partially offset by a 51 basis point decrease in the aggregate portfolio yield, driven by the historically low interest rate environment.
Interest income on loans on a fully-tax equivalent basis for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $105.6 million, compared to $94.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $10.8 million, or 11.3%, increase was due to a $368.5 million, or 20.6%, increase in the average balance of loans outstanding, which was offset partially by a 41 basis point decrease in the average yield on loans, 9 basis points of which was attributed to the origination of PPP loans. The increase in the average balance of loans outstanding was due to organic loan growth and the funding of PPP loans. The decrease in yield on the loan portfolio was primarily due to the falling interest rate environment and the impact of PPP loans originated at a lower rate than the aggregate loan portfolio yield. The aggregate loan yield, excluding PPP loans, decreased to 4.99% for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was 32 basis points lower than 5.31% for the year ended December 31, 2019. While loan fees have maintained a stable contribution to the aggregate loan yield, the historically low yield curve has resulted in a declining core yield on loans in comparison to prior periods.
The following table presents a summary of interest and fees recognized on loans, excluding PPP loans, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
Interest Expense. Interest expense on interest bearing liabilities decreased $2.8 million, or 9.4%, to $26.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The cost of interest bearing liabilities declined 50 basis points to 1.53% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2.03% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decline was primarily due to lower rates paid on deposits, offset partially by growth of interest bearing deposits and additional subordinated debentures.
Interest expense on deposits decreased to $19.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $24.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $4.2 million, or 17.4%, decrease in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to deposit rate cuts consistent with a lower rate environment and the repricing of time deposits. The cost of total deposits declined 49 basis points from 1.42% for the year ended December 31, 2019, to 0.93% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Interest expense on borrowings increased $1.4 million to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was due to the issuance of additional subordinated debentures in 2020.
Given strong deposit inflows and ample time deposit maturities over the next 12 months, the Company anticipates continued deposit repricing opportunities in the future. Moreover, the significant FHLB de-leveraging strategy executed in the fourth quarter of 2020 will begin to manifest lower interest bearing liability costs in subsequent quarters.
2019 Compared to 2018
Net interest income was $74.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $9.4 million, or 14.5%, compared to $64.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net interest income was largely attributable to growth in average interest earning assets, particularly strong organic growth in the loan portfolio.
Net interest margin (on a fully tax-equivalent basis) for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 3.59%, compared to 3.72% for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of 13 basis points. While net interest margin has benefitted from the repricing of variable rate loans and the origination of new loans at higher rates, this was outpaced by increased balances and rates on deposits and borrowings.
Average interest earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $324.7 million, or 18.4%, to $2.09 billion from $1.77 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase in average interest earning assets was due to continued organic growth in the loan portfolio as a result of increased loan production. Average interest bearing liabilities increased $217.2 million, or 17.5%, to $1.46 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $1.24 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in average interest bearing liabilities was due to an increase in interest bearing deposits and FHLB advances, partially offset by a decrease in federal funds purchased and notes payable.
Average interest earning assets produced a tax-equivalent yield of 5.01% for year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 4.88% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was 2.03% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 1.65% for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Interest Income. Total interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was $104.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $86.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $18.4 million, or 21.4%, increase in total interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was primarily due to strong organic growth in the loan portfolio and an increase in the average yield on loans.
Interest income on cash investments increased $505,000, or 202.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, due to increased liquidity, which resulted from strong deposit growth. Interest income on the investment securities portfolio on a fully-tax equivalent basis increased $974,000, or 12.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a 33 basis point increase in the aggregate portfolio yield.
Interest income on loans for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $94.9 million, compared to $78.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $16.8 million, or 21.6%, increase was due to a $294.8 million, or 19.8%, increase in the average balance of loans outstanding and an 8 basis point increase in the average yield on loans. The increase in the average balance of loans outstanding was due to organic loan growth. The increase in yield on the loan portfolio resulted primarily from strong loan growth at yields accretive to the existing portfolio yield and has enabled the Company to offset the decreases in loan fee income. While deferred fees are regularly amortized into income, fluctuations in the level of loan fees recognized can vary based on prepayments and other factors.
Interest Expense. Interest expense on interest bearing liabilities increased $9.2 million, or 44.7%, to $29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, due to increases in market interest rates and growth in average balances of both deposits and borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in average balances of federal funds purchased.
Interest expense on deposits increased to $24.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $8.0 million, or 50.2%, increase in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to the average balance of interest bearing deposits increasing $189.9, or 17.4%, combined with a 41 basis point increase in the average rate paid. The increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits resulted primarily from increases in interest bearing transaction deposits, savings and money market deposits, time deposits and brokered deposits. The increase in the average rate paid was primarily due to the impact of higher market interest rates demanded on deposits in the local and wholesale markets.
Interest expense on borrowings increased $1.1 million to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to increased rates and average balances of FHLB advances, offset in part by a reduction in interest expense on federal funds purchased and notes payable as a result of a decrease in the average balances of these types of borrowings.
Provision for Loan Losses
2020 Compared to 2019
The allowance for loan losses increased $12.3 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to December 31, 2019, reflecting a provision for loan losses of $12.8 million and net charge-offs of $435,000 during 2020. The provision for loan losses was $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $10.1 million, compared to the provision for loan losses of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in the provision for loan losses relates primarily to growth of the loan portfolio, economic uncertainties and evolving risks driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The allowance for loan losses to total loans was 1.50% at December 31, 2020, compared to 1.18% at December 31, 2019. The allowance for loan losses to total loans, excluding $138.5 million of PPP loans, was 1.59% at December 31, 2020.
As an emerging growth company, the Company is not subject to Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses of Financial Instruments,” or CECL, until January 1, 2023.
2019 Compared to 2018
The allowance for loan losses increased $2.5 million as of December 31, 2019, compared to December 31, 2018, reflecting a provision for loan losses of $2.7 million and net charge-offs of $205,000 during 2019. The provision for loan losses was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $875,000, compared to the provision for loan losses of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, due primarily to continued strength in credit quality and consistent performance of the loan portfolio.
The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 represented 1.18% of gross loans outstanding, compared to 1.20% at December 31, 2018.
The following table presents a summary of the activity in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:
Noninterest Income
2020 Compared to 2019
Noninterest income was $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $2.0 million, or 52.6%. The increase was primarily due to increases in gains on sales of securities, letter of credit fees, and swap fees.
2019 Compared to 2018
Noninterest income was $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $1.3 million, or 50.5%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in gains on sales of securities and foreclosed assets and an increase in swap fees, partially offset by decreased letter of credit fees.
The following table presents the major components of noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, and for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018:
Noninterest Expense
2020 Compared to 2019
Noninterest expense totaled $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a $8.5 million, or 22.9% increase from $36.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by a $3.5 million increase in salaries and employee benefits as the result of merit increases and increased staff to meet the needs of the Company’s growth, and a $7.0 million non-recurring prepayment fee associated with the extinguishment of $94.0 million of FHLB term advances. The increases were partially offset by a decrease of $2.5 million in amortization of tax credit investments and a decrease of $719,000 in marketing and advertising expenses.
Full-time equivalent employees increased from 160 as of December 31, 2019, to 183 as of December 31, 2020. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company continues to attract strategic hires in lending, deposit gathering, technology and risk management roles.
Efficiency Ratio. The efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, reports total noninterest expense, less amortization of intangible assets, as a percentage of net interest income plus total noninterest income less gains (losses) on sales of securities. Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides a meaningful comparison of operational performance and facilitates investors’ assessments of business performance and trends in comparison to peers in the banking industry. The Company’s efficiency ratio, and its comparability to some peers, is negatively impacted by the amortization of tax credit investments, as well as other non-routine items, within noninterest expense.
The efficiency ratio was 49.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 47.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The amortization of tax credit investments elevated the level of operating expenses in both years, and while the recognition of the tax credits increases operating expenses, and concurrently the efficiency ratio, it directly reduces income tax expense and the effective tax rate. The adjusted efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, which excludes the impact of certain non-routine income and expenses from noninterest expense, decreased to 40.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 43.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The efficiencies of the Company's "branch-light" model have been evident throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and going forward, have positioned the Company well to continue making investments in technology as the industry adapts to evolving client behavior.
2019 Compared to 2018
Noninterest expense totaled $36.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a $5.4 million, or 17.0% increase from $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by a $3.5 million
increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $734,000 increase in occupancy and equipment, and a $565,000 increase in professional and consulting fees. The increases were partially offset by a decrease of $180,000 in FDIC Insurance Assessment due to a credit from the FDIC for a portion of premiums previously paid to the DIF that became refundable when the DIF exceeded 1.38% of insured deposits, which occurred during the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company has no remaining credits as of December 31, 2019.
Full-time equivalent employees increased from 140 as of December 31, 2018, to 160 as of December 31, 2019.
The efficiency ratio was 47.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019, a marginal increase over 46.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The amortization of tax credit investments elevated the level of operating expenses in both years, and while the recognition of the tax credits increases operating expenses, and concurrently the efficiency ratio, it directly reduces income tax expense and the effective tax rate. The adjusted efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, which excludes the impact of the amortization of tax credit investments, increased slightly to 43.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 41.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The following table presents the major components of noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, and the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018:
The Company expects future increases in noninterest expense as the Company continues investing in infrastructure to support balance sheet growth, particularly occupancy and equipment expenses related to the new corporate headquarters. Management remains focused on supporting growth primarily by adding to staff, investing in technology, and by enhancing risk controls. At the same time, management seeks to contain costs whenever prudent, which is evident in the stable nature of the adjusted efficiency ratio.
Income Tax Expense
The provision for income taxes includes both federal and state taxes. Fluctuations in effective tax rates reflect the differences in the inclusion or deductibility of certain income and expenses for income tax purposes. The Company’s future effective income tax rate will fluctuate based on the mix of taxable and tax-free investments and loans, the recognition and availability of tax credit investments, and overall taxable income.
2020 Compared to 2019
Income tax expense was $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The effective combined federal and state income tax rate for the year ended December
31, 2020 was 23.8%, compared to 18.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The higher effective combined rate was primarily due to fewer tax credits being recognized during 2020.
The recognition of tax credit investments significantly impacts the Company’s effective tax rate. Excluding the impact of tax credit investments, the effective combined federal and state income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 25.8%.
2019 Compared to 2018
Income tax expense was $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The effective combined federal and state income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 18.1%, compared to 16.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The higher effective combined rate was primarily due to fewer tax credits being recognized during 2019.
The recognition of tax credit investments significantly impacts the Company’s effective tax rate. Excluding the impact of tax credit investments, the effective combined federal and state income tax rate was 24.8% and 25.5% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Financial Condition
Overview
Total assets at December 31, 2020 were $2.93 billion, an increase of $658.5 million, or 29.0%, from December 31, 2019. The increase in total assets was primarily due to organic loan growth, PPP loan growth, purchases of investment securities, and excess cash balances linked to extraordinary deposit inflows. Total gross loans were $2.33 billion, an increase of $414.4 million, or 21.7%, from December 31, 2019. Securities available for sale were $390.6 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $100.8 million, or 34.8%, from December 31, 2019.
Total liabilities at December 31, 2020 were $2.66 billion, an increase of $637.9 million, or 31.5%, from December 31, 2019. Total deposits were $2.50 billion, an increase of $678.3 million, or 37.2%, from December 31, 2019. Total borrowings were $142.2 million, a decrease of $32.0 million, or 18.4%, from December 31, 2019.
Investment Securities Portfolio
The investment securities portfolio is used to make various term investments and is intended to provide the Company with adequate liquidity, a source of stable income, and at times, serve as collateral for certain types of deposits. Investment balances in the investment securities portfolio are subject to change over time based on funding needs and interest rate risk management objectives. The liquidity levels take into account anticipated future cash flows and are maintained at levels management believes are appropriate to ensure future flexibility in meeting anticipated funding needs.
The investment securities portfolio consists primarily of municipal securities, U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities, SBA securities, and corporate securities comprised of subordinated debentures of banks and financial holding companies. In addition, the Company also holds U.S. treasury securities, asset-backed securities and other debt securities, all with varying contractual maturities. These maturities do not necessarily represent the expected life of the securities as the securities may be called or paid down without penalty prior to their stated maturities. All investment securities are held as available for sale.
Securities available for sale were $390.6 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $289.9 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $100.8 million, or 34.8%. At December 31, 2020, municipal securities represented 29.4% of the investment securities portfolio, government agency mortgage-backed securities represented 31.6% of the portfolio, SBA securities represented 10.3% of the portfolio, corporate securities represented 18.5% of the portfolio,
asset-backed securities represented 10.0% of the portfolio, and other mortgage-backed securities represented 0.2% of the portfolio.
The following table presents the amortized cost and fair value of securities available for sale, by type, at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
The following tables present the fair value of securities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 by their stated maturities, as well as the fully tax-equivalent yields for each maturity range.
Loan Portfolio
The Company focuses on lending to borrowers located or investing in the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, MN-WI Metropolitan Statistical Area across a diverse range of industries and property types. The Company lends primarily to commercial customers, consisting of loans secured by nonfarm, nonresidential properties, multifamily residential properties, land, and non-real estate business assets. Responsive service, local decision making, and an efficient turnaround time from application to closing have been significant factors in growing the loan portfolio.
The Company manages concentrations of credit exposure through a risk management program which implements formalized processes and procedures specifically for managing and mitigating risk within the loan portfolio. The processes and procedures include board and management oversight, commercial real estate exposure limits, portfolio monitoring tools, management information systems, market reports, underwriting standards, internal and external loan review, and stress testing.
The Company originated net loan exposures of $1.45 billion, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $954.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net loan exposures include principal advances and unfunded commitments on newly originated loans, net of loan participations sold and PPP loan originations. Total gross loans increased $414.4 million, or 21.7%, to $2.33 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $1.91 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase included $138.5 million of PPP loans. The multifamily and commercial real estate, or CRE, nonowner occupied categories contributed most significantly to the $275.9 million of net loan growth, excluding PPP loans. As of December 31, 2020, multifamily loans increased $111.5 million, or 21.6%, and nonowner occupied CRE loans increased $116.8 million, or 19.7%, when compared to December 31, 2019. The Company’s loan growth for the year ended December 31, 2020, excluding PPP loans, was 14.4%.
The following table presents the dollar and percentage composition of the loan portfolio by category, at the dates indicated:
The Company’s primary focus has been on real estate mortgage lending, which constituted 73.3% of the portfolio as of December 31, 2020. The composition of the portfolio has remained relatively consistent with prior periods and the Company does not expect any significant changes in the foreseeable future in the composition of the loan portfolio or in the emphasis on real estate lending.
As of December 31, 2020, investor CRE loans totaled $1.51 billion, consisting of $709.3 million of loans secured by nonowner occupied CRE, $626.5 million of loans secured by multifamily residential properties and $170.2 million of construction and land development loans. Investor CRE loans represented 68.8% of the total gross loan portfolio, excluding PPP loans, and 455.8% of the Bank’s total risk-based capital at December 31, 2020, compared to 516.6% at December 31, 2019.
The following table presents time to contractual maturity and sensitivity to interest rate changes for the loan portfolio at December 31, 2020:
Asset Quality
The Company emphasizes credit quality in the originating and monitoring of the loan portfolio, and success in underwriting is measured by the levels of classified and nonperforming assets and net charge-offs. Federal regulations and internal policies require the use of an asset classification system as a means of managing and reporting problem and potential problem assets. The Company has incorporated an internal asset classification system, substantially consistent with federal banking regulations, as a part of the credit monitoring system. Federal banking regulations set forth a classification scheme for problem and potential problem assets as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss” assets. An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the financial institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are required to be designated “watch.”
The following table presents information on loan classifications at December 31, 2020. The Company had no assets classified as doubtful or loss.
The Company has increased oversight and analysis of all segments of the loan portfolio in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in vulnerable industries such as hospitality and restaurants, to proactively monitor evolving credit risk. Loans that have potential weaknesses that warrant a watchlist risk rating at December 31, 2020, were $44.8 million, compared to $5.3 million at December 31, 2019. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, the length and extent of the economic uncertainty may result in further watchlist or adverse classifications in the loan portfolio. Loans that warranted a substandard risk rating at December 31, 2020 were $15.2 million, compared to $2.7 at December 31, 2019. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company had $8.4 million of substandard loans payoff in the CRE nonowner occupied segment of the portfolio.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has been offering loan modifications, when appropriate, to borrowers who were current and otherwise not past due as of December 31, 2019. These include modifications in the form of payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment. In accordance with interagency regulatory guidance and the CARES Act, qualifying loans modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are not considered TDRs.
The following table presents a rollforward of loan modification activity, by modification type, for the year ended December 31, 2020:
The following table presents a summary of active loan modifications, by loan segment and modification type, at December 31, 2020:
Modifications have been granted on a case-by-case basis based on specific needs and circumstances affecting each borrower. Interest-only modifications have been primarily granted for three to six-month periods, but range up to twelve months. Payment deferral modifications have been granted for three to six-month periods.
Nonperforming Assets
Nonperforming loans include loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis and loans 90 days past due and still accruing. Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans plus foreclosed assets (i.e., real or personal property acquired through foreclosure). Nonaccrual loans totaled $775,000 at December 31, 2020 and $461,000 at December 31, 2019, an increase of $314,000. There were no loans 90 days past due and still accruing as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. There were no foreclosed assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The following table presents a summary of nonperforming assets, by category, at the dates indicated:
(1) Nonperforming assets are defined as nonaccrual loans and loans greater than 90 days past due still accruing plus foreclosed assets. There were no loans greater than 90 days past due still accruing for any period shown.
The balance of nonperforming assets can fluctuate due to changes in economic conditions. The Company has established a policy to discontinue accruing interest on a loan (that is, place the loan on nonaccrual status) after it has become 90 days delinquent as to payment of principal or interest, unless the loan is considered to be well-collateralized and is actively in the process of collection. In addition, a loan will be placed on nonaccrual status before it becomes 90 days delinquent unless management believes that the collection of interest is expected. Interest previously accrued but uncollected on such loans is reversed and charged against current income when the receivable is determined to be uncollectible. If management believes that a loan will not be collected in full, an increase to the allowance for loan losses is recorded to reflect management’s estimate of any potential exposure or loss. Generally, payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied directly to principal. There are not any loans, outside of those included in the tables above, that cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of borrowers to comply with present repayment terms. Due to the low levels of nonaccrual loans, gross income that would have been recorded on nonaccrual loans is $27,000.
Allowance for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses. The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level management considers adequate to provide for known and probable incurred losses in the portfolio. The level of the allowance is based on management’s evaluation of estimated losses in the portfolio, after consideration of risk characteristics of the loans and prevailing and anticipated economic conditions. Loan charge-offs (i.e., loans judged to be uncollectible) are charged against the reserve and any subsequent recovery is credited to the reserve. The Company analyzes risks within the loan portfolio on a continual basis. A risk system, consisting of multiple grading categories for each portfolio class, is utilized as an analytical tool to assess risk and appropriate reserves. In addition to the risk system, management further evaluates risk characteristics of the loan portfolio under current and anticipated economic conditions, including the economic distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and considers such factors as the financial condition of the borrower, past and expected loss experience, and other factors which management feels deserve recognition in establishing an appropriate reserve. These estimates are reviewed at least quarterly, and as adjustments become necessary, they are recognized in the periods in which they become known. Although management strives to maintain an allowance it deems adequate, future economic changes, deterioration of borrowers’ creditworthiness, and the impact of examinations by regulatory agencies all could cause changes to the allowance for loan losses.
At December 31, 2020, the allowance for loan losses was $34.8 million, an increase of $12.3 million from $22.5 million at December 31, 2019. Net charge-offs totaled $435,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 and $205,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.50% at December 31, 2020 and 1.18% at December 31, 2019. The allowance for loan losses to total loans, excluding $138.5 million of PPP loans, was 1.59% at December 31, 2020. Based on current economic indicators, the Company increased the economic factors within the allowance for loan losses evaluation, primarily in response to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The following table presents a summary of the activity in the allowance for loan loss reserve for the periods indicated:
The following table presents a summary of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan portfolio segment for the periods indicated:
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill was $2.6 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired, which originated from the acquisition of First National Bank of the Lakes in May of 2016. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to, at a minimum, an annual test for impairment. Other intangible assets consist of core deposit relationships and favorable lease term intangibles. Total other intangible assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $670,000 and $861,000, respectively. Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life.
Deposits
The principal sources of funds for the Company are deposits, consisting of demand deposits, money market accounts, savings accounts, and certificates of deposit. The following table presents the dollar and percentage composition of the deposit portfolio, by category, at the dates indicated:
Total deposits at December 31, 2020 were $2.50 billion, an increase of $678.3 million, or 37.2%, compared to total deposits of $1.82 billion at December 31, 2019. Noninterest bearing deposits were $671.9 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $224.4 million, or 50.1%, compared to $447.5 million at December 31, 2019. Noninterest bearing deposits comprised 26.9% of total deposits at December 31, 2020, compared to 24.5% at December 31, 2019. The growth in noninterest bearing transaction deposits was a result of both successful new client acquisition initiatives and pandemic-related accumulation of liquidity in existing client accounts. The Company believes that deposit levels could fluctuate in future periods as a result of the uncertain economic conditions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Company relies on increasing the deposit base to fund loan and other asset growth. The Company is in a highly competitive market and competes for local deposits by offering attractive products with competitive rates. The Company expects to have a higher average cost of funds for local deposits compared to competitor banks due to the lack of an extensive branch network. The Company’s strategy is to offset the higher cost of funding with a lower level of operating expense. When appropriate, the Company utilizes alternative funding sources such as brokered deposits. At December 31, 2020, total brokered deposits were $452.3 million or 18.1% of total deposits, compared to total brokered deposits of $234.4 million, or 12.9% of total deposits at December 31, 2019. Brokered deposits increased as a result of a change in mix of wholesale funding sources due to favorable funding costs offered compared to other wholesale funding alternatives. Furthermore, the brokered deposit market provides flexibility in structure, optionality and efficiency not afforded in traditional retail deposit channels.
The following table presents the average balance and average rate paid on each of the following deposit categories for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:
The following table presents time deposits, including brokered time deposits, of $100,000 or more, by time remaining until maturity.
Borrowed Funds
Federal Funds Purchased
In addition to deposits, the Company utilizes overnight borrowings to meet the daily liquidity needs of clients and fund loan growth. The following table presents a summary of overnight borrowings, which consist of federal funds purchased from correspondent banks on an overnight basis at the prevailing overnight market rates and the weighted average interest rates paid for the periods presented:
Other Borrowings
At December 31, 2020, other borrowings outstanding consisted of FHLB advances of $57.5 million and a note payable of $11.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company prepaid $94.0 million of fixed rate FHLB term advances with an average cost of 2.83% and incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $7.0 million. The $11.0 million note payable matured in February 2021 and was paid off in full at maturity.
As part of the CARES Act, the Federal Reserve Bank offered secured borrowings to banks who originated PPP loans through the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility, or PPPLF. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had not pledged any PPP loans to borrow funds under this facility. The facility is available through June 30, 2021. The Company’s borrowing capacity at the FHLB is determined based on collateral pledged, generally consisting of loans. The Company had additional borrowing capacity under this credit facility of $361.2 million and $209.8 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
Additionally, the Company has borrowing capacity from other sources. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank was eligible to use the Federal Reserve discount window for borrowings. Based on assets pledged as collateral as of the applicable date, the Bank’s borrowing availability was approximately $76.8 million and $113.2 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had no outstanding advances from the discount window.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company has a swap agreement with an unaffiliated third party in order to hedge interest rate risk associated with the note payable. This agreement provides for the Company to make payments at a fixed rate in exchange for receiving payments at a variable rate determined by one-month LIBOR. The swap agreement matured in February 2021.
Subordinated Debentures
On June 19, 2020, the Company issued $50.0 million of subordinated debentures at an initial fixed interest rate of 5.25% which is payable semi-annually. Beginning July 1, 2025, the interest rate converts to a variable interest rate equal to the three-month term SOFR, plus 5.13%, which is payable quarterly. The subordinated debentures mature on July 1, 2030. The subordinated debentures, net of issuance costs, were $48.9 million at December 31, 2020. On October 13, 2020, the Company completed an offer to exchange up to $50.0 million total principal amount of the subordinated debentures for substantially identical subordinated debentures registered under the Securities Act of 1933, in satisfaction of the Company’s obligations under a registration rights agreement entered into with the initial purchasers of the subordinated debentures. $47.0 million of the $50.0 million of the subordinated debentures were exchanged in the exchange offer.
On July 12, 2017, the Company issued $25.0 million of subordinated debentures at an initial fixed interest rate of 5.875% which is payable semi-annually. Beginning July 15, 2022, the interest rate converts to a variable interest rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 3.88%. The subordinated debentures mature on July 15, 2027. The subordinated debentures, net of issuance costs, were $24.8 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $24.7 million at December 31, 2019.
All of the subordinated debentures qualify for Tier 2 regulatory capital treatment at the Company level under applicable regulatory guidelines.
Contractual Obligations
The following table presents supplemental information regarding total contractual obligations at December 31, 2020:
Operating lease obligations are in place for facilities and land on which banking branches are located. See Note 6 of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements included as part of this report for additional information.
The Company believes that it will be able to meet all contractual obligations as they come due through the maintenance of adequate cash levels. The Company expects to maintain adequate cash levels through earnings, loan and securities repayments and maturity activity and continued deposit gathering activities. As described above, the Company has in place various borrowing mechanisms for both short-term and long-term liquidity needs.
Shareholders’ Equity
Shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2020 was $265.4 million, an increase of $20.6 million, or 8.4%, over shareholders’ equity of $244.8 million at December 31, 2019, primarily due to $27.2 million of net income retained and a $1.8 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by $10.3 million of stock repurchases made under the Company’s stock repurchase program. The increase in accumulated other comprehensive income primarily resulted from interest rate fluctuations between periods.
Stock Repurchase Program. On January 22, 2019, the Company adopted a stock repurchase program. Under the stock repurchase program, the Company was initially authorized to repurchase up to $15.0 million of its common stock in open market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions at the Company’s discretion. On July 23, 2019 and October 27, 2020, the Company's board of directors approved $10.0 million and $15.0 million increases, respectively, to the program for a total authorization of $40.0 million. Additionally, on October 27, 2020, the program duration was extended to run through October 27, 2022.
The Company remains committed to maintaining strong capital levels while enhancing shareholder value as it strategically executes its stock repurchase program in this fluid economic environment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased 940,781 shares of its common stock, representing approximately 3% of the Company's outstanding shares. Shares were repurchased at a weighted average price of $10.98 for a total of $10.3 million. All shares repurchased under the stock repurchase program were converted to authorized but unissued shares. At December 31, 2020, the remaining amount that could be used to repurchase shares under the stock repurchase program was $14.7 million.
Regulatory Capital. The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by federal banking regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s and Bank’s business.
Under applicable regulatory capital rules, the Company and Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory
accounting practices. The Bank must also meet certain specific capital guidelines under the prompt corrective action framework. The capital amounts and classifications are subject to qualitative judgments by the federal banking regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets (referred to as the “leverage ratio”), as defined under the applicable regulatory capital rules.
Management believes the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject as of December 31, 2020. The regulatory capital ratios for the Company and the Bank to meet the minimum capital adequacy standards and for the Bank to be considered well capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework are set forth in the following tables. The Company’s and the Bank’s actual capital amounts and ratios are as of the dates indicated.
The Company and the Bank are subject to the rules of the Basel III regulatory capital framework and related Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The rules require a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% that was added to the minimum requirements for capital adequacy purposes. A banking organization with a conservation buffer of less than the required amount is subject to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, stock repurchases and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. At December 31, 2020, the ratios for the Company and the Bank were sufficient to meet the conservation buffer.
In 2019, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule to provide an optional simplified measure of capital adequacy for qualifying depository institutions and depository institution holding companies, titled the community bank leverage ratio, or CBLR framework. The Company has elected not to opt into the CBLR framework and will continue to compute regulatory capital ratios based on the Basel III Capital Rules discussed above.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various transactions to meet the financing needs of clients, which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in the consolidated balance sheets. These transactions include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Most of these commitments mature within two years and the standby letters of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon. All off-balance sheet commitments are included in the determination of the amount of risk-based capital that the Company and the Bank are required to hold.
The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. The Company decreases its exposure to losses under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. The Company assesses the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit and establishes a liability for probable credit losses.
The following table presents credit arrangements and financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:
Commitments to extend credit beyond current funding are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Such commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by us upon extension of credit, is based on our management’s credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties.
Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. Commercial letters of credit are issued specifically to facilitate trade or commerce and are paid directly when the underlying transaction is consummated. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers.
The Company had outstanding letters of credit with the FHLB in the amount of $60,091 and $108,502 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, on behalf of customers and to secure public deposits.
Liquidity
Liquidity is the Company’s capacity to meet cash and collateral obligations at a reasonable cost. Maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on the Company’s ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash flows and collateral needs without adversely affecting either daily operations or financial condition. The Bank’s ALM Committee, which is comprised of members of senior management, is responsible for managing commitments to meet the needs of customers while achieving the Company’s financial objectives. The ALM Committee meets regularly to review balance sheet composition, funding capacities, and current and forecasted loan demand.
The Company manages liquidity by maintaining adequate levels of cash and other assets from on- and off-balance sheet arrangements. Specifically, on-balance sheet liquidity consists of cash and due from banks and unpledged
investment securities available for sale, which are referred to as primary liquidity. In regards to off-balance sheet capacity, the Company maintains available borrowing capacity under secured borrowing lines with the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, as well as unsecured lines of credit for the purpose of overnight funds with various correspondent banks, which the Company refers to as secondary liquidity.
In addition, the Bank is a member of the American Financial Exchange, or AFX, through which it may either borrow or lend funds on an overnight or short-term basis with a group of approved commercial banks. The availability of funds changes daily. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had no borrowings outstanding through the AFX. The Bank has also established additional borrowing capacity through the Federal Reserve Bank’s PPPLF, where it can pledge PPP loans to borrow an equal amount of funds. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had no borrowings outstanding through this facility and $138.5 million of PPP loans available to pledge. The facility is available through June 30, 2021.
The following tables present a summary of primary and secondary liquidity levels as of the dates indicated:
During the year ended December 31, 2020, primary liquidity increased $214.2 million due to a $113.4 million increase in cash and cash equivalents and a $100.8 million increase in securities available for sale, when compared to December 31, 2019. Secondary liquidity increased $153.1 million as of December 31, 2020 when compared to December 31, 2019, due to a $151.4 million increase in the borrowing capacity on the secured borrowing line with the FHLB and a $38.0 million increase in unsecured borrowing capacity with correspondent lenders, offset partially by a $36.3 million decrease in the borrowing capacity on the secured credit line with the Federal Reserve Bank.
In addition to primary liquidity, the Company generates liquidity from cash flows from the loan and securities portfolios and from the large base of core customer deposits, defined as noninterest bearing transaction, interest bearing transaction, savings, non-brokered money market accounts and non-brokered time deposits less than $250,000. At December 31, 2020, core deposits totaled approximately $1.95 billion and represented 78.1% of total deposits. These core deposits are normally less volatile, often with customer relationships tied to other products offered by the Company, which promote long-standing relationships and stable funding sources.
The Company uses brokered deposits, the availability of which is uncertain and subject to competitive market forces and regulation, for liquidity management purposes. At December 31, 2020, brokered deposits totaled $452.3 million, consisting of $292.6 million of brokered time deposits and $159.7 million of non-maturity brokered money market and transaction accounts. At December 31, 2019, brokered deposits totaled $234.4 million, consisting of $231.9 million of brokered time deposits and $2.4 million of non-maturity brokered money market and transaction accounts.
The Company’s liquidity policy includes guidelines for On-Balance Sheet Liquidity (a measurement of primary liquidity to total deposits plus borrowings), Total On-Balance Sheet Liquidity with Borrowing Capacity (a measurement
of primary and secondary liquidity to total deposits plus borrowings), Wholesale Funding Ratio (a measurement of total wholesale funding to total deposits plus borrowings), and other guidelines developed for measuring and maintaining liquidity. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all established liquidity guidelines in the policy.
GAAP Reconciliation and Management Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Some of the financial data included in this report are not measures of financial performance recognized by GAAP. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in the analysis of performance:
● “Efficiency ratio” is defined as noninterest expense less the amortization of intangibles divided by our operating revenue, which is equal to net interest income plus noninterest income excluding gains and losses on sales of assets. In our judgment, the adjustments made to operating revenue allow investors and analysts to better assess our operating expenses in relation to our core operating revenue by removing the volatility that is associated with certain one-time items and other discrete items that are unrelated to our core business.
● “Adjusted Efficiency ratio” is defined as the efficiency ratio adjusted to exclude the amortization of tax credit investments and FHLB advance prepayments fees from noninterest expense.
● "Pre-Provision Net Revenue" is defined as net interest income plus total non-interest income (excluding all gains and losses) minus total non-interest expense, excluding the amortization of tax credit investments and FHLB advance prepayment fees.
● “Tangible common equity” is defined as shareholders’ equity reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets. We believe that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in changes from period to period in shareholders’ equity exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangibles that were recorded in a purchase business combination have the effect of increasing both equity and assets while not increasing our tangible equity or tangible assets.
● “Tangible common equity to tangible assets” is defined as the ratio of tangible common equity, as defined above, divided by total assets reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets. We believe that this measure is important to many investors in the market place who are interested in relative changes from period to period in shareholders’ equity to total assets, each exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangibles that were recorded in a purchase business combination have the effect of increasing both equity and assets while not increasing our tangible equity or tangible assets.
● “Tangible book value per share” is defined as tangible shareholders’ equity divided by total common voting and non-voting shares outstanding. We believe that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in changes from period to period in book value per share exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangibles that were recorded in a purchase business combination have the effect of increasing book value while not increasing our tangible book value.
The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to management and investors that is supplementary to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP; however, we acknowledge that our non-GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations. As such, you should not view these disclosures as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, and they are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP financial measures that other companies use. The following reconciliation table provides a more detailed analysis of these non-GAAP financial measures:
