Year Ended May 31, 2021 compared with the Year Ended May 31, 2020
The narrative comparison of results of operations for the years ended May 31, 2021 2020 is based on the following table. The table includes information on continuing operations. Discontinued operations are set out separately.
Revenues from debudder sales in the year ended May 31, 2021 decreased when compared to the same period in 2020. The decrease is largely attributable to general economic conditions affecting the small and hobby farm customers that comprise the bulk of the Company’s sales. A portion of the current fiscal year was also spent focusing on our discontinued operations and that focus diverted attention from our debudder product line and contributed to the sales decline.
Cost of revenues as a percentage of sales increased in the year ended May 31, 2021 when compared to the same period in 2020. The increase is attributable to the use of fulfillment centers for processing and shipping orders and storing inventory in all of 2021, compared to a partial year use of fulfillment centers in 2020. Management determined that fulfillment centers were a more efficient means of meeting customer demand than setting up our own order processing, packaging and shipping department due to the relatively low volume of products sold and the initial costs to establish these in house capabilities.
Other operating expenses decreased in the year ended May 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in impairment of intangible assets in 2021 compared to 2020, and more modest decreases in officer and director compensation and professional fees and contract services.
Net loss from operations decreased in 2021 compared with 2020. The decrease in the net loss is attributable to the factors identified above.
Non-operating Expenses.
In connection with a notes payable funding transaction that closed on March 22, 2021, the Company paid $3,683,000 in commitment fees on the notes in the form of 1,200,000 shares of common stock and 3,000,000 warrants to purchase shares exercisable at $0.38 per share with a three-year term ending March 22, 2024. These amounts are classified as non-operating expenses. The commitment fee shares were valued at $1,800,000. The warrants were valued at $1,883,000 using the Black-Scholes method . One half of the warrants may be redeemed for an aggregate payment of $1.00 by the Company if the notes payable are paid in full before September 22, 2021.
The debt investment also resulted in recording $378,442 in interest expense in 2021 compared with $2,976 in 2020 and $2,906,000 in financing fees expense in 2021 compared to none in 2020.
In addition, the Company subsequently invested $1,000,000 in PPK Investment Group, Inc. (doing business as Country Cannabis), a vertically integrated Oklahoma cannabis company. The investment included $620,000 from conversion of a convertible note and 1,520,000 shares of common stock valued for purposes of the acquisition at $380,000. On May 19, 2021, the closing date of the investment, the common stock closed on the OTCQB market at $0.64. The resulting value of the stock portion of the investment of $972,800. Management had determined that the fair value of the investment on May 19, 2021 was the negotiated price of $380,000 and an immediate impairment on the investment in the amount of $592,800 was recorded to reflect a carrying value of this portion of the investment of $380,000 and an aggregate investment of $1,000,000.
Discontinued Operations.
After operating the soils division that was acquired from Elevated Ag Solutions, Inc. (“Elevated”) in the year ended May 31, 2020, for the three months ended August 31, 2020, management undertook an in-depth assessment of the business and concluded that the soils division was not as represented at the time of the acquisition, was not likely to ever operate profitably without significant revisions to operating methods and changes in personnel and was likely to create significant business questions and concerns should it be continued. Accordingly, management elected to discontinue the business acquired from Elevated. Upon discontinuation of the Elevated business, the Company entered into a settlement and unwinding agreement with Elevated and returned all assets acquired in the transaction to Elevated. Common stock issued in the acquisition, aggregating 1,300,000 shares out of 1,400,000 shares originally issued, were cancelled, and the Company paid a $10,000 walk-away fee. In the aggregate, the Company recognized a loss from discontinued operations of $14,151 in the year ended May 31, 2021.
The Elevated operating results for the year ended May 31, 2021 compared to 2020 are reflected in the following table.
OPERATING RESULTS
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash flow used in operating activities for the year ended May 31, 2021 was $538,024 compared with $271,527 in 2020. During the period, our total cash increased by $90,976. Cash to fund the negative cash flow from operations was derived primarily from proceeds of advances from related parties totaling $488,000, and a net of $777,000 from the notes payable. The increase in our cash position at May 31, 2021 is largely attributable to the debt financing entered into on March 22, 2021.
Our historic operations have not been sufficient to support the existing infrastructure, much of which is required in order to maintain public company status. On March, 22, 2021, we entered into a debt funding transaction and made a loan to an operating cannabis company as described in more detail below. The debt funding transaction and the loan are steps in the targeted acquisition of the operating company PPK, and we expect that the eventual acquisition of PPK will improve our ability to support the infrastructure costs of maintaining our public company status. We also continue to seek out potential acquisition candidates with a focus on acquiring additional operating companies with scale sufficient to support all aspects of the Company’s operations, including the public company infrastructure. The Company is currently heavily dependent on funding through advances from related parties, but no assurances can be given that such funding will continue to be available in future periods. The debt funding matures on September 22, 2021 but may be extended for six months at an increased interest rate of 15% per annum. At this time, the Company anticipates that it will extend the notes through March 22, 2022.
We have maintained active operations as a manufacturer and distributor of the debudder product line since 2018. We do not consider the Company to be a shell company as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. We incurred net losses of $4,915,863 for the year ended May 31, 2021and had an accumulated deficit of $9,098,257 as of May 31, 2021. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company may seek to raise money for working capital purposes through a public offering of its equity capital or through a private placement of equity capital or convertible debt. It will be important for the Company to succeed in its efforts to raise capital in this manner to further its business plan in an aggressive manner. Raising additional capital may cause dilution to current shareholders.
