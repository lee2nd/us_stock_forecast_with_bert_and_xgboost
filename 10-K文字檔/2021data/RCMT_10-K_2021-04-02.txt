COVID-19 Considerations
The Company’s priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic are protecting the health and safety of our employees and, especially in the healthcare segment, deploying our resources, including the talents of our employees, to help the communities we serve meet and overcome the current challenges. In the future, the pandemic may continue to cause reduced demand for our services if, for example, the pandemic results in a prolonged recessionary economic environment affecting industries in which we serve; however, since certain services that we offer are essential to the daily lives of our customers, we believe that over the long term, there will continue to be demand for our services.
Our ability to continue to operate without any significant negative operational impact from the COVID-19 pandemic will in part depend on our ability to protect our employees and our supply chain. The Company has endeavored to follow the recommended actions of government and health authorities to protect our employees, with particular measures in place for those working in our customer facilities. For the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021, while our revenue, gross profit and operating income were negatively impacted, we maintained the consistency of our operations, to a substantial degree, during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We intend to continue to adhere to our employee safety measures as we seek to ensure that any disruptions to our operations remain as limited as possible during the pandemic. However, the uncertainty resulting from the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our workforce and supply chain (for example, an inability of a key supplier or transportation supplier to source and transport materials) that could negatively impact our operations.
For additional information on risk factors related to the pandemic or other risks that could impact our results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. For additional information on how COVID-19 has impacted operations and our financial position, please refer to the Segment Discussion and Liquidity and Capital Resources sections in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
RCM participates in a market that is cyclical in nature and sensitive to economic changes. As a result, the impact of economic changes on revenue and operations can be substantial, resulting in significant volatility in the Company’s financial performance.
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic, which continues to present various health, business and other challenges throughout the United States. As a result, we have temporarily closed most of our office locations, with most of our workforce working from home, and have seen a reduction in customer demand, all resulting in a negative impact on Company revenue, gross profit and operating income. The duration and ultimate magnitude of the disruption remains uncertain. We experienced a negative impact in fiscal 2020 and we expect this matter to negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial position also through at least the first half of fiscal 2021 and likely beyond. The related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Please see more detailed disclosure by segment in our Segment Discussion and the impact to our consolidated financial position under Financial Activities under Liquidity and Capital Resources, all in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The Company believes it has developed and assembled an attractive portfolio of capabilities, established a proven record of performance and credibility and built an efficient pricing structure. The Company is committed to optimizing its business model as a single-source premier provider of business and technology solutions with a strong vertical focus offering an integrated suite of services through a global delivery platform.
The Company believes that most companies recognize the importance of advanced technologies and business processes to compete in today’s business climate. However, the process of designing, developing and implementing business and technology solutions is becoming increasingly complex. The Company believes that many businesses today are focused on return on investment analysis in prioritizing their initiatives. This has had an adverse impact on spending by current and prospective clients for many emerging new solutions.
Nonetheless, the Company continues to believe that businesses must implement more advanced information technology and engineering solutions to upgrade their systems, applications and processes so that they can maximize their productivity and optimize their performance in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Although working under budgetary, personnel and expertise constraints, companies are driven to support increasingly complex systems, applications and processes of significant strategic value. This has given rise to a demand for outsourcing. The Company believes that its current and prospective clients are continuing to evaluate the potential for outsourcing business critical systems, applications and processes.
The Company provides project management and consulting services, which are billed based on either agreed-upon fixed fees or hourly rates, or a combination of both. The billing rates and profit margins for project management and solutions services are generally higher than those for professional consulting services. The Company generally endeavors to expand its sales of higher margin solutions and project management services. The Company also realizes revenue from client engagements that range from the placement of contract and temporary technical consultants to project assignments that entail the delivery of end-to-end solutions. These services are primarily provided to the client at hourly rates that are established for each of the Company’s consultants based upon their skill level, experience and the type of work performed.

Overview (Continued)
The majority of the Company’s services are provided under purchase orders. Contracts are utilized on certain of the more complex assignments where the engagements are for longer terms or where precise documentation on the nature and scope of the assignment is necessary. Although contracts normally relate to longer-term and more complex engagements, they do not obligate the customer to purchase a minimum level of services and are generally terminable by the customer on 60 to 90 days’ notice. The Company, from time to time, enters into contracts requiring the completion of specific deliverables. Typically these contracts are for less than one year. The Company recognizes revenue on these deliverables at the time the client accepts and approves the deliverables.
Costs of services consist primarily of salaries and compensation-related expenses for billable consultants and employees, including payroll taxes, employee benefits and insurance. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits of personnel responsible for business development, recruiting, operating activities, and training, and include corporate overhead expenses. Corporate overhead expenses relate to salaries and benefits of personnel responsible for corporate activities, including the Company’s corporate marketing, administrative and financial reporting responsibilities and acquisition program. The Company records these expenses when incurred. Corporate overhead expenses are allocated to the segments based on revenue for the purpose of segment financial reporting.
Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates
This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. In our consolidated financial statements, estimates are used for, but not limited to, accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill, long-lived intangible assets, accounting for stock options and restricted stock awards, insurance liabilities, accounting for income taxes and accrued bonuses.
Revenue Recognition
The Company records revenue under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Revenue is recognized when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring services promised in a contract to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services. Performance obligations in our contracts represent distinct or separate service streams that we provide to our customers.
We evaluate our revenue contracts with customers based on the five-step model under ASC 606: (1) Identify the contract with the customer; (2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) Determine the transaction price; (4) Allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations; and (5) Recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.
The Company derives its revenue from several sources. The Company’s Engineering Services and Information Technology Services segments perform consulting and project solution services. The Healthcare segment specializes in long-term and short-term staffing and placement services to hospitals, schools and long-term care facilities amongst others. All of the Company’s segments perform staff augmentation services and derive revenue from permanent placement fees. The majority of the Company’s revenue is invoiced on a time and materials basis.

Time and Material
The Company’s IT and Healthcare segments predominantly recognize revenue through time and material work while its Engineering segment recognizes revenue through both time and material and fixed fee work. The Company’s time and material contracts are typically based on the number of hours worked at contractually agreed upon rates, therefore revenue associated with these time and materials contracts are recognized based on hours worked at contracted rates.
Fixed fee
From time to time and predominantly in our Engineering segment, the Company will enter into contracts requiring the completion of specific deliverables. The Company has master services agreements with many of its customers that broadly define terms and conditions. Actual services performed under fixed fee arrangements are typically delivered under purchase orders that more specifically define terms and conditions related to that fixed fee project. While these master services agreements can often span several years, the Company’s fixed fee purchase orders are typically performed over six to nine month periods. In instances where project services are provided on a fixed-price basis, revenue is recorded in accordance with the terms of each contract. In certain instances, revenue is invoiced at the time certain milestones are reached, as defined in the contract. Revenue under these arrangements are recognized as the costs on these contracts are incurred. On an infrequent basis, amounts paid in excess of revenue earned and recognized are recorded as deferred revenue, included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying condensed balance sheets. In other instances, revenue is billed and recorded based upon contractual rates per hour. Additionally, some contracts contain “Performance Fees” (bonuses) for completing a contract under budget. Performance Fees, if any, are recorded when earned. Some contracts also limit revenue and billings to specified maximum amounts. Provisions for contract losses, if any, are made in the period such losses are determined. For contracts where there is a specific deliverable and the work is not complete and the revenue is not recognized, the costs incurred are deferred as a prepaid asset. The associated costs are expensed when the related revenue is recognized.
ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
Revenue Recognition (Continued)
Permanent Placement Services
The Company earns permanent placement fees from providing permanent placement services. These fees are typically based on a percentage of the compensation paid to the person placed with the Company’s client.
The deferred revenue balance as of January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019 was $0.4 million. These amounts are included in accounts payable and accrued expense in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at that date. Revenue is recognized when the service has been performed. Deferred revenue may be recognized over a period exceeding one year from the time it was recorded on the balance sheet, although this is an infrequent occurrence. For the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 and the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, the Company recognized revenue of $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively, that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the reporting period.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Company’s accounts receivable are primarily due from trade customers. Credit is extended based on evaluation of customers’ financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required. Accounts receivable payment terms vary and are stated in the financial statements at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due. The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, the Company’s previous loss history, the customer’s current ability to pay its obligation to the Company, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The Company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables previously written off are credited to bad debt expense.
Goodwill
Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 350 “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment” (“ASC Topic 350”). The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the last day of the Company’s fiscal December each year or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change indicating that the fair value of the goodwill may be below its carrying amount. The Company has three reporting units. The Company uses a market-based approach to determine the fair value of the reporting units. This approach uses earnings/revenue multiples of similar companies recently completing acquisitions and the ability of our reporting units to generate cash flows as measures of fair value of our reporting units. The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment” effective December 29, 2018 which has eliminated Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under this update, an entity should perform its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
There was no goodwill impairment in fiscal 2020 or 2019. During all periods presented, the Company determined that the existing qualitative factors did not suggest that an impairment of goodwill exists. There can be no assurance that future indicators of impairment and tests of goodwill impairment will not result in impairment charges for both its Engineering and Specialty Healthcare segments.
Long-Lived and Intangible Assets
The Company evaluates long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When the Company determines that it is probable that undiscounted future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover an asset’s carrying amount, the asset is written down to its fair value. Assets to be disposed of by sale, if any, are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
Accounting for Restricted Stock Awards
The Company uses restricted stock awards to attract, retain and reward employees for long-term service. The Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718 “Compensation - Stock Compensation” which requires that the compensation cost relating to stock-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements. This compensation cost is measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. The Company measures stock-based compensation cost using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for stock options and the fair value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant for restricted stock awards.
Insurance Liabilities
The Company has risk participation arrangements with respect to workers compensation and health care insurance. The Company establishes loss provisions based on historical experience and in the case of expected losses from workers compensation, considers input from third parties. The amounts included in the Company’s costs related to this risk participation are estimated and can vary based on changes in assumptions, the Company’s claims experience or the providers included in the associated insurance programs.
Accounting for Income Taxes
In establishing the provision for income taxes and deferred income tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the Company makes judgments and interpretations based on enacted tax laws, published tax guidance and estimates of future earnings. As of January 2, 2021, the Company had both domestic and foreign net deferred tax assets of $2.9 million. The domestic long term net deferred tax assets of $3.3 million includes $4.9 million in deferred assets offset by $1.6 million in deferred tax liabilities. The domestic deferred tax assets consist of a net operating loss carryforward of $2.6 million and various deferred expense accruals and reserves of $2.3 million. The deferred tax liabilities consist of acquisition amortization of $0.7 million, prepaid expenses of $0.6 million and advance depreciation deductions of $0.3 million. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the likelihood that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize these benefits over time, and the effectiveness of tax planning strategies in the relevant tax jurisdictions. If actual results differ from these estimates and assessments, valuation allowances may be required. The Company also had $0.4 million in foreign net deferred tax liabilities as of January 2, 2021.
The Company conducts its operations in multiple tax jurisdictions in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and Serbia. The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated United States Federal income tax return and file in various states. The Company’s federal income tax returns have been examined through 2017. The Company has no open Federal audits as of January 2, 2021. The State of New Jersey is currently examining fiscal tax years 2009 through 2012. Except for New Jersey and other limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to audits by state and local tax authorities for tax years prior to 2017. The Company is no longer subject to audit in Canada for the tax years prior to tax year 2016. The Company is no longer subject to audit in Puerto Rico for the tax years prior to tax year 2010.
The Company’s future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of its deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof. In addition, the Company is subject to the examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes.
ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

Accrued Bonuses
The Company pays bonuses to certain executive management, field management and corporate employees based on, or after giving consideration to, a variety of financial performance measures. Bonuses for executive management, field management and certain corporate employees are accrued throughout the year for payment during the first quarter of the following year, based in part upon anticipated annual results compared to annual budgets. In addition, the Company pays discretionary bonuses to certain employees, which are not related to budget performance. Variances in actual results versus budgeted amounts can have a significant impact on the calculations and therefore on the estimates of the required accruals. Accordingly, the actual earned bonuses may be materially different from the estimates used to determine the quarterly accruals.
Performance-Based Restricted Stock Awards
From time-to-time the Company issues performance-based restricted stock awards to its executives. Performance-based restricted stock awards are typically vested based on certain multi-year performance metrics as determined by the Board of Directors Compensation Committee. The Company will reassess at each reporting date whether achievement of any performance condition is probable and would begin recognizing additional compensation cost if and when achievement of the performance condition becomes probable. The Company will then recognize the appropriate expense cumulatively in the year performance becomes probable and recognize the remaining compensation cost over the remaining requisite service period. If at a later measurement date the Company determines that performance-based restricted stock awards deemed as likely to vest are deemed as unlikely to vest, the expense recognized will be reversed. These performance-based restricted stock awards typically include dividend accrual equivalents, which means that any dividends paid by the Company during the vesting period become due and payable after the vesting period on any stock awards that actually vest, if any. Dividends for these grants are accrued on the dividend payment dates and included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Dividends for performance-based restricted stock awards that ultimately do not vest are forfeited.
Forward-looking Information
The Company’s growth prospects are influenced by broad economic trends. The pace of customer capital spending programs, new product launches and similar activities have a direct impact on the need for engineering and information technology services. When the U.S., Canadian or global economies decline, the Company’s operating performance could be adversely impacted. In addition, global events such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic also have a substantial impact on our operations and financial results. The Company believes that its fiscal discipline, strategic focus on targeted vertical markets and diversification of service offerings provides some insulation from adverse trends. However, general economic declines could result in the need for future cost reductions or changes in strategy.
Additionally, changes in government regulations could result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of new or additional employee benefits, licensing or tax requirements with respect to the provision of employment services that may reduce the Company’s future earnings. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase the fees charged to its clients in a timely manner and in a sufficient amount to cover increased costs as a result of any of the foregoing.
The consulting and employment services market is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry. The Company competes in global, national, regional and local markets with numerous competitors in all of the Company’s service lines. Price competition in the industries the Company serves is significant, and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing. The Company expects that the level of competition will remain high in the future, which could limit the Company’s ability to maintain or increase its market share or profitability.

The Company follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar ending on the Saturday closest to December 31. The fiscal years ended January 2, 2021 (fiscal 2020) and December 28, 2019 (fiscal 2019) consisted of fifty-three weeks and fifty-two weeks, respectively.
Revenue. Revenue decreased 21.3%, or $40.7 million, for the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 as compared to the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 (the “comparable prior year period”). Revenue decreased $10.1 million in the Engineering segment, $28.9 million in the Specialty Health Care segment and $1.7 million in the Information Technology segment. See Segment Discussion for further information on revenue changes.
Cost of Services and Gross Profit. Cost of services decreased 21.7%, or $31.0 million, for the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 as compared to the comparable prior year period. Cost of services decreased primarily due to the decrease in revenue. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue for the fifty-three week periods ended January 2, 2021 and the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 were 74.2% and 74.6%, respectively. See Segment Discussion for further information regarding changes in cost of services and gross profit.

Fiscal Year Ended January 2, 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 28, 2019
Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative (“SGA”) expenses were $37.6 million for the fifty-three week periods ended January 2, 2021 as compared to $40.4 million for the comparable prior year period. As a percentage of revenue, SGA expenses were 25.0% for the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 and 21.1% for the comparable prior year period. See Segment Discussion for further information on SGA expense changes.
Write-off of receivables and professional fees incurred related to arbitration. The Company recorded a charge of $8.4 million during the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 relating to its dispute with a customer that is a major utility in the United States. This dispute was resolved through binding arbitration April 2020. The charge consisted of $6.7 million for the portion of accounts receivable previously recognized by the Company that was not awarded by the arbitrator, $0.7 million from other projects with this customer that were not part of the arbitration, $0.8 million in professional fees related to the dispute and arbitration and $0.2 million of transit accounts receivable associated with disputed projects that were part of the arbitration. The Company decided to write off the $0.7 million of accounts receivable from other projects not part of the arbitration for business reasons. For the fifty-two week period December 28, 2019, there were no such impairment charges.
Impairment of Office Leases. In connection with the continuing developments from COVID-19, the Company has reduced its leased office space as a result of its employees moving to a remote work environment. The Company does not believe there is an opportunity to sublet any of the vacant office space due to the current commercial rental marketplace. This decision and reduction in the use of the office spaces resulted in a right-of-use asset impairment of $1.9 million. This loss was determined by identifying the fair value of the impacted right-of-use assets as compared to the carrying value of the assets as of the measurement date, in accordance with Property, Plant and Equipment Topic of the FASB ASC. The fair value of the right-of-use assets was based on the remaining term of each lease. In addition, the Company wrote off a total of $0.3 million in other office lease costs and for obsolete equipment.
Tax Credit Professional Fees. The Company incurred $0.2 million in tax credit professional fees in the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 as compared to de minimis tax credit professional fees in the comparable prior year period.
Other Expense. Other expense consists of interest expense, unused line fees and amortized loan costs on the Company’s line of credit, net of interest income, imputed interest on contingent consideration and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions. Other expense, net decreased to $1.1 million as compared to $1.7 million for the comparable prior year period. The primary component of the decrease related to interest expense, which decreased primarily due to a decreased average borrowing and a decreased borrowing rate under the Company’s line of credit. The primary reason for the decreased average borrowing rate was change in macroeconomic borrowing rates.
Income Tax (Benefit) Expense. The Company recognized $3.2 million of income tax benefit for the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021, as compared to an income tax expense of $0.8 million for the comparable prior year period. The consolidated effective income tax rate for the current period was 26.4% as compared to 15.8% for the comparable prior year period. The Company considers its fiscal 2020 effective tax rate within the range of typical expectations, while its 2019 effective tax rate is comparatively low. The primary reason for the lower 2019 effective tax rate is that the Company experienced an R&D tax credit of $0.7 million. The effective fiscal 2020 income tax rates for the fifty-three weeks ended January 2, 2021, were 25.8%, 25.6%, and 15.8% in the United States, Canada, and Serbia, respectively. The relative income or loss generated in each jurisdiction can materially impact the overall effective income tax rate of the Company, particularly the ratio of Canadian and Serbian pretax income versus U.S. pretax income.
Differences between the effective tax rate and the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate may arise, primarily from the effect of state and local income taxes, share-based compensation, and potential tax credits available to the Company. Actual effective tax rates may vary depending on the actual operating income earned in various jurisdictions, the potential availability of tax credits, and the exercise of stock options and vesting of share-based awards.

Segment Discussion
Engineering
Engineering revenues of $57.7 million for the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 decreased 15.0%, or $10.1 million, as compared to the comparable prior year period. The decrease was due to decreases of $5.1 million from the Company’s Aerospace Group, $3.6 million from the Company’s Energy Services/Industrial Processing Groups and $1.5 million from the Company’s Canadian Power Systems Group. The Company attributes these revenue declines to decreased spending on the part of several of its larger clients, a decrease in demand for power generation services, increased competition from other vendors to its Canadian Power Systems and Aerospace clients, timing of large projects from the Company’s Energy Services clients, all of which factors are impacted by COVID-19. Gross profit decreased by 10.8%, or $2.0 million, as compared to the comparable prior year period. Gross profit decreased primarily because of the decrease in revenue, offset by improvement to gross profit margin. Gross profit margin of 28.6% for the current period increased from 27.2% for the comparable prior year period. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to a concerted effort to improve utilization of the Engineering segment’s billable consultants and a focus on higher-margin project work as opposed to lower-margin staffing. The Engineering segment experienced an operating loss of $5.8 million for the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021, as compared to operating income of $3.7 million for the comparable prior year period. The primary reason for the operating loss in the current period was the $8.4 million write-off of receivables and professional fees incurred related to a discrete arbitration, offset by a decrease of $0.7 million to SGA expense. The decrease in SGA expense was primarily due to a concerted effort to reduce expenses to an efficient level commensurate with current revenue and gross profit.
COVID-19 Impact to Engineering Segment
It is difficult to assess both the current and future impact from COVID-19 to the Engineering segment, due to the high degree of uncertainty around COVID-19 and the duration and extent of the pandemic. The Engineering segment has seen a decline in its field services work as its personnel has limited access to client facilities. It is difficult to determine the impact on revenue from the loss in field services work. The Company believes that an undetermined amount of field services work will eventually return as a portion of that work is mission-critical to our clients. However, given the uncertainties around COVID-19, the Company can give no assurances that it will see an increase in field services revenue. Additionally, the Company believes that COVID-19 has had a significant adverse impact on the budgets of many of its Aerospace and Utilities clients. Many of the Company’s Aerospace clients have seen an impact to their commercial lines of business. A number of the Company’s Utility clients have been impacted by their customers’ inability to pay their monthly electric bills.
The Company has transitioned most of its Engineering workforce to work from home. While this has constituted a significant effort, particularly from a technology standpoint, the Company believes that this effort has been completed relatively effectively. The Company also believes that its Engineering clients have been generally supportive of these efforts and believes further that it has not lost any significant, previously awarded work. The Engineering segment continues to see new work proposals, but not at the same level as seen prior to COVID-19. The Engineering segment’s general response to the effects of COVID-19 is to continue to focus on maximizing gross margin by focusing on utilization of billable consultants and maximizing the efficiency of its SGA expense. The Engineering segment and the Company, as a whole, is focused on reducing its SGA expense in the short-term while not harming the Company in the long-term. The Company plans to refine its strategy for responding to COVID-19 as necessary as the situation develops.

Specialty Health Care
Specialty Health Care revenue of $60.5 million for the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 decreased 32.3%, or $28.9 million, as compared to the comparable prior year period. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by school closures related to COVID-19 (see below). The Specialty Health Care segment’s gross profit decreased by 36.0%, or $7.5 million, to $13.4 million for the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021, as compared to $20.9 million for the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by a decrease in revenue and a decrease in gross profit margin. Gross profit margin for the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 decreased to 22.1% as compared to 23.4% for the comparable prior year period. The Company primarily attributes the decrease in gross profit margin to a shift in mix, as the Specialty Health Care’s non-school services typically generate lower gross margin than school services. Specialty Health Care experienced an operating loss of $2.5 million for the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021, as compared to operating income of $2.9 million for the comparable prior year period. The primary reason for the decrease in operating income was the decrease to revenue, gross profit, and gross profit margin, primarily resulting from sudden school closures (see below). SGA expense decreased by $2.1 million to $15.5 million, as compared to $17.6 million in the comparable prior year period. The decrease in SGA expense was primarily due to a concerted effort to reduce SGA expense in response to the impact of COVID-19 on school services revenue, a decrease in variable SGA expense related to gross profit, and a lower allocation of corporate-generated SGA expense.
COVID-19 Impact to Specialty Health Care Segment
It is difficult to assess both the current and future impact from COVID-19 to the Specialty Health Care segment, due to the high degree of uncertainty around COVID-19 and the duration and extent of the pandemic, especially as it may impact schools where many of our personnel work. While the Company has worked to transition a portion of its Specialty Health Care workforce to work from home, this has been a difficult task. The Specialty Health Care segment has a small number of billable professionals performing services from home, in particular telehealth services. The Specialty Health Care segment’s telehealth services are primarily a new service offering. The majority of the Specialty Health Care segment’s services are historically delivered at schools and health care facilities. The Company believes that demand for much of its non-school services is very high as a result of COVID-19. However, health care professionals, such as nurses and doctors, are scarce and difficult to recruit. Furthermore, the demand for non-COVID-19 related healthcare services has been reduced as a result of the pandemic.
The Specialty Health Care Segment has historically derived much of its revenue from school systems. Many school systems nationwide, including most of the Company’s school clients, closed down for in-person instruction in March 2020. Some have reopened partially with a combination of in-person and virtual lessons, while some have remained entirely virtual. The Company has limited information on when, and in what manner, they will reopen in a comparable manner as to how they operated before COVID-19. Many schools are under pressure by employee unions to reduce or eliminate in-person classes. Any announced plans are subject to rapid changes.
The Specialty Health Care's largest school clients are the New York City Department of Education, the Hawaii Department of Education, and the Chicago Public School System. There are numerous factors that could influence further decisions of these school systems on their operations. Any shift toward hybrid and remote operations has a materially negative impact on revenue generated by the Specialty Healthcare segment.
The Specialty Health Care segment generated $37.3 million in revenue from schools for the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021, as compared to $65.6 million for the comparable prior year period. It is difficult to estimate the impact of the school closures and reopenings on the Company’s fiscal 2021 and beyond. The Company believes that at some point in the future, its school clients will return to a normalized level of operations. However, the Company can give no assurance of when or even if this normalization will occur.

Segment Discussion (Continued)
The Specialty Health Care segment continues to see new work proposals related to non-school related revenue streams. The Specialty Health Care segment’s general response to the effects of COVID-19 is to continue to focus on maximizing gross margin by focusing on utilization of billable personnel and maximizing the efficiency of its SGA expense. The Specialty Health Care segment has made significant reductions to its SGA cost structure. The Specialty Health Care segment and the Company, as a whole, are focused on reducing SGA expense in the short-term while not harming the Company in the long-term. The Company plans to refine its strategy for responding to COVID-19 as necessary as the situation develops.
Information Technology
Information Technology revenue of $32.2 million for the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 decreased 4.9%, or $1.7 million, as compared to $33.9 million for the comparable prior year period. The Information Technology segment’s revenue declined across most of its lines of business. The Company generally attributes the decrease to the impact of COVID-19 as its runoff of backlog has not been adequately replaced with new business. Gross profit of $9.0 million for the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 decreased 2.4%, or $0.2 million, as compared to $9.2 million for the comparable prior year period. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the decrease in revenue, partially offset by an increase in gross profit margin. The Information Technology gross profit margin for the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 was 27.9% as compared to 27.2% for the comparable prior year period. The Company attributes the gross profit margin increase to higher utilization of the Information Technology’s fixed labor consultants and a concerted effort to increase gross profit margin. SGA expense was $9.1 million for both periods presented. The Information Technology segment experienced an operating loss of $0.2 million as compared to a small amount of operating income for the comparable prior year period. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the decrease in revenue and gross profit.
It is difficult to assess both the current and future impact from COVID-19 to the Information Technology segment, due to the high degree of uncertainty around COVID-19 and the duration and extent of the pandemic. The Information Technology segment has seen a decline in its field services work as its personnel has limited access to client facilities. It is difficult to determine the impact on revenue from the loss in field services work.
COVID-19 Impact to Information Technology Segment
The Company has transitioned most of its Information Technology workforce to work from home. While this has constituted a significant effort, particularly from a technology standpoint, the Company believes that this effort has been completed relatively effectively. The Company also believes that its Information Technology clients have been generally supportive of these efforts and believes further that it has not lost any significant, previously awarded work. The Information Technology segment continues to see new work proposals, but not at the same level as seen prior to COVID-19. The Information Technology segment’s general response to the effects of COVID-19 is to continue to focus on maximizing gross margin by focusing on utilization of billable consultants and maximizing the efficiency of its SGA expense. The Information Technology segment and the Company, as a whole, is focused on reducing its SGA expense in the short-term while not harming the Company in the long-term.

Supplemental Operating Results on a Non-GAAP Basis
The following non-GAAP measures, which adjust for the categories of expenses described below, primarily changes in contingent consideration as a result of re-measurement in the amount of contingent consideration we expect to pay with respect to past acquisitions, are non-GAAP financial measures. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures (“EBITDA” and “Adjusted EBITDA”) are useful information for investors, shareholders and other stakeholders of our company in gauging our results of operations on an ongoing basis and to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our current financial performance and period-to-period comparisons. We believe that both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are performance measures and not liquidity measures, and therefore a reconciliation between net income and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA has been provided. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA should be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of performance. In addition, neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA takes into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes that can affect cash flows. We do not intend the presentation of these non-GAAP measures to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The following unaudited table presents the Company's GAAP Net Income measure and the corresponding adjustments used to calculate “EBITDA” and “Adjusted EBITDA” for the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 and the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019.

Operating Activities
Operating activities provided $25.2 million of cash for the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 as compared to using $4.8 million in the comparable prior year period. The major components of cash used in or provided by operating activities in the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 and the comparable prior year period are as follows: net loss or income and changes in accounts receivable, the net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses and accrued payroll and related costs.
For the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021, the Company experienced a net loss of $8.9 million as compared to net income of $4.1 million for the comparable prior year period. A decrease in accounts receivables in the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021, exclusive of the impact of the arbitration resolution, provided $15.9 million of cash as compared to using $7.6 million in the comparable prior year period. The Company primarily attributes this decrease in accounts receivables for the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 to the decrease in revenue for the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 as compared to the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 and the collection of the arbitration award.
The Company’s transit accounts payable usually exceeds the Company’s transit accounts receivable, but absolute amounts and differences fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the normal course of business. The net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable was a net payable of $2.4 million as of January 2, 2021 and as compared to a net receivable of $0.3 million as of December 28, 2019, providing $2.7 million of cash during the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021. The net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable was negligible as of December 29, 2018, using $0.3 million of cash during the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019.
Prepaid expenses and other current assets used cash of $0.2 million for the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 as compared to using $0.6 million of cash for the comparable prior year period. The Company attributes changes to prepaid expenses and other current assets, if any, to general timing of payments in the normal course of business.
An increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses provided cash of $1.6 million for the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 as compared to using $3.1 million of cash for the comparable prior year period. The Company attributes these changes to a deliberate effort to defer payments for cash flow purposes and general timing of payments to vendors in the normal course of business. Additionally, the Company accrued $1.7 million for the settlement of a class action suit in California that alleges the Company did not properly pay its travel nurses overtime wages. The Company anticipates this liability will be paid during its fiscal 2021 third quarter.

Operating Activities (Continued)
Changes in accrued payroll and related costs provided $4.6 million for the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 as compared to using $1.3 million for the fifty-three week period December 28, 2019. There are four primary factors that generally impact accrued payroll and related costs: 1) there is a general correlation to operating expenses as payroll and related costs is the Company’s largest expense group, so as operating costs increase or decrease, absent all other factors, so will the accrued payroll and related costs; 2) the Company pays the majority of its payroll every two weeks and normally has thirteen weeks in a fiscal quarter, which means that the Company normally has a major payroll on the last business day of every other quarter; 3) the timing of various payroll related payments varies in the normal course of business; and 4) most of the Company’s senior management participate in annual incentive plans and while progress advances are sometimes made during the fiscal year, these accrued bonus balances, to the extent they are projected to be achieved, generally accumulate throughout the year. A significant portion of these incentive plan accruals are typically paid at the beginning of one fiscal year, pertaining to the prior fiscal year. The Company’s last major payroll for the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 was paid on December 31, 2020. Unique to fiscal 2020 and the primary reason for the increase in accrued payroll and related costs, as of January 2, 2021, the Company also deferred $3.3 million of employer payroll taxes under the CARES Act. These deferred payroll taxes must be paid in two equal installments at the end of calendar years 2021 and 2022.
Investing Activities
Investing activities used cash of $0.4 million for both the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 and the fifty-two week period December 28, 2019. Investing activities primarily consists of expenditures for property and equipment in both periods presented.
Financing Activities
Financing activities used $25.6 million of cash for the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 as compared to providing $6.7 million in the comparable prior year period. The Company made net repayments under its line of credit of $22.9 million during the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 as compared to net borrowings of $7.2 million in the comparable prior year period. The primary reasons for net payments during the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 was the decrease of $15.9 million in accounts receivable and the $9.3 million in net cash provided by all other operating activities. The Company generated cash of $0.2 million and $0.3 million from sales of shares from its equity plans for the current period and the comparable prior year period, respectively. The Company also used $2.2 million to retire a note payable incurred to repurchase the Company’s common stock. The Company paid $0.3 million of contingent consideration during the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 and $0.6 million during the fifty-two week period December 28, 2019.
Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at one of two alternative rates, as selected by the Company at each incremental borrowing. These alternatives are: (i) LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), plus applicable margin, typically borrowed in fixed 30-day increments or (ii) the agent bank’s prime rate generally borrowed over shorter durations. The Company also pays unused line fees based on the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn. Unused line fees are recorded as interest expense. The effective weighted average interest rate, including unused line fees, for the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021 was 2.7%.

Financing Activities (Continued)
All borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are collateralized by all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and a pledge of the stock of its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains various financial and non-financial covenants, such as a covenant that restricts on the Company’s ability to borrow in order to pay dividends. As of January 2, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility (as amended). The Company believes that it will maintain compliance with its financial covenants for the foreseeable future.
Borrowings under the line of credit as of January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019 were $11.9 million and $34.8 million, respectively. At January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019 there were letters of credit outstanding for $1.9 million and $1.6 million, respectively. At January 2, 2021, the Company had availability for additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of $31.2 million.
On June 2, 2020, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with certain stockholders of the Company, whereby the Company purchased an aggregate of 1,858,139 shares of the Company’s common stock for a negotiated purchase price of $1.20 per share or $2.2 million in total. The negotiated price of $1.20 per share was less than the lowest trading price of the stock on the day of the repurchase. The consideration paid by the Company consisted entirely of an unsecured subordinated promissory note for $2.2 million. The note accrues interest at an annual rate of 9.0%, compounded annually, payable quarterly in arrears commencing on September 1, 2020 and continuing on each December 1, March 1, June 1 and September 1 thereafter, and has a maturity date of August 10, 2023. Subject to the applicable provisions of the subordination agreement among the Company, Citizens Bank and the selling stockholders, the note was to become immediately due and payable in the event of a default by the Company. On September 25, 2020, the Company repaid the subordinated promissory note in full.
Impact to Line of Credit from COVID-19
The Company is negatively impacted by COVID-19. While COVID-19 is expected to continue to negatively impact revenue, gross profit, and operating income for an undetermined period of time, the Company nevertheless does not expect a material negative impact from recent results. If the Company should experience a sudden increase to revenue and a corresponding increase to accounts receivable, the Company will likely experience negative cash flow. In this scenario, the Company would expect to see an increase in operating income and borrowing capacity. As a response to COVID-19, the Company, as a whole, is focused on maximizing the utilization of its billable personnel and reducing its SGA expense in the short-term while not harming the Company in the long-term. The Company plans to refine its strategy for responding to COVID-19 as the situation develops. The Company believes that its current line of credit is adequate to provide the necessary liquidity while COVID-19 impacts its operations. The Company believes that it will be in compliance with the financial covenants in the line of credit for the foreseeable future.
Current Liquidity and Revolving Credit Facility
Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, maintain our assets, fund our operations, and meet the other general cash needs of our business. Our liquidity is impacted by general economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay our expenses, principally labor-costs, and other related expenditures. We generally satisfy our liquidity needs through cash provided by operations and, when necessary, our revolving line of credit from Citizens Bank. The Company believes it has a great deal of flexibility to reduce its costs if it becomes necessary. The Company believes that it can satisfy its liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months.

Current Liquidity and Revolving Credit Facility (Continued)
The Company’s liquidity and capital resources as of January 2, 2021, included accounts receivable and total current asset balances of $36.0 million and $43.9 million, respectively. Current liabilities were $28.0 million as of January 2, 2021 and were exceeded by total current assets by $15.9 million.
The Company experiences volatility in its daily cash flow and, at times, relies on the revolving line of credit to provide daily liquidity for the Company’s financial operations. As of January 2, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company believes that it will maintain compliance with its financial covenants for the foreseeable future.
Dividends
All restricted share awards contain a dividend equivalent provision entitling holders to dividends paid between the restricted stock unit grant date and ultimate share distribution date. As of January 2, 2021, there were no accrued dividends.
While the Company, at this time, has no plans to issue any future dividends, any future payment of dividends will depend upon, among other things, the Company’s earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, contractual restrictions, and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. The Revolving Credit Facility (as discussed above) prohibits the payment of any dividends or distributions on account of the Company’s capital stock without the prior consent of the majority of the Company’s lenders.
Commitments and Contingencies
The Company anticipates that its primary uses of capital in future periods will be for working capital purposes. Funding for any long-term and short-term capital requirements as well as future acquisitions will be derived from one or more of the Revolving Credit Facility (or a replacement thereof), funds generated through operations or future financing transactions. The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business, which may or may not be covered by insurance. Were an unfavorable final outcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity, and the results of operations.
The Company’s business strategy is to achieve growth both internally through operations and externally through strategic acquisitions. The Company from time to time engages in discussions with potential acquisition candidates. The Company has acquired numerous companies throughout its history and those acquisitions have generally included significant future contingent consideration. As the size of the Company and its financial resources increase however, acquisition opportunities requiring significant commitments of capital may arise. In order to pursue such opportunities, the Company may be required to incur debt or issue potentially dilutive securities in the future. No assurance can be given as to the Company’s future acquisition and expansion opportunities or how such opportunities will be financed.
The Company has reserved $1.7 million for the settlement of a class action suit in California that alleges the Company did not properly pay its travel nurses overtime wages. While the Company believes it did not violate any overtime wage laws, it nevertheless decided to settle this class action lawsuit in December 2020. The Company expects to pay the $1.7 million settlement sometime during its third quarter of fiscal 2021. The Company is exposed to other asserted claims as of January 2, 2021, but the Company does not believe any of these other claims have a probability of loss. As of January 2, 2021, the Company did not have an accrual for any such other claims. Furthermore, even if any of these other claims do result in an unfavorable outcome or settlement, the Company believes that such matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

The Company had a dispute with a customer that is a major utility in the United States. Both parties agreed in fiscal 2017 to resolve this dispute through binding arbitration. Arbitration hearings with this customer started in fiscal 2018. Essentially, the customer did not pay the balance of accounts receivable the Company believes were owed for certain disputed projects. As of December 28, 2019, the total amount of recorded receivables from this customer on these disputed projects was $14.1 million. Additionally, as part of the arbitration process, the customer asserted counter-claims of $10.3 million. The arbitrator rendered a decision in this dispute in April 2020, awarding the Company $7.4 million, and the arbitration award was paid during the thirteen week period ended September 26, 2020. The counter-claims asserted against the Company of $10.3 million were denied in their entirety. For the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021, the Company recorded a charge of $8.4 million, including $6.7 million constituting the portion of the accounts receivable relating to the disputed projects that was not awarded by the arbitrator, $0.7 million from other projects with this customer that were not part of the arbitration, $0.8 million in professional fees related to the dispute and arbitration, and $0.2 million of transit accounts receivable associated with disputed projects that were part of the arbitration. The Company decided to write off the $0.7 million of accounts receivable from other projects not part of the arbitration for business reasons.
The Company utilizes SAP software for its financial reporting and accounting system which was implemented in 1999 and has not undergone significant upgrades since its initial implementation. The Company believes that it will become necessary to upgrade or replace its SAP financial reporting and accounting system. The Company has not determined when this contemplated replacement may be necessary. The Company estimates this upgrade or replacement of their financial reporting and accounting system will cost between $0.5 million and $1.0 million. These estimates are subject to material change.
The Company’s current commitments consist primarily of lease obligations for office space. The Company believes that its capital resources are sufficient to meet its present obligations and those to be incurred in the normal course of business for at least the next 12 months.
The Company leases office facilities and various equipment under non-cancelable leases expiring at various dates through November 2025. Certain leases are subject to escalation clauses based upon changes in various factors. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the Company in 2020. This led the Company to review the guidance in ASC 360-10 to determine if an impairment of a long lived asset had occurred. It was determined that a portion of the office space leased in a number of locations would not be utilized through the remaining lease term. An impairment of the right of use asset for the unused space of $2.2 million was recorded in 2020.

Future Contingent Payments
As of January 2, 2021, the Company had two active acquisition agreements whereby additional contingent consideration may be earned by the former shareholders: 1) effective October 1, 2017, the Company acquired all of the stock of PSR Engineering Solutions d.o.o. Beograd (Voždovac) (“PSR”) and 2) effective September 30, 2018 the Company acquired certain assets of Thermal Kinetics Engineering, PLLC and Thermal Kinetics Systems, LLC (together, “TKE”).

Estimates of future contingent payments are subject to significant judgment and actual payments may materially differ from estimates. Potential future contingent payments to be made to all active acquisitions after January 2, 2021 are capped at a cumulative maximum of $3.1 million. The Company estimates future contingent consideration payments based on forecasted performance and recorded the fair value of those expected payments as of January 2, 2021. During the fifty-three week period ended January 2, 2021, the Company measured the intangibles acquired at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Contingent consideration related to acquisitions are recorded at fair value (level 3) with changes in fair value recorded in other (expense) income, net.
Significant employment agreements are as follows:
Executive Severance Agreements
The Company is a party to Executive Severance Agreements (the “Executive Severance Agreements”) with Mr. Vizi, dated as of June 1, 2018, and Mr. Miller, dated as of February 28, 2014, which set forth the terms and conditions of certain payments to be made by the Company to the executive in the event, while employed by the Company, the executive experiences (a) a termination of employment unrelated to a “Change in Control” (as defined therein) or (b) there occurs a Change in Control and either (i) the executive’s employment is terminated for a reason related to the Change in Control or (ii) in the case of Mr. Miller, Mr. Miller the executive remains continuously employed with the Company for three months following the Change in Control.
Under the terms of the Executive Severance Agreement, if either (a) the executive is involuntarily terminated by the Company for any reason other than “Cause” (as defined therein), “Disability” (as defined therein) or death, or (b) the executive resigns for “Good Reason” (as defined therein), and, in each case, the termination is not a “Termination Related to a Change in Control” (as defined below), the executive will receive the following severance payments: (i) an amount equal to 1.5 times the sum of (a) the executive’s annual base salary as in effect immediately prior to the termination date (before taking into account any reduction that constitutes Good Reason) (“Annual Base Salary”) and (b) the highest annual bonus paid to the executive in any of the three fiscal years immediately preceding the executive’s termination date (“Bonus”), to be paid in installments over the twelve month period following the executive’s termination date; and (ii) for a period of eighteen months following the executive’s termination date, a monthly payment equal to the monthly COBRA premium that the executive is required to pay to continue medical, vision, and dental coverage, for himself and, where applicable, his spouse and eligible dependents.

Notwithstanding the above, if the executive has a termination as described above and can reasonably demonstrate that such termination would constitute a Termination Related to a Change in Control, and a Change in Control occurs within 120 days following the executive’s termination date, the executive will be entitled to receive the payments set forth below for a Termination Related to a Change in Control, less any amounts already paid to the executive, upon consummation of the Change in Control.
Under the terms of the Executive Severance Agreement, if a Change in Control occurs and (a) the executive experiences a Termination Related to a Change in Control on account of (i) an involuntary termination by the Company for any reason other than Cause, death, or Disability, (ii) an involuntary termination by the Company within a specified period of time following a Change in Control (12 months for Mr. Vizi and three months for Mr. Miller) on account of Disability or death, or (iii) a resignation by the executive with Good Reason; or (b) in the case of Mr. Miller, the executive resigns, with or without Good Reason, which results in a termination date that is the last day of the three month period following the Change in Control, then the executive will receive the following severance payments: (1) a lump sum payment equal to two times the sum of the executive’s (a) Annual Base Salary and (b) Bonus; and (2) a lump sum payment equal to 24 multiplied by the monthly COBRA premium cost, as in effect immediately prior to the executive’s termination date, for the executive to continue medical, dental and vision coverage, as applicable, in such Company plans for himself and, if applicable, his spouse and eligible dependents. Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Company shall establish an irrevocable rabbi trust and contribute to the rabbi trust the applicable amounts due under the Executive Severance Agreement. If Mr. Miller receives the Change in Control Payment following his resignation at the end of the three month period following the Change in Control, he will not be eligible to receive any severance payments under his Executive Severance Agreement.
Mr. Miller’s Executive Severance Agreement provides that if Mr. Miller remains continuously employed for three months following a Change in Control and is employed by the Company on the last day of such specified period, Mr. Miller will receive a lump sum payment equal to two times the sum of his (a) Annual Base Salary and (b) Bonus (the “Change in Control Payment”). If Mr. Miller receives the Change in Control Payment, he will not be eligible to receive any severance payments under his Executive Severance Agreement.
Mr. Saks, along with several other members of the Company’s senior management (not including Mr. Vizi and Mr. Miller), is covered by our Change in Control Plan for Selected Executive Management (the “CIC Plan”).
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
None.
Impact of Inflation
Consulting, staffing, and project services are generally priced based on mark-ups on prevailing rates of pay, and as a result are able to generally maintain their relationship to direct labor costs. Permanent placement services are priced as a function of salary levels of the job candidates.
The Company’s business is labor intensive; therefore, the Company has a high exposure to increasing health care benefit costs. The Company attempts to compensate for these escalating costs in its business cost models and customer pricing by passing along some of these increased health care benefit costs to its customers and employees, however, the Company has not been able to pass on all increases. The Company is continuing to review its options to further control these costs, which the Company does not believe are representative of general inflationary trends. Otherwise, inflation has not been a meaningful factor in the Company’s operations.
ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
New Accounting Standards
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). The new standard amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt securities. In February 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) and Leases (Topic 842) - Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 and Update to SEC Section on Effective Date Related to Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which amends the effective date of the original pronouncement for smaller reporting companies. ASU 2016-13 and its amendments will be effective for the Company for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company believes the adoption will modify the way the Company analyzes financial instruments, but it does not anticipate a material impact on results of operations. The Company is in the process of determining the effects the adoption will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This standard only applies to contracts and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform. This guidance provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to accounting guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease entities’ financial reporting burdens as the market transitions from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The Company may elect to apply the amendments prospectively through December 31, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
