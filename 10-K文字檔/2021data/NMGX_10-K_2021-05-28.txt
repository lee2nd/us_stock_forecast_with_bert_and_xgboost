Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.
The following is management’s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
OVERVIEW
Nano Magic develops, commercializes and markets consumer and industrial products powered by nanotechnology that solve everyday problems for customers in the optical, transportation, military, sports and safety industries. Our primary business is the formulation, marketing and sale of products powered by nanotechnology including the ULTRA CLARITY brand eyeglass cleaner, our defogging products and nanocoating products for glass and ceramics. We have historically sold our consumer products directly to opticians and ophthalmologists and small optical retailers and we will continue to do so, even as we are now working to expand our consumer sales by sales to big box retailers and e-commerce. We also develop and sell printable inks and pastes, thermal management materials, and graphene foils and windows. Our Innovation and Technology Center conducts development services for us and for government and private customers.
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) was first reported in Wuhan, China. Less than four months later, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Restrictions imposed by Federal, state and local governments during the pandemic affected operations of our business and those of our vendors and customers as well as logistics for shipping and receiving supplies and shipping our products.
Apart from the disruption affecting all manufacturing businesses, some of the raw materials and bottles used to produce our liquid products are used to produce hand sanitizer and other cleaning product that are in high demand and some of our raw materials and packaging were harder to find at several points during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, shortages did not continue, and we have been able to obtain adequate supply. The increased use of face masks and other personal protective equipment as a result of the pandemic has created additional demand for our antifog product. We cannot know whether, or for how long, this will continue.
Our principal operating segments coincide with the types of products to be sold. The Company’s two reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were (i) the Product segment and (ii) the Contract services segment.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following comparative analysis on results of operations was based primarily on the comparative consolidated financial statements, footnotes and related information for the periods identified below and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this report. The results discussed below are for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Comparison of Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Revenues
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, revenues consisted of the following:
For the year ended December 31, 2020, sales from the Product segment increased by $2,536,627, or 165%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Sales of all product categories were higher, but the largest increase was for anti-fog products that are in high demand as the COVID pandemic has had many more people wearing face masks and shields in many more places and for longer periods. How long this will continue is unknown. We continue to work to increase direct sales to consumers, especially using the internet, and to expand by placing products with pharmacies, big box stores and other retailer outlets.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenues of our Contract services segment decreased by $213,397 or 24% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This reflects completion of work under government contracts without new contracts to replace them. We have submitted proposals for funding of other projects and expect, in the ordinary course of business, that some of those proposals will be funded and new contracts will replace those that have been concluded.
Cost of revenues
Cost of revenues includes inventory costs, materials and supplies costs, internal labor and related benefits, subcontractor costs, depreciation, overhead and shipping and handling costs incurred including costs related to government and private contracts in our Contract services segment.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cost of revenues increased by $1,008,306, or 48%. These consisted of the following:
Gross profit and gross margin
For the year ended December 31, 2020, gross profit amounted to $1,638,826 as compared to $323,901 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $1,314,924, or 406%. The increase was due primarily to the sales increase as well as the product mix. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, gross margins were 34.4% and 13.3%, respectively.
Gross profit and gross margin by segment and totals are as follows:
* Gross margin is based on respective segments sales.
Operating expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2020, operating expenses increased by $1,076,488, or 79%. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, operating expenses consisted of the following:
● For the year ended December 31, 2020, selling and marketing expenses decreased by $37,674, or 56%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in marketing consultants as we increased our internal capacity, as reflected in the increase in salaries, wages and related benefits.
● For the year ended December 31, 2020, salaries, wages and related benefits increased by $545,048 or 151%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The change from 2019 reflects the increase in the number of employees to support increased product sales and the growth in the marketing and sales function.
● For the year ended December 31, 2020, research and development costs decreased by $11,723, or 17%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This is attributable to our focus on the move of our facilities to Michigan and the demand for anti-fog that left fewer resources and less time for research and development work.
● For the year ended December 31, 2020, professional fees increased by $496,347, or 160%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This was due, primarily, an increase in accounting fees, software consulting fees, and an increase in outside counsel costs related to the petition the Company filed to challenge the trading suspension.
● For the year ended December 31, 2020, general and administrative expenses increased by $217,990, or 40%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to an across-the-board increase in support costs associated with increased personnel and resources.
● For the year ended December 31, 2020, other expense (income) increased by ($133,500) as a result of the settlement of a dispute with a former employee.
Loss from operations
As a result of the factors described above, for the year ended December 31, 2020, loss from operations amounted to $792,196 as compared to a loss from operations of $1,031,083 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $238,887 or 23%.
Other income
For the year ended December 31, 2020, total other income amounted to $10,691 as compared to other income of $66,096 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $55,405, or 84%. Interest expense was relatively flat. Other income was down by $57,151 or 76% mostly due to one-time miscellaneous income in 2019.
Net loss
As a result of the foregoing, for the year ended December 31, 2020, our net (loss) amounted to ($781,055) as compared to a net loss of ($964,987) for the year ended December 31, 2019, a change of $183,931 or 19%.
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, net loss amounted to $(0.10) per common share (basic and diluted), and a net loss of $(0.22) per common share (basic and diluted), respectively.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Liquidity is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. We had a working capital balance of $628,572 and unrestricted cash of $288,134 as of December 31, 2020.
The following table sets forth a summary of changes in our working capital from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020:
The increase in current assets reflects higher pre-paid expenses and contract assets. The largest part of that increase was increased accounts receivable. The increase in current liabilities includes significant increases in the current portion of lease liabilities related to the new facilities in Michigan and current portion of notes payable. We continue to work to increase revenues and that can put pressure on working capital. In addition to the new Paycheck Protection Loan for our subsidiary Nano Magic LLC obtained in 2020, Applied Nanotech received a similar loan in 2021. Also in 2020, we entered into a factoring arrangement that is expected to provide working capital, especially with large customers that have payment terms longer than 30 days.
Net cash used in operating activities was $2,021,153 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to net cash used by operating activities of $878,668 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $1,142,485, or 130%.
● Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily reflected a net loss of $781,055, partially offset by the add-back of non-cash items totaling ($171,845), and ($1,068,253) changes in operating assets and liabilities.
Net cash used in investing activities was $430,302 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $11,361 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Additions in 2020 were mostly purchases of leasehold improvements, production equipment, furniture and office equipment associated with the new Michigan facility.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $2,522,788 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $810,332 for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received $2,421,719 in net proceeds from the sale of securities and received $105,000 in net proceeds from equipment loans and the bank loan under the Paycheck Protection Program, offset by repayments on loans.
