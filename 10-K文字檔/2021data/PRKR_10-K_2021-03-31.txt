Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
﻿
Executive Overview
﻿
We are in the business of innovating fundamental wireless technologies and products. We have designed and developed proprietary RF technologies and integrated circuits for use in wireless communication products. We have expended significant financial and other resources to research and develop our RF technologies and to obtain patent protection for those technologies in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. We believe certain patents protecting our proprietary technologies have been broadly infringed by others and therefore our business plan primarily consists of enforcement of our intellectual property rights through patent infringement litigation and licensing efforts. We currently have patent enforcement actions ongoing in various U.S. district courts against providers of mobile handsets, smart televisions and other WiFi products and, in certain cases, their chip suppliers for the infringement of a number of our RF patents. We have made significant investments in developing and protecting our technologies, the returns on which are dependent upon the generation of future revenues for realization.
﻿
In 2018, we restructured our operations to reduce operating expenses. As part of that restructuring, we made significant reductions in our investment in the development and marketing of a consumer distributed WiFi product line marketed under the brand name Milo®. Our cost reduction measures
			
		
			
		
included the closure of our engineering design center in Lake Mary, Florida and a reduction in executive and management salaries. In early 2019, we ceased substantially all ongoing research and development efforts and, where applicable, repurposed resources to support our patent enforcement and product sales and support efforts. We ceased sales of our Milo products in the fourth quarter of 2019 and are currently focused exclusively on our patent enforcement litigation and licensing efforts.
﻿
We continue to aggressively pursue licensing opportunities with wireless communications companies that make, use or sell chipsets and/or products that incorporate RF. We believe there are a number of wireless communications companies that can benefit from the use of the RF technologies we have developed, whether through a license or, in certain cases, a joint product venture that may include licensing rights. Our licensing efforts to date have required litigation in order to enforce and/or defend our intellectual property rights. Since 2011, we have been involved in patent infringement litigation against Qualcomm and others for the unauthorized use of our technology. Refer to Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for a complete discussion of our legal proceedings. We have expended significant resources since 2011 and incurred significant debt for the enforcement and defense of our intellectual property rights.
﻿
Recent Developments
﻿
Equity and Debt Financings
In January 2021, we received aggregate proceeds of approximately $1.0 million from the sale of common stock to accredited investors at a price of $0.35 per share. The securities purchase agreements include contingent payment rights identical to the unsecured contingent payment obligations incurred in 2020 (see “Contingent Payment Obligations” included under Financial Condition). Approximately $0.4 million in proceeds for this transaction was received as of December 31, 2020 and recorded as an accrued liability until the consummation of the transaction. We entered into registration rights agreements with the investors pursuant to which we will register the shares. We have committed to file the registration statement by April 15, 2021 and to cause the registration statement to become effective by June 30, 2021. The registration rights agreements provide for liquidated damages upon the occurrence of certain events including failure by us to file the registration statement or cause it to become effective by the deadlines set forth above. The amount of the liquidated damages is 1.0% of the aggregate subscription upon the occurrence of the event, and monthly thereafter, up to a maximum of 6%, or approximately $0.06 million.
In March 2021, we received aggregate proceeds of approximately $4.2 million from the sale of common stock and warrants to accredited investors at a price of $1.29 per share of common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $1.75 and expire in March 2026. We entered into registration rights agreements with the investors pursuant to which we will register the shares. We have committed to file the registration statement within 30 days and to cause the registration statement to become effective within 90 days. The registration rights agreements provide for liquidated damages upon the occurrence of certain events including failure by us to file the registration statement or cause it to become effective by the deadlines set forth above. The amount of the liquidated damages is 1.0% of the aggregate subscription upon the occurrence of the event, and monthly thereafter, up to a maximum of 6%, or approximately $0.25 million. The majority of the proceeds from this transaction were used to satisfy our obligations to Mintz (see “Mintz Agreement” below).
﻿
Share Based Compensation Arrangements
On January 11, 2021, the Board amended the 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2019 Plan from 12 million to 27 million shares.
The Board also approved grants, under the 2019 Plan, of two-year options, with an exercise price of $0.54 per share, vesting in 8 equal quarterly installments commencing on March 31, 2021 and expiring on
			
		
			
		
January 11, 2026. The grants under the 2019 Plan included an option to purchase 8,000,000 shares granted to Jeffrey Parker, an option to purchase 1,000,000 shares granted to Cynthia French, an option to purchase 380,000 shares to each of the three non-employee directors, and options to purchase an aggregate of 2,900,000 shares granted to other key employees.
﻿
On January 25, 2021, we amended our business consulting and retention agreement with Chelsea to increase the compensation for services over the remaining term and to extend the term of the agreement through February 2024. As consideration for the amended agreement, we issued 500,000 shares of unregistered common stock in exchange for a nonrefundable retainer for services valued at approximately $0.33 million. The value of the stock issued is being recognized as consulting expense over the term of the agreement.
﻿
On March 9, 2021, we granted approximately 32,000 shares under our 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan to a consultant for business communications services over a one-year term valued at approximately $0.05 million.
﻿
Warrant and Option Exercises
During the three months ended March 31, 2021, we received aggregate proceeds of $0. 4 million from the exercise of outstanding options and warrants at an average exercise price of $0.16 per share.
﻿
Mintz Agreement
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $3.1 million in accounts payable to Mintz and an outstanding balance of approximately $0.03 million on a secured note payable to Mintz for legal fees and expenses. In addition, we had approximately $3.6 million in disputed legal fees and expenses billed by Mintz that we treated as a loss contingency that was not probable as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and accordingly, for which we recognized no expense in the consolidated financial statements. In March 2021, we entered into an agreement with Mintz to satisfy our outstanding obligations and reduce any future contingency fees payable to Mintz. On March 29, 2021, we paid Mintz a lump-sum payment of $3.0 million in satisfaction of our outstanding obligations to Mintz including the Mintz note, our accounts payable to Mintz, and all disputed and unrecorded billings. Mintz waived all past defaults on the Mintz note and agreed to a significant reduction in future success fees payable to Mintz from patent-related proceeds.
﻿
Legal Proceedings
On March 26, 2021, the district court in the Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division, issued an order that, among other things, postponed our trial date in ParkerVision v. Qualcomm citing backlog due to the pandemic as a factor. A new trial date has not yet been set but is unlikely to be scheduled prior to November or December 2021 according to the court.
﻿
Liquidity and Capital Resources
﻿
We have incurred significant losses from operations and negative cash flows in every year since inception, largely as a result of our significant investments in developing and protecting our intellectual property. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred a net loss of approximately $19.6 million and negative cash flows from operations of approximately $4.8 million. At December 31, 2020, we had a working capital deficit of approximately $3.8 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately $421.4 million. Our independent registered public accounting firm has included in their audit report an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern.
﻿
			
		
			
		
Our working capital deficit is primarily the result of approximately $4.1 million in accounts payable related to outstanding litigation fees and expenses. Our working capital improved by $1.7 million from 2019 to 2020, primarily as the result of the increase in our cash and cash equivalents from debt and equity financings. Our use of cash for operations increased 42%, from $3.4 million in 2019 to $4.8 million in 2020. This increase is primarily the result of increased legal expenses associated with our patent enforcement efforts. Our operations in 2020 were primarily funded through approximately $6.0 million in proceeds from debt and equity financings, as well as $1.6 million received from the exercise of warrants. Comparatively, we received net proceeds of approximately $3.1 million from debt financings in 2019. We used $1.3 million and $1.2 million in cash to repay outstanding debt obligations in 2020 and 2019, respectively. These debt repayments were primarily related to a secured note payable with Mintz which had an outstanding balance of $0.03 million at December 31, 2020 and was repaid in full in the first quarter of 2021.
﻿
At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $0.19 million in current debt obligations, including $0.07 million related to a Paycheck Protection Program loan, which we believe will be forgiven, based on the program criteria. This represents a decrease of $1.3 million from our current debt obligations at December 31, 2019. The decrease in our current debt repayment obligations is primarily the result of $1.2 million in repayments made on the Mintz note in 2020.
﻿
We had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.6 million at December 31, 2020. We received an additional $5.6 million in proceeds from debt and equity financings and warrant and option exercises in the first quarter of 2021, of which $3.0 million was used to settle outstanding accounts and notes payable for litigation costs. Our remaining capital resources will be used to fund our current obligations and ongoing operating costs; however these resources may not be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and we may be required to seek additional capital.
﻿
Our ability to meet our short-term liquidity needs, including our debt repayment obligations, is dependent upon one or more of (i) our ability to successfully negotiate licensing agreements and/or settlements relating to the use of our technologies by others in excess of our contingent payment obligations to Brickell and legal counsel; and/or (ii) our ability to raise additional capital from the sale of equity securities or other financing arrangements.
﻿
Significant portions of our litigation costs to date have been funded by contingent payment arrangements with legal counsel. Fee discounts offered by legal counsel in exchange for contingent payments upon successful outcome in our litigation are not recognized in expense until such time that the related proceeds on which the contingent fees are payable are considered probable. Contingent fees vary based on each firm’s specific fee agreement. We currently have contingent fee arrangements in place for all of our active cases.
﻿
In addition to contingent fee arrangements with legal counsel, we have a contingent repayment obligation to Brickell that was recorded at its estimated fair value of $33.1 million at December 31, 2020. Brickell is entitled to a priority, prorated payment of up to 100% of proceeds received by us from funded patent-related actions up to a specified minimum return. Brickell’s minimum return is determined as a multiple of the outstanding funded amount that increases over time. The estimated minimum return due to Brickell if repaid in full at December 31, 2020 is approximately $42 million, an increase of approximately $3 million, or 8%, from the minimum return that would have been due to Brickell as of December 31, 2019. In addition, in 2020 we incurred unsecured contingent payment obligations in connection with various financings. These unsecured contingent payment obligations are recorded at an aggregate estimated fair value of $5.2 million, with a maximum payment obligation of $9.7 million at December 31, 2020.
﻿
			
		
			
		
Although current working capital will not be used to repay our contingent arrangements, based on our current outstanding legal proceedings, funding arrangements and contingent payment arrangements, we estimate that up to 100% of our initial future proceeds will be used to repay contingent payment arrangements until Brickell’s minimum return has been met. After repayment of Brickell’s minimum return, we estimate that 45% to 65% of estimated future proceeds from current actions could be payable to others, depending on the proceeding and the nature, amount and timing of proceeds, among other factors.
﻿
Patent enforcement litigation is costly and time-consuming and the outcome is difficult to predict. We expect to continue to invest in the support of our patent enforcement and licensing programs. We expect that revenue generated from patent enforcement actions and/or technology licenses in 2021, if any, after deduction of payment obligations to Brickell and legal counsel, may not be sufficient to cover our operating expenses. In the event we do not generate revenues, or other patent-related proceeds, sufficient to cover our operational costs and contingent repayment obligation, we will be required to raise additional working capital through the sale of equity securities or other financing arrangements.
﻿
The long-term continuation of our business plan is dependent upon our ability to secure sufficient financing to support our business, and our ability to generate revenues and/or patent-related proceeds sufficient to offset expenses and meet our contingent payment obligation and other long-term debt repayment obligations. Failure to generate sufficient revenues, raise additional capital through debt or equity financings, and/or reduce operating costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our short and long-term liquidity needs and achieve our intended long-term business objectives.
﻿
Financial Condition
﻿
Intangible Assets
We consider our intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets to be significant to our business. Our intangible assets are pledged as security for our secured contingent payment obligation with Brickell and our secured note payable with our litigation counsel. The net book value of our intangible assets was approximately $2.2 million and $2.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, generally fifteen to twenty years. The decrease in the carrying value of our intangible assets is primarily the result of $0.4 million in patent amortization expense recognized in 2020 as our portfolio matures and a $0.3 million loss on abandonment of certain patents and patent applications. Management evaluates the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and takes into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that may indicate impairment exists. As part of our ongoing patent maintenance program, we may, from time to time, abandon a particular patent if we determine fees to maintain the patent exceed its expected recoverability. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred losses of approximately $0.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, for the write-off of specific patent assets. These losses are included in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.
﻿
Contingent Payment Obligations
We have a secured and unsecured contingent payment obligations recorded at an aggregate estimated fair value of $38.3 million and $26.7 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These repayment obligations are contingent upon receipt of proceeds from patent enforcement and other patent monetization actions. As a result, we have elected to account for these contingent payment obligations at their estimated fair values which are subject to significant estimates and assumptions as discussed in “Critical Accounting Policies” below. Refer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements
			
		
			
		
included in Item 8 for a discussion of the fair value measurement of our contingent payment obligation.
﻿
Our secured contingent payment obligation is payable to Brickell under a 2016 funding agreement, as amended from time to time. Brickell has a right to reimbursement and compensation from gross proceeds resulting from patent enforcement and other patent monetization actions on a priority basis. The amount of our obligation varies based on the magnitude, timing and nature of proceeds received by us.
﻿
In addition, in 2020, we incurred unsecured contingent payment obligations in connection with various funding arrangements. The contingent payment obligations are payable from our share of patent-related proceeds after satisfaction of our obligation to Brickell and payment of contingent fees to legal counsel.
﻿
The $11.6 million increase in estimated fair value of our contingent payment obligations from 2019 to 2020 is the result of $3.2 million in new unsecured payment obligations incurred and an $8.4 million increase in the estimated fair value of the contingent obligations. See “Change in Fair Value of Contingent Obligations” below for a discussion of the increase in fair value.
﻿
Notes Payable
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1.0 million in notes payable, including an unsecured promissory note payable to Sterne, Kessler, Goldstein, & Fox, PLLC (“SKGF”), a related party, of approximately $0.8 million, a secured promissory note payable to Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C. (“Mintz”) of $0.03 million, and a loan from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) of approximately $0.2 million. Failure to comply with the payment terms of each of these notes constitutes an event of default which, if uncured, will result in the entire unpaid principal balance of the note and any unpaid, accrued interest to become immediately due and payable. In addition, an event of default results in an increase in the interest rate under the SKGF and Mintz notes to a default rate of 12% per annum. We were in default on the payment provisions of the Mintz note since November 2019 and, accordingly, accrued interest at the default rate. In March 2021, we settled our outstanding obligations with Mintz (as more fully discussed in “Recent Developments”) and Mintz waived all past defaults on the note which has been paid in full. In addition, in March 2021, we started the application process for forgiveness of the PPP loan. Based on the PPP loan forgiveness criteria, we anticipate that we will qualify for forgiveness of the entire principal amount of this loan.
﻿
Deferred Tax Assets and Related Valuation Allowance
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when, based on available objective evidence, it is more likely than not that the benefit of such assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2020, we had net deferred tax assets of approximately $94 million, primarily related to our NOL carryforwards, which were fully offset by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty related to realization of these assets through future taxable income. In addition, our ability to benefit from our NOL and other tax credit carryforwards could be limited under Section 382 as more fully discussed in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.
﻿
Results of Operations for Each of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
﻿
Revenues and Gross Margins
﻿
We reported no licensing revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019. Although we do anticipate licensing revenue and/or settlement gains to result from our licensing and patent enforcement
			
		
			
		
actions, the amount and timing is highly unpredictable and there can be no assurance that we will achieve our anticipated results.
﻿
We reported no product revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 and minimal product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019, from the sales of our Milo-branded products. We discontinued sales of Milo products in the fourth quarter of 2019 and recognized an impairment charge for our remaining inventory, resulting in negative gross margins on our product sales.
﻿
Research and Development Expenses
﻿
Research and development expenses consist primarily of engineering and related management and support personnel costs; fees for outside engineering design services which we use from time to time to supplement our internal resources; depreciation expenses related to certain assets used in product development; prototype production and materials costs for both chips and end-user products; software licensing and support costs, which represent the annual licensing and support maintenance for engineering design and other software tools; and rent and other overhead costs for our engineering design facility. Personnel costs include share-based compensation which represents the grant date fair value of equity-based awards to our employees which is attributed to expense over the service period of the award. Subsequent to March 31, 2019, we halted substantially all research and development efforts and, where applicable, repurposed prior engineering resources to support our patent enforcement programs or our Milo sales and support.
﻿
The $0.3 million decrease in research and development expenses from 2019 to 2020 is primarily the result of $0.2 million in personnel and related costs being repurposed for selling, general and administrative purposes, including litigation support and Milo sales and support as well as a $0.1 million reduction in research and development personnel costs.
﻿
Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses
﻿
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive, director, sales and marketing, and finance and administrative personnel costs, including share-based compensation, costs incurred for advertising, insurance, shareholder relations and outside legal and professional services, including litigation expenses, and amortization and maintenance expenses related to our patent assets.
﻿
Our selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to approximately $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of approximately $3.1 million or 41%. This increase is primarily due to the recognition of $2.2 million in noncash charges upon amendment of equity-related agreements. In addition, we had a $1.3 million increase in litigation expenses primarily related to preparation of the infringement case against Qualcomm and Apple in Florida in early 2020 and a $0.6 million increase in share-based compensation due to executive and Board equity awards granted in August 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. These increases were somewhat offset by a decrease of $0.3 million in board compensation expenses due to the reversal of prior board compensation expense upon the settlement of previously accrued board fees in exchange for equity based awards in 2020, a decrease of $0.2 million in rent and related overhead due to the down-sizing of our corporate headquarters in July 2019, and a decrease in depreciation and amortization of $0.3 million resulting from lower cost bases of fixed assets and patents following disposals during 2019 and 2020.
﻿
Change in Fair Value of Contingent Payment Obligations
﻿
			
		
			
		
We have elected to measure our secured and unsecured contingent payment obligations at fair value which is based on significant unobservable inputs. We estimated the fair value of our secured contingent payment obligations using a probability-weighted income approach based on the estimated present value of projected future cash outflows using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Increases or decreases in the significant unobservable inputs could result in significant increases or decreases in fair value.
﻿
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an increase in the fair value of our secured and unsecured contingent payment obligations of approximately $8.4 million. The change in fair value estimates are a result of changes in estimated amounts and timing of projected future cash flows primarily due to the passage of time and changes in the probabilities of future cash outflows based on the status of the funded actions. In addition, in 2020, increases in fair value resulted from the sharp decrease in the risk-free interest rate used in the calculation as a result of the Federal Reserve lowering rates to stimulate economic activity amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.
﻿
Critical Accounting Policies
﻿
We believe that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates that significantly impact the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
﻿
Contingent Payment Obligations
We have accounted for our secured and unsecured contingent payment obligations as long-term debt. Our repayment obligations are contingent upon the receipt of proceeds from patent enforcement or other patent monetization actions. We have elected to measure our contingent payment obligations at their estimated fair values based on the variable and contingent nature of the repayment provisions. We have determined that the fair value of our secured and unsecured contingent payment obligations falls within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, which involves significant estimates and assumptions including projected future patent-related proceeds and the risk-adjusted rate for discounting future cash flows. Actual results could differ from the estimates made. Changes in fair value, including the component related to imputed interest, are included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss under the heading “Change in fair value of contingent payment obligations.” Refer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of the significant estimates and assumptions used in estimated the fair value of our contingent payment obligations.
﻿
Accounting for Share-Based Compensation
We calculate the fair value of share-based equity awards to employees, including restricted stock, stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”), on the date of grant and recognize the calculated fair value as compensation expense over the requisite service periods of the related awards. The fair value of stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that requires the use of highly subjective assumptions and estimates including how long employees will retain their stock options before exercising them and the volatility of our common stock price over the expected life of the equity award. Changes in these subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of share-based compensation and consequently, the related amount recognized as expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.
﻿
New Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06 "Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity." This ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current U.S. GAAP. Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. The ASU removes certain settlement
			
		
			
		
conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for the exception. The ASU also simplifies the diluted earnings per share (EPS) calculation in certain areas. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 for accelerated filers and for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years, for smaller reporting companies. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The ASU provides for a modified retrospective method of adoption whereby the guidance is applied to transactions outstanding at the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption with the cumulative effect of the change being recorded as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings. We plan to adopt ASU 2020-06 as of January 1, 2021. Adoption of ASU 2020-06 will result in an increase to our long-term debt of approximately $0.8 million, a decrease in additional paid-in-capital of approximately $1.1 million and an adjustment to our beginning retained deficit of $0.3 million resulting from the elimination of the previously recognized beneficial conversion feature as a debt discount.
﻿
Off-Balance Sheet Transactions
﻿
As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding warrants to purchase 12.9 million shares of our common stock. The estimated grant date fair value of these warrants of approximately $1.7 million is included in shareholders’ deficit in our consolidated balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2020. The outstanding warrants have an average exercise price of $0.45 per share and a weighted average remaining life of approximately 3 years.
