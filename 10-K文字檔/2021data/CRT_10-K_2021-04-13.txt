Item 7. Trustee’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Calculation of Net Profits Income
The following is a summary of the calculation of net profits income received by the Trust:
(a) Because of the interval between time of production and receipt of net profits income by the Trust, oil and gas sales for the year ended December 31 generally relate to oil production from November through October and gas production from October through September, while oil and gas sales for the quarter ended December 31 generally relate to oil production from August through October and gas production from July through September.
(b) Oil and gas sales volumes are allocated to the net profits interests by dividing Trust net cash inflows by average sales prices. As oil and gas prices change, the Trust’s allocated production volumes are impacted as the quantity of production necessary to cover expenses changes inversely with price. As such, the underlying property production volume changes may not correlate with the Trust’s allocated production volumes in any given period. Therefore, comparative discussion of oil and gas sales volumes is based on the underlying properties.
(c) Production expense includes an overhead charge which is deducted and retained by the operator. XTO Energy deducts an overhead charge as reimbursement for costs associated with monitoring these interests. See Note 5 to Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
(d) See Note 7 to Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
(e) See Note 10 to Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Results of Operations
Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Net profits income for 2020 was $5,308,249 as compared with $5,934,606 for 2019. The 11% decrease in net profits income from 2019 to 2020 was primarily because of lower oil and gas prices ($3.2 million), and decreased gas production ($0.2 million), partially offset by increased oil production ($0.8 million), decreased production expenses ($0.9 million), decreased development costs ($0.5 million), decreased taxes, transportation and other costs ($0.4 million), increased other proceeds ($0.1 million), and net excess costs activity ($0.1 million). During 2020 and 2019, 41% and 56%, respectively, of net profits income was derived from gas sales.
Trust administration expense was $639,441 in 2020 as compared to $702,643 in 2019. Cash reserve activity was $0 in 2020 and 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the reserve is funded at $1,000,000. Interest income was $5,864 in 2020 and $25,069 in 2019. Other changes in interest income are attributable to fluctuations in net profits income and interest rates.
Net profits income is recorded when received by the Trust, which is the month following receipt by XTO Energy, and generally two months after oil production and three months after gas production. Net profits income is generally affected by three major factors:
1. oil and gas sales volumes;
2. oil and gas sales prices; and
3. costs deducted in the calculation of net profits income.
Volumes
Oil. Underlying oil sales volumes increased 12% from 2019 to 2020 primarily because of the timing of cash receipts partially offset by natural production decline.
Gas. Underlying gas sales volumes decreased 7% from 2019 to 2020 primarily because of natural production decline and timing of cash receipts.
The estimated rate of natural production decline on the underlying oil and gas properties is approximately 6% to 8% a year.
Prices
Oil. The average oil price for 2020 was $40.74 per Bbl, down 23% from the 2019 average oil price of $52.79 per Bbl. Oil prices are expected to remain volatile. The average NYMEX price for November 2020 through January 2021 was $46.80 per Bbl. At March 15, 2021, the average NYMEX oil price for the following 12 months was $62.80 per Bbl.
Gas. The 2020 average gas price was $2.56 per Mcf, down 32% from the 2019 average gas price of $3.74 per Mcf. Natural gas prices are affected by natural gas liquids prices, the level of North American production, weather, crude oil prices, the U.S. economy, storage levels and export levels of liquefied natural gas. Natural gas prices are expected to remain volatile. The average NYMEX price for fourth quarter 2020 was $1.98 per MMBtu. At March 15, 2021, the average NYMEX gas price for the following 12 months was $2.72 per MMBtu.
Beginning in March 2020 and continuing into the fourth quarter of 2020, numerous events have continued to have a downward impact on sales prices of products produced from the underlying properties. The COVID-19 pandemic and the government responses to this pandemic have significantly decreased the demand for oil and gas. It is not clear at the present time when or whether pandemic restrictions will lift or when government policies may change. Additionally, market factors, including abundant supplies, have also negatively impacted prices. Even when demand returns, it could take time for these accumulated supplies to decrease and a new market equilibrium, which may be lower than the pre-pandemic equilibrium, to emerge.
Costs
Because properties underlying the 90% net profits interests are primarily royalty and overriding royalty interests, the calculation of net profits income from these interests includes deductions for production and property taxes, legal costs, and marketing and transportation charges. In addition to these costs, the calculation of net profits income from the 75% net profits interests includes deductions for production expense and development costs since the related underlying properties are working interests. Net profits income is calculated monthly for each of the five conveyances under which the net profits interests were conveyed to the Trust. If monthly costs exceed revenues for any conveyance, such excess costs must be recovered, with accrued interest, from future net proceeds of that conveyance and cannot reduce net profits income from other conveyances. Costs have never exceeded revenues from the 90% net profits interests, nor are they expected to in the future. For further information on excess costs, see Note 7 to Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Total costs deducted in the calculation of net profits income were $5.4 million in 2020 and $7.7 million in 2019. The 30% decrease in costs from 2019 to 2020 is attributable to excess costs ($0.1 million) and decreased production expense ($1.1 million), development costs ($0.6 million), and taxes, transportation and other costs ($0.5 million).
Unit operators of the properties underlying the 75% net profits interests have reported underlying budgeted development costs of approximately $1.0 million for 2021 and $0.8 million for 2022 ($0.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively, net to the Trust), as compared to underlying budgeted development costs of $2.1 million ($1.6 million net to the Trust) and actual development costs of $0.1 million ($0.1 million net to the Trust) for 2020. Actual development costs often differ from amounts budgeted because of changes in product prices and other factors that may affect the timing or selection of projects. Changes in oil or natural gas prices could impact future development plans on the underlying properties.
Other Proceeds
The calculation of net profits income for the year ended December 31, 2020 included $145,282 ($129,526 net to the Trust) from XTO Energy due to interest received on past due payments of $343,852 ($308,239 net to the Trust), partially offset by an expense adjustment of $198,570 ($178,713 net to the Trust).
Fourth Quarter 2020 and 2019
During the quarter ended December 31, 2020, the Trust received net profits income totaling $1,200,380, compared with fourth quarter 2019 net profits income of $1,468,480. This 18% decrease is primarily attributable to lower oil and gas prices ($0.9 million), partially offset by increased other proceeds ($0.1 million), decreased production expenses ($0.4 million), and increased oil production ($0.1 million).
Administration expense was $57,713 and Trust interest income was $87, resulting in fourth quarter 2020 distributable income of $1,142,754, or $0.190459 per unit. Distributable income for fourth quarter 2019 was $1,329,186, or $0.221531 per unit. Distributions to unitholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 were:
Volumes
Fourth quarter 2020 underlying oil sales volumes were 50,785 Bbls, up 5% from 2019 levels primarily due to timing of cash receipts, partially offset by natural production decline. Underlying gas sales volumes for fourth quarter 2020 were 293,660 Mcf, down 8% from 2019 levels due to natural production decline and timing of cash receipts.
Prices
The average fourth quarter 2020 oil price was $39.53 per Bbl, down 26% from the fourth quarter 2019 average price of $53.19 per Bbl. The average fourth quarter 2020 gas price was $2.31 per Mcf, down 29% from the fourth quarter 2019 average price of $3.27 per Mcf. For further information about oil and gas prices, see “Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 - Prices” above.
Costs
Costs deducted in the calculation of fourth quarter 2020 net profits income decreased $487,991, or 25%, from fourth quarter 2019. This decrease was primarily attributable to decreased production expenses ($523,766) and development costs ($64,642), partially offset by excess costs ($55,834) and increased taxes, transportation and other costs ($43,583). For further information about development and excess costs, see “Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 - Costs” above.
Other Proceeds
The calculation of net profits income for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 included $137,094 ($123,385 net to the Trust) from XTO Energy due to interest received on past due payments of $335,664 ($302,098 net to the Trust), partially offset by an expense adjustment of $198,570 ($178,713 net to the Trust).
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Trust’s only cash requirement is the monthly distribution of its income to unitholders, which is funded by the monthly receipt of net profits income after payment of Trust administration expenses. The Trust is not liable for any production costs or liabilities attributable to the underlying properties. If at any time the Trust receives net profits income in excess of the amount due, the Trust is not obligated to return such overpayment, but future net profits income payable to the Trust will be reduced by the overpayment, plus interest at the prime rate. The Trust may borrow funds required to pay Trust liabilities if fully repaid prior to further distributions to unitholders.
The Trust does not have any transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or persons that could materially affect the Trust’s liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change Regulations
There is an increased focus by local, national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change. A number of nations and U.S. states have adopted or are considering some form of climate change legislation and regulations, including carbon taxes, cap-and-trade policies and bans on drilling in certain areas or in certain ways. The climate accord reached at the Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris set many new goals, and while many related policies are still emerging, XTO Energy has informed the Trustee that it continues to anticipate that such policies will increase the cost of carbon dioxide emissions over time. As these regulations are under development, XTO Energy is unable to predict the total impact of the potential regulations upon the operators of the underlying properties, and it is possible that the operators of the underlying properties could face increases in operating costs or a ban or certain types of activities in order to comply with climate change or GHG emissions legislation, which costs could reduce or eliminate net proceeds payable to the Trust and Trust distributions.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Trust has no off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The Trust has not guaranteed the debt of any other party, nor does the Trust have any other arrangements or relationships with other entities that could potentially result in unconsolidated debt, losses or contingent obligations.
Related Party Transactions
The underlying properties from which the net profits interests were carved are currently owned by XTO Energy or other affiliated companies of ExxonMobil.
Approximately 35 of the underlying royalty interests burden working interests in properties operated by XTO Energy. XTO Energy operates the Hewitt Unit which is one of the properties underlying the Oklahoma 75% net profits interests. Other than these properties, XTO Energy and ExxonMobil do not operate or control any of the underlying properties or related working interests.
In computing net proceeds for the 75% net profits interests (Note 3), XTO Energy deducts an overhead charge as reimbursement for costs associated with monitoring these interests. This overhead charge at December 31, 2020 was approximately $43,874 per month, or $526,488 annually (net to the Trust of $32,906 per month, or $394,872 annually), and is subject to annual adjustment based on an oil and gas industry index.
XTO Energy deducts a monthly overhead charge for reimbursement of administrative expenses as operator of the Hewitt Unit, which is one of the properties underlying the Oklahoma 75% net profits interests. As of December 31, 2020, this charge was approximately $28,000 per month, or $336,000 annually (net to the Trust of $21,000 per month, or $252,000 annually), and is subject to annual adjustment based on an oil and gas industry index.
The calculation of net profits income for the year ended December 31, 2020 included other proceeds from XTO Energy of $145,282 ($129,526 net to the Trust) due to interest received on past due payments of $343,852 ($308,239 net to the Trust), partially offset by an expense adjustment of $198,570 ($178,713 net to the Trust).
On June 25, 2010, XTO Energy became a wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon Mobil Corporation.
Critical Accounting Policies
The financial statements of the Trust are significantly affected by its basis of accounting and estimates related to its oil and gas properties and proved reserves, as summarized below.
Basis of Accounting
The Trust’s financial statements are prepared on a modified cash basis, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This method of accounting is consistent with reporting of taxable income to Trust unitholders. The most significant differences between the Trust’s financial statements and those prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles are:
1. net profits income is recognized in the month received rather than accrued in the month of production;
2. expenses are recognized when paid rather than when incurred; and
3. cash reserves may be established by the Trustee for certain contingencies that would not be recorded under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
This comprehensive basis of accounting other than U.S. generally accepted accounting principles corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty trusts by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E, Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts. For further information regarding the Trust’s basis of accounting, see Note 2 to Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
All amounts included in the Trust’s financial statements are based on cash amounts received or disbursed, or on the carrying value of the net profits interests, which was derived from the historical cost of the interests at the date of their transfer from XTO Energy, less accumulated amortization to date. Accordingly, there are no fair value estimates included in the financial statements based on either exchange or non-exchange trade values.
Impairment of Net Profits Interests
The Trustee reviews the Trust’s net profits interests (“NPI”) in oil and gas properties for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the NPI may not be recoverable. In general, the Trustee
does not view temporarily low prices as an indication of impairment. The markets for crude oil and natural gas have a history of significant price volatility and though prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand. If events and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, the Trustee would use the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows from the NPI to evaluate the recoverability of the Trust assets. If the undiscounted future net cash flows from the NPI are less than the NPI carrying value, the Trust would recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the NPI carrying value and the estimated fair value of the NPI. The determination as to whether the NPI is impaired requires a significant amount of judgment by the Trustee and is based on the best information available to the Trustee at the time of the evaluation, including commodity pricing and other information provided by XTO Energy such as estimates of future production and development and operating expenses.
During the first and second quarters of 2020, trigger events occurred indicating a need for impairment assessments. Impairment assessments were completed and no impairment was indicated. During the third and fourth quarters of 2020, no trigger events occurred indicating a need for impairment assessments. Accordingly, there was no impairment of the NPI as of December 31, 2020. The Trustee will continue to monitor the NPI for impairment in future periods in light of continued price volatility. Impairments recorded for book purposes will not result in a loss for tax purposes for the unitholders until the loss is recognized.
Net profits interests in oil and gas properties
The initial carrying value of the net profits interests of $61,100,449 was XTO Energy’s historical net book value of the interests on February 12, 1991, the date of the transfer to the Trust. Amortization of the net profits interests is calculated on a unit-of-production basis using proved reserves and charged directly to trust corpus. Accumulated amortization was $53,577,384 as of December 31, 2020 and $52,938,654 as of December 31, 2019. Significantly lower 2020 oil prices used in calculating the net profits interests proved reserves could potentially result in higher amortization in 2021. Amortization of the NPI does not impact unitholder distributions.
Oil and Gas Reserves
The proved oil and gas reserves for the underlying properties are estimated by independent petroleum engineers. The estimated reserves for the underlying properties are then used by XTO Energy to calculate the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to the net profits interests. Reserve engineering is a subjective process that is dependent upon the quality of available data and the interpretation thereof. Estimates by different engineers often vary, sometimes significantly. In addition, physical factors such as the results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate, as well as economic factors such as changes in product prices, may justify revision of such estimates. Because proved reserves are required to be estimated using 12-month average prices, based on the first-day-of-the-month price for each month in the period, estimated reserve quantities can be significantly impacted by changes in product prices. Accordingly, oil and gas quantities ultimately recovered and the timing of production may be substantially different from original estimates.
The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and changes in such cash flows, as reported in Note 8 to Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, is prepared using assumptions required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such assumptions include using 12-month average oil and gas prices, based on the first-day-of-the-month price for each month in the period, and year end costs for estimated future development and production expenditures, including recovery of cumulative excess costs remaining at year end. Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using a 10% rate. Changes in any of these assumptions, including consideration of other factors, could have a significant impact on the standardized measure. Accordingly, the standardized measure does not represent XTO Energy’s or the Trustee’s estimated current market value of proved reserves.
Forward-Looking Statements
Certain information included in this annual report and other materials filed, or to be filed, by the Trust with the Securities and Exchange Commission (as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements
made or to be made by XTO Energy or the Trustee) contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, relating to the Trust, operations of the underlying properties and the oil and gas industry. Such forward-looking statements may concern, among other things, development activities, future development plans, increased density drilling, reserve-to-production ratios, future production, future net cash flows, maintenance projects, development, production, regulatory and other costs, oil and gas prices and expectations for future demand, pricing differentials, proved reserves, production levels, arbitration, litigation, liquidity, financing, political and regulatory matters, such as tax and environmental policy, climate policy, trade barriers, sanctions, and competition. Such forward-looking statements are based on XTO Energy’s and the Trustee’s current plans, expectations, assumptions, projections and estimates and are identified by words such as “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “anticipates,” “predicts,” “believes,” “goals,” “estimates,” “should,” “could,” “would,” and similar words that convey the uncertainty of future events. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual financial and operational results may differ materially from expectations, estimates or assumptions expressed in, implied in, or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. Some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are explained in Item 1A, Risk Factors.
