ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Liquidity, Capital Resources and Material Changes in Financial Condition
As of December 31, 2020, our total assets were $27,441 compared to $485,346 in assets as of December 31, 2019. This decrease in the total assets is primarily attributed to depreciation and $321,735 impairment write-down of the CyberloQ® technology fixed asset and a decrease in receivables, offset by an increase in cash. As a result of the depreciation recognized, the value of the Company’s long-lived assets decreased from $444,410 as of December 31, 2019 to $0 as of December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, our liabilities were $337,464 compared to $144,904 in liabilities as of December 31, 2019. This change in the Company’s financial condition was due to increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $46,025, an increase of $120,000 in loans from related parties, and an increase in long term note payable of $35,600. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $14,589 in customer prepayments.
Net cash used in operating activities for the year ending December 31, 2020 was $306,161 compared to net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $339,623. Cash provided by or used by operating activities is driven by our net loss and adjusted by non-cash items as well as changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2020 include depreciation of $122,675, $321,735 software impairment write-down, stock compensation of $36,140, loss on extinguishment of debt of $120,000, and bad debt expense of $40,000.
Net cash used by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0 as compared to $15,750 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $332,266 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $335,000 for the year ending December 31, 2019. Although there was no material change in the net cash provided by financing activities from 2019 to 2020, the Company relied more on notes as opposed to stock issuances in 2020. Specifically, proceeds from common stock issuance was $76,666 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $200,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, and proceeds from common stock to be issued was $60,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $115,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Conversely, proceeds from notes payable was $232,100 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $30,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The Company had operating revenue of $19,944 in 2020 and is currently reliant on its ability to raise additional capital and/or debt to continue execution of its business plan to move the Company forward towards profitability. The Company does not anticipate any significant decrease in its operating expenses for 2021. Unless the Company begins to generate operation revenue, it will be reliant on its ability to raise additional debt and/or capital in order to continue its operations.
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The Company experienced a net loss of $983,271 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net loss of $521,380 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
This increase in the Company’s net loss was due to a one-time software impairment expense of $321,725, decrease in service revenue, one-time losses on extinguishment of debt of $120,000 and recognition of bad debt expense of $40,000.
Service revenue was $19,944 for 2020 in comparison to $77,185 for 2019. This decrease in revenue was due to the Company earning $50,000 in conjunction with developing and securing a customer’s data with a private blockchain and CyberloQ during 2019. The Company did not have any similar contracts in 2020, and recognized service revenue of $5,355 from its TurnScor platform along with $14,589 in recognition of revenue from a customer’s non-refundable two-year (beginning August 28, 2018) service contract that ended in the third quarter of 2020.
For 2020, the Company issued 2,000,000 shares of common stock in satisfaction of a promissory note in the amount of $40,000 to a related party, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $120,000, compared to no loss on extinguishment of debt for 2019. The Company also had recognition of bad debt expense of $40,000 in 2020, as opposed to no recognition of bad debt in 2019.
The Company wrote-off the book value of the Cyberloq technology software fixed asset at year-end, and recorded software impairment expense of $321,725. Even though the Company has written-off the software fixed asset, due to current accounting pronouncements, it does not impact the intangible value of the Cyberloq technology that will continue to be used in the Company’s operations nor the Company’s outlook for growth and sales strategies as disclosed in a press release on March 3, 2021.
In addition to the foregoing, rent expense was $3,585 for 2020, compared to $600 for 2019. This increase was due to the Company signing a new lease agreement in 2020.
The foregoing drivers of the increase in the Company’s net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 were partially offset by decreases in the Company’s other operating expenses.
Travel and entertainment expenses were $1,785 in 2020, compared to $25,235 in 2019. This decrease in travel and entertainment expenses was due to decreased business travel during the year.
Stock compensation expenses were $36,140 for 2020, compared to $60,570 for 2019. This decrease in stock compensation expenses was due to the Company’s stock price being lower in 2020 when the stock was issued as compared to the Company’s stock price in 2019 when the stock was issued.
Professional fees were $56,483 in 2020, compared to $63,731 in 2019. This decrease was due to a reduction in accounting and legal fees in 2020.
Computer and internet expenses were $7,759 in 2020 as compared to $18,605 in 2019. This decrease was due to lower hosting costs associated with the Company’s private blockchain product.
Other operating expenses were $12,049 in 2020 as compared to $18,172 in 2019. This decrease was due to a reduction in advertising costs.
Sales commissions were $2,011 in 2020, compared to $8,259 in 2019. This decrease in sales commissions was primarily due to a decrease in service revenue generated from the Turnscor platform
Research and development expenses were $2,100 in 2020, compared to $6,193 in 2019. This decrease in research was due to costs incurred in 2019 associated with updates to the Company’s website.
For 2020, there were no material changes in officers’ compensation, office supplies and expenses, or depreciation expense as compared to 2019.
In summary, total revenue was $19,944 for 2020. The Company is currently reliant on its ability to raise additional debt and/or capital to continue execution of its business plan to move forward towards profitability. Whether or not there are any material changes in operational revenues or expenses in 2021 will be highly-dependent upon the Company’s ability to enter into material revenue contracts with customers.
