Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion analyzes our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, wherein WES Operating is fully consolidated, and which are included under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, and the information set forth in Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
The Partnership’s assets include assets owned and ownership interests accounted for by us under the equity method of accounting, through our 98.0% partnership interest in WES Operating, as of December 31, 2020 (see Note 7-Equity Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). We also own and control the entire non-economic general partner interest in WES Operating GP, and our general partner is owned by Occidental; therefore, prior asset acquisitions from Anadarko were classified as transfers of net assets between entities under common control. As such, subsequent to asset acquisitions from Anadarko, we were required to recast our financial statements to include the activities of acquired assets from the date of common control.
For reporting periods that required recast, the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the acquisition of assets from Anadarko were prepared from Anadarko’s historical cost-basis accounts and may not be necessarily indicative of the actual results of operations that would have occurred if we had owned the assets during the periods reported. For ease of reference, we refer to the historical financial results of the Partnership’s assets prior to the acquisitions from Anadarko as being “our” historical financial results.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
We are a midstream energy company organized as a publicly traded partnership, engaged in the business of gathering, compressing, treating, processing, and transporting natural gas; gathering, stabilizing, and transporting condensate, NGLs, and crude oil; and gathering and disposing of produced water. In our capacity as a natural-gas processor, we also buy and sell natural gas, NGLs, and condensate on behalf of ourselves and as an agent for our customers under certain contracts. We own or have investments in assets located in Texas, New Mexico, the Rocky Mountains (Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming), and North-central Pennsylvania. As of December 31, 2020, our assets and investments consisted of the following:
_________________________________________________________________________________________
(1)Includes the DBM water systems.
Significant financial and operational events during the year ended December 31, 2020, included the following:
•In January 2020, WES Operating completed an offering of $3.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of Fixed-Rate Senior Notes and $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Floating-Rate Senior Notes. Net proceeds from these offerings were used to repay and terminate the Term loan facility, repay outstanding amounts under the RCF, and for general partnership purposes. See Liquidity and Capital Resources within this Item 7 for additional information.
•In November 2020, we announced a buyback program of up to $250.0 million of our common units through December 31, 2021. We repurchased 2,368,711 units for aggregate consideration of $32.5 million through December 31, 2020.
•In October 2020, we (i) sold our 14.81% interest in Fort Union, which was accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and (ii) entered into an option agreement to sell the Bison treating facility to a third party, exercisable during the first quarter of 2021.
•On September 11, 2020, WES and Occidental entered into a Unit Redemption Agreement, pursuant to which (i) WES Operating transferred and assigned its interest in the Anadarko note receivable to its limited partners on a pro-rata basis, transferring 98% of its interest in (and accrued interest owed under) the Anadarko note receivable to WES and the remaining 2% to WGRAH, a subsidiary of Occidental, (ii) WES subsequently assigned the 98% interest in (and accrued interest owed under) the Anadarko note receivable to Anadarko, which Anadarko canceled and retired immediately upon receipt, in exchange for which Occidental caused certain of its subsidiaries to transfer an aggregate of 27,855,398 common units of WES to WES, and (iii) WES canceled such common units immediately upon receipt.
•Our fourth-quarter 2020 distribution is unchanged from the first-, second-, and third-quarter 2020 per-unit distribution of $0.31100.
•During the year ended December 31, 2020, WES Operating purchased and retired $218.0 million of certain of its senior notes and Floating-Rate Senior Notes. See Liquidity and Capital Resources within this Item 7 for additional information.
•We commenced operations of Latham Train II at the DJ Basin complex (with capacity of 250 MMcf/d) during the first quarter of 2020 and Loving ROTF Trains III and IV at the DBM oil system (with capacity of 30 MBbls/d each) during the first and third quarters of 2020, respectively.
•Effective with the execution of the December 2019 agreements, WES began the transition to a stand-alone midstream business resulting in efficiencies between our commercial, engineering, and operations teams, enabling our organization to realize operating and capital savings. This effort has involved, among other things, a transition from Occidental’s Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system to a stand-alone ERP system, and the transition to a WES-dedicated workforce with its own compensation and benefits structure.
•Natural-gas throughput attributable to WES totaled 4,274 MMcf/d for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing a 1% increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
•Crude-oil and NGLs throughput attributable to WES totaled 698 MBbls/d for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing a 7% increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
•Produced-water throughput attributable to WES totaled 698 MBbls/d for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing a 28% increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
•Operating income (loss) was $878.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 (included goodwill and long-lived asset impairments of $644.9 million), representing a 29% decrease compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
•Adjusted gross margin for natural-gas assets (as defined under the caption How We Evaluate Our Operations within this Item 7) averaged $1.16 per Mcf for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing an 8% increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
•Adjusted gross margin for crude-oil and NGLs assets (as defined under the caption How We Evaluate Our Operations within this Item 7) averaged $2.54 per Bbl for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing a 4% increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
•Adjusted gross margin for produced-water assets (as defined under the caption How We Evaluate Our Operations within this Item 7) averaged $0.98 per Bbl for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing a 1% increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
The following table provides additional information on throughput for the periods presented below:
During 2020, the global outbreak of COVID-19 caused a sharp decline in the worldwide demand for oil, natural gas, and NGLs, which contributed significantly to commodity-price declines and oversupplied commodities markets. These market dynamics have an adverse impact on producers that provide throughput into our systems, and we have experienced decreased throughput at many of our locations.
Additionally, many of our employees have been and may continue to be subject to pandemic-related work-from-home requirements, which requires us to take additional actions to ensure that the number of personnel accessing our network remotely does not lead to excessive cyber-security risk levels. Similarly, we are working continually to ensure operational changes that we have made to promote the health and safety of our personnel during this pandemic do not unduly disrupt intracompany communications and key business processes. We consider our risk-mitigation efforts adequate; however, the ultimate impact of the ongoing pandemic is unpredictable, with direct and indirect impacts to our business. See Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for additional information on these and other risks.
WES continues to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely, and as state and federal governments issue additional guidance, we will update our own policy responses to ensure the safety and health of our workforce and communities. The federal government has provided guidance to states on how to safely return personnel to the workplace, which we are following as our workforce returns to WES locations. All WES facilities, including field locations, have been conducting enhanced routine cleaning and disinfecting of common areas and frequently touched surfaces using CDC- and EPA-approved products. Our return-to-work protocols include daily required application-based health self-assessments that must be completed prior to accessing WES work locations.
ITEMS AFFECTING THE COMPARABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS
Our historical results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented may not be comparable to future or historic results of operations or cash flows for the reasons described below. Refer to Operating Results within this Item 7 for a discussion of our results of operations as compared to the prior periods.
Commodity purchase and sale agreements. Effective April 1, 2020, changes to marketing-contract terms with AESC terminated AESC’s prior status as an agent of the Partnership for third-party sales and established AESC as a customer of the Partnership. Accordingly, we no longer recognize service revenues and/or product sales revenues and the equivalent cost of product expense for the marketing services performed by AESC. Year-over-year variances for the year ended December 31, 2020, include the following impacts related to this change (i) decrease of $130.9 million in Service revenues - fee based, (ii) decrease of $29.7 million in Product sales, and (iii) decrease of $160.6 million in Cost of product expense. These changes had no impact to Operating income (loss), Net income (loss), the balance sheets, cash flows, or any non-GAAP metric used to evaluate our operations (see How We Evaluate Our Operations within this Item 7). See Note 6-Related-Party Transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Gathering and processing agreements. Certain of the gathering agreements for the West Texas complex, Springfield system, DJ Basin oil system, Marcellus Interest systems, and DBM oil and water systems allow for rate resets that target an agreed-upon rate of return over the life of the agreement. See Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Acquisitions and divestitures. In February 2019, WES Operating acquired AMA from Anadarko. In January 2019, we acquired a 30% interest in Red Bluff Express. In June 2018, we acquired a 20% interest in Whitethorn LLC and a 15% interest in Cactus II.
In October 2020, we (i) sold our 14.81% interest in Fort Union, which was accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and (ii) entered into an option agreement to sell the Bison treating facility to a third party exercisable during the first quarter of 2021. In December 2018, the Newcastle system in Northeast Wyoming was sold to a third party. See Note 3-Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Impairments. We recognized long-lived asset and other impairments of $203.9 million, $6.3 million, and $230.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we also recognized a goodwill impairment of $441.0 million, which reduced the carrying value of goodwill for the gathering and processing reporting unit to zero.
For a description of impairments recorded, see Note 9-Property, Plant, and Equipment, Note 7-Equity Investments, and Note 10-Goodwill and Other Intangibles in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
General and administrative expenses. On December 31, 2019, we entered into the December 2019 Agreements, which helped facilitate our ability to operate more independently from Occidental. As a result, during 2020, we began incurring costs to (i) implement technology systems to manage the operations and administration of our day-to-day business, (ii) secure our dedicated workforce, and (iii) operate as a stand-alone entity. See Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Noncontrolling interests. For periods subsequent to Merger completion, our noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements consist of (i) the 25% third-party interest in Chipeta and (ii) the 2.0% Occidental subsidiary-owned limited partner interest in WES Operating. For periods prior to Merger completion, our noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements consisted of (i) the 25% third-party interest in Chipeta, (ii) the publicly held limited partner interests in WES Operating, (iii) the common units issued by WES Operating to subsidiaries of Anadarko as part of the consideration paid for prior acquisitions from Anadarko, and (iv) the Class C units issued by WES Operating to a subsidiary of Anadarko as part of the funding for the acquisition of DBM.
Commodity-price swap agreements. The consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of equity and partners’ capital included the impacts of commodity-price swap agreements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. See Note 6-Related-Party Transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information regarding the commodity-price swap agreements with Anadarko that expired without renewal on December 31, 2018.
Income taxes. With respect to assets acquired from Anadarko, we recorded Anadarko’s historic current and deferred income taxes for the periods prior to our ownership of the assets. For periods subsequent to asset acquisitions from Anadarko, we are not subject to tax except for the Texas margin tax and, accordingly, do not record current and deferred federal income taxes related to such assets.
OUR OPERATIONS
Our results primarily are driven by the volumes of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, and produced water we service through our systems. In our operations, we contract with customers to provide midstream services focused on natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, and produced water. We gather natural gas from individual wells or production facilities located near our gathering systems and the natural gas may be compressed and delivered to a processing plant, treating facility, or downstream pipeline, and ultimately to end users. We treat and process a significant portion of the natural gas that we gather so that it will satisfy required specifications for pipeline transportation. We gather crude oil from individual wells or production facilities located near our gathering systems, and in some cases, treat or stabilize the crude oil to satisfy required specifications for pipeline transportation. We also gather and dispose of produced water.
We operate in Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and North-central Pennsylvania, with a substantial portion of our business concentrated in West Texas and the Rocky Mountains. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2020, our West Texas and DJ Basin assets provided (i) 46% and 38%, respectively, of Total revenues and other, (ii) 33% each of our throughput for natural-gas assets (excluding equity-investment throughput), (iii) 57% and 31%, respectively, of our throughput for crude-oil and NGLs assets (excluding equity-investment throughput), and (iv) all of our throughput for produced-water assets.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, 66% of Total revenues and other, 41% of our throughput for natural-gas assets (excluding equity-investment throughput), 88% of our throughput for crude-oil and NGLs assets (excluding equity-investment throughput), and 87% of our throughput for produced-water assets were attributable to production owned or controlled by Occidental. While Occidental is our contracting counterparty, these arrangements with Occidental include not just Occidental-produced volumes, but also, in some instances, the volumes of other working-interest owners of Occidental who rely on our facilities and infrastructure to bring their volumes to market. In addition, Occidental provides dedications and/or minimum-volume commitments under certain of our contracts.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, 93% of our wellhead natural-gas volume (excluding equity investments) and 100% of our crude-oil and produced-water throughput (excluding equity investments) were serviced under fee-based contracts under which fixed and variable fees are received based on the volume or thermal content of the natural gas and on the volume of NGLs, crude oil, and produced water we gather, process, treat, transport, or dispose. This type of contract provides us with a relatively stable revenue stream that is not subject to direct commodity-price risk, except to the extent that (i) we retain and sell drip condensate that is recovered during the gathering of natural gas from the wellhead or production facilities or (ii) actual recoveries differ from contractual recoveries under a limited number of processing agreements.
We also have indirect exposure to commodity-price risk in that the relatively volatile commodity-price environment has caused and may continue to cause current or potential customers to delay drilling or shut-in production in certain areas, which would reduce the volumes of hydrocarbons available to our systems. We also bear limited commodity-price risk through the settlement of imbalances. Read
