ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the section titled “Selected Financial Data” and our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis and other parts of this report contain forward-looking statements based upon current beliefs, plans and expectations related to future events and our future financial performance that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as statements regarding our intentions, plans, objectives, expectations, forecasts and projections. Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those set forth under the section titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this report.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a novel therapeutic product for the acute treatment of migraine. Our product candidate, STS101, is a drug-device combination of a proprietary dry-powder formulation of dihydroergotamine mesylate, or DHE, which is designed to be quickly and easily self-administered with a proprietary pre-filled, single-use, nasal delivery device. DHE products have long been recommended as a first-line therapeutic option for the acute treatment of migraine and have significant advantages over other therapeutics for many patients. However, broad use has been limited by invasive and burdensome administration and/or sub-optimal clinical performance of available injectable and liquid nasal spray products. STS101 is specifically designed to deliver the clinical advantages of DHE while overcoming these shortcomings. If approved, we believe STS101 has the potential to be an important and differentiated option for the acute treatment of migraine that can address the unmet needs of many people living with migraines.
We completed enrollment in our EMERGE Phase 3 efficacy trial in May 2020, randomizing more than the planned 1,140 migraine patients to one of two STS101 dose strengths or placebo. In September 2020, we announced topline data from the EMERGE trial. Although STS101 3.9 mg and 5.2 mg showed favorable numerical differences versus placebo on the pre-specified co-primary endpoints of freedom from pain and freedom from most bothersome symptom (from among photophobia, phonophobia and nausea) at two hours post-administration, these differences did not achieve statistical significance for either dose strength. Both dose strengths of STS101 did, however, demonstrate significant effects on both freedom from pain and most bothersome symptom by three hours post-dose and later time points. Both STS101 dose strengths were well-tolerated in the EMERGE trial, with low adverse event rates and no serious adverse events reported. Based on our analyses and review of EMERGE trial results and other data, including preliminary results from our ongoing open-label, Phase 3 long-term safety trial of STS101 5.2 mg, or ASCEND, we believe we have identified and are taking steps to address the key reasons that STS101 did not achieve statistical significance for either dose strength. In March 2021, we announced an update to our development plan for STS101 that takes into account the findings from our analyses of results from our STS101 Phase 3 EMERGE efficacy trial in which STS101 demonstrated favorable numerical trends but did not achieve statistical significance versus placebo on the study’s co-primary endpoints. Our updated development plan for STS101 includes a Phase 1 trial, which we expect to complete the second quarter of 2021, to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of STS101 5.2 mg and two higher dose strengths, as well as a new STS101 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy trial that we anticipate initiating in mid-2021, with topline results expected in the second half of 2022. If successful, we could file a new drug application, or NDA, for STS101 by the end of 2022.
As we continue the development of STS101, our expenses may increase substantially, as we seek to advance STS101 through clinical development, manufacturing scale-up and regulatory approval, and prepare for commercialization of STS101, if approved.
Since our inception in June 2016, we have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial resources in the development of STS101 for the acute treatment of migraine. We have incurred significant operating losses to date and expect that our operating expenses will increase significantly as we advance STS101 through clinical development, manufacturing and regulatory approval, and as we prepare for commercialization of STS101, if approved; obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio; and hire additional personnel. In addition, we expect to incur increasing costs associated with operating as a public company.
Our net losses were $47.6 million, $28.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $90.6 million.
We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any product revenue since our inception. Prior to the completion of our IPO in September 2019, we have funded our operations primarily with an aggregate of $78.8 million in gross cash proceeds from the sale and issuance of convertible preferred stock, a convertible promissory note, and long-term debt.
In September 2019, we sold and issued 5,500,000 shares of common stock at $15.00 per share for gross proceeds of $82.5 million. In October 2019, we sold and issued an additional 552,116 shares of common stock at $15.00 per share for gross proceeds of $8.3 million as a result of the partial exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. These gross proceeds are before underwriting discounts, commissions and offering costs. Upon the closing of our IPO, all redeemable convertible preferred shares then outstanding automatically converted into 9,936,341 shares of common stock, 5,116 warrants were net exercised immediately after the IPO resulting issuance of 4,801 shares of common stock. In August 2020, the remaining 5,116 warrants were net exercised resulting issuance of 4,900 shares of common stock.
In October 2020, we entered into a sales agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with SVB Leerink LLC (“SVB”) to sell shares of our common stock, from time to time, through an at-the-market equity offering program under which SVB will act as its sales agent and pursuant to which we may sell common stock for aggregate gross sales proceeds of up to $50 million. The issuance and sale of shares of common stock by us pursuant to the Sales Agreement is deemed an “at-the-market” offering under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. SVB is entitled to compensation for its services equal to up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds of any shares of common stock sold through SVB under the Sales Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, we had not received any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement.
In February 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain purchasers, pursuant to which we agreed to sell and issue to certain purchasers an aggregate of 14,084,507 shares of our common stock at a per share purchase price of $5.68, the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on February 26, 2021, for gross proceeds of $80.0 million (“Private Placement”).
Our ability to generate product revenue will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of STS101. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of STS101, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue the development and commercialization of STS101.
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $68.2 million. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as well as the proceeds from the recent Private Placement, will be sufficient to fund our projected operations for at least 12 months from the issuance of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 and into the second half of 2023.
COVID-19
A novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. COVID-19 has placed strains on the providers of healthcare services, including the healthcare clinics and institutions where we conduct our ongoing clinical trials and may conduct planned clinical trials. Some clinics and institutions have taken measures to alleviate these strains, such as by prohibiting the initiation of new clinical trials, enrollment in existing trials and restricting the on-site monitoring of clinical trials. In August 2020, we initiated patient enrollment in our ASCEND open-label, Phase 3 safety trial of STS101in accordance with our previously communicated timeline objectives. We will continue to follow FDA guidance on clinical trial conduct during the COVID-19 pandemic, including with respect to remote monitoring of clinical data. To date, patients in our EMERGE and ASCEND clinical trials have generally been able to complete their scheduled visits and we have been able to collect the essential data from those visits as well as from the internet-connected electronic diary devices all patients in these trials use to record efficacy and other key
data.
To date, we have not experienced any disruption in our supply chain of drug necessary to conduct our clinical trials and, given our drug inventories, believe we will be able to supply the drug needs of our clinical trials. We are supporting our employees by utilizing remote work when necessary and appropriate, leveraging virtual meeting technology and encouraging employees to follow local guidelines.
The following summarizes our priorities and actions to address the COVID-19 disruption and its impact on our operations:
Health & Safety
•
The health and well-being of our employees, patients in our clinical trials, employees at our clinical trial sites and supply chain partners is our top priority.
•
We have implemented strict measures to ensure and maintain safety, including working remotely when necessary and appropriate, social distancing and enhanced protocols to allow, if deemed necessary, remote monitoring and in-home testing of the subjects participating in our clinical trials.
•
We are closely monitoring rapidly evolving conditions throughout the United States and the rest of the world and are adhering to local, state and federal guidelines.
Business Continuity
•
The ongoing pandemic is challenging the healthcare and the clinical trial infrastructure worldwide. However, the EMERGE trial benefited from a design with a limited number of clinical study site visits. Moreover, our EMERGE trial sites were all in the United States and mostly at standalone clinics not co-located with hospitals. In addition, in March 2020 we implemented an IRB approved Contingency Study Visit plan for our EMERGE trial, which provided increased visit scheduling flexibility, options for home or drive through visits and telemedicine options (consistent with recent FDA guidance on conducting clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic). We also implemented remote site monitoring activities.
•
In August 2020, we initiated patient enrollment in our ASCEND open-label, Phase 3 safety trial of STS101. While we expect our ASCEND safety trial to benefit from some of the similar design features that enabled our EMERGE clinical trial to be completed on schedule, there can be no assurance that clinical site initiation and enrollment will not be delayed or otherwise negatively affected.
•
We are working closely with our supply chain partners globally to maintain the levels of drug product and proprietary nasal delivery devices to conduct existing and planned clinical trials, as suppliers support the health and safety of their employees.
Financial Resources
We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as well as the proceeds from the recent Private Placement, will be adequate to fund our currently projected operations for at least 12 months from the issuance of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 and into the second half of 2023.
Components of Operating Results
Operating Expenses
Research and Development Expenses
All of our research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with the development of STS101 for the acute treatment of migraine. These expenses include:
•
payroll and personnel-related expenses, including salaries, annual cash bonuses, employee benefit costs and stock-based compensation expenses for our research and product development employees;
•
fees paid to third parties to conduct preclinical and clinical studies and other research and development activities, including contract research organizations, or CROs, contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and other service providers; and
•
costs for licenses and allocated overhead, including rent, equipment, depreciation, information technology costs and utilities.
We expense both internal and external research and development expenses as they are incurred. We have entered into various agreements with CROs and CMOs. Our research and development accruals are estimated based on the level of services performed, progress of the studies, including the phase or completion of events or tasks, and contracted costs. The estimated costs of research and development provided, but not yet invoiced, are included in accrued and other current liabilities on the balance sheet. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the original estimates, we adjust the accrual accordingly. Payments made to CROs and CMOs under these arrangements in advance of the performance of the related services are recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets until the services are rendered. Nonrefundable payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet. The capitalized amounts are recognized as expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed.
As we continue the development of STS101, our research and development expenses may increase substantially, as we seek to advance STS101 through clinical development, manufacturing and regulatory approval, and prepare for commercialization of STS101, if approved. Predicting the timing or the cost to complete our clinical trials or validation of our commercial manufacturing and supply processes is difficult and delays may occur because of many factors, including factors outside of our control. For example, if the FDA or other regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate, if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials or if we experience delays in manufacturing with any of our CMOs, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. Furthermore, we are unable to predict with any certainty when or if STS101 will receive regulatory approval.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist principally of payroll and personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expenses, professional fees for legal, consulting, accounting and tax services, directors and officers insurance, allocated overhead, including rent, debt service, equipment, depreciation, information technology costs, and utilities, and other general operating expenses not otherwise classified as research and development expenses including marketing expenses due to pre-commercialization activities.
We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase as a result of increased personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expenses, expanded infrastructure and higher consulting, legal and accounting services associated with maintaining compliance with stock exchange listing and Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, requirements, marketing expenses due to pre-commercialization activities, investor relations costs and director and officer insurance premiums associated with being a public company.
Interest Income
Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists primarily of interest related to our long-term debt and accretion of debt discount and debt issuance costs.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net primarily consists of changes in the fair value of convertible preferred stock tranche liability and the obligation to issue additional shares of common stock.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses increased by $12.1 million, or 50%, from the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to a net increase of $9.8 million in fees paid to CROs and CMOs as a result of increased clinical trial activities, an increase of $2.5 million in payroll and personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expenses, due to increases in headcount and stock options granted to existing employees, partially offset by a decrease of travel expenses of $0.3 million as a result of reduced travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses increased by $7.4 million, or 157%, from the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of $4.1 million of director and officer liability insurance, professional fees for legal, consulting, accounting, tax and other services, an increase of $2.2 million of payroll and personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expenses, due to increases in headcount and stock options granted to existing employees and an increase of $0.8 million in marketing expenses due to pre-commercialization activities. The COVID-19 pandemic did not have any measurable impact on general and administrative expenses other than a reduction in travel expenses.
Interest Income
Interest income decreased by $0.1 million, or 6%, from the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2020, which was primarily due to a decrease in our average balances of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased by $0.1 million, or 27%, from the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2020, which was primarily attributable to decrease of outstanding debt balances.
Liquidity and Capital Resources; Plan of Operations
Sources of Liquidity
Prior to the completion of our IPO in September 2019, we had funded our operations since our inception primarily through private placements of convertible preferred stock, a convertible promissory note, and long-term debt. We do not have any products approved for sale and have never generated any revenue. In August 2016, we received $0.1 million under a convertible promissory note. We received gross cash proceeds of $6.0 million from the sale and issuance of Series A convertible preferred stock during the year ended December 31, 2016, and gross cash proceeds of $6.0 million from the sale and issuance of Series A convertible preferred stock during the year ended December 31, 2018. In April 2019, we received gross cash proceeds of $61.7 million from the sale and issuance of Series B convertible preferred stock. We also entered into the credit facility described below with Silicon Valley Bank.
In September 2019, we sold and issued 5,500,000 shares of common stock at $15.00 per share for gross proceeds of $82.5 million. In October 2019, we sold and issued an additional 552,116 shares at $15.00 per share for gross proceeds of $8.3 million as a result of the partial exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. These gross proceeds are before underwriting discounts, commissions and offering costs.
In October 2020, we entered into the Sales Agreement with SVB to sell shares of our common stock, from time to time, through an at-the-market equity offering program under which SVB will act as its sales agent and pursuant to which we may sell common stock for aggregate gross sales proceeds of up to $50 million. To date we have not received any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement.
In February 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain purchasers, pursuant to which we agreed to sell and issue to certain purchasers an aggregate of 14,084,507 shares of our common stock at a per share purchase price of $5.68, the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on February 26, 2021 for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $80.0 million.
Credit Facility
In October 2018, we entered into the Loan Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank. The Loan Agreement provides for loan advances of up to $10.0 million. We drew down the first advance of $5.0 million as of the effective date of the Loan Agreement. The remaining $5.0 million is available for draw down in $1.0 million increments. The Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, including covenants and restrictions that among other things, restrict our ability to incur liens, incur additional indebtedness, make loans and investments, engage in mergers and acquisitions, engage in asset sales or sale and leaseback transactions, and declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock. Interest on the loan advances is payable monthly at a floating per annum rate equal to the greater of 1.5% above the prime rate and 6.5%. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, interest will increase to 5.0% above the rate that is otherwise applicable. Principal on the outstanding loan advance is repayable commencing on December 1, 2019 in 30 monthly payments through maturity. The maturity date of the loan advances is May 1, 2022.
Future Funding Requirements
We have incurred net losses since our inception. Our net losses were $47.6 million and $28.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Based on our current business plan, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as well as the proceeds from the recent Private Placement will be sufficient to fund our projected operations for at least 12 months from the issuance of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 and into the second half of 2023.
As we continue the development of STS101, our research and development expenses may increase substantially, as we seek to advance STS101 through clinical development, manufacturing and regulatory approval, and prepare for commercialization of STS101, if approved.
To the extent we continue development of STS101, we will continue to require additional capital to fund operations for the foreseeable future. We do not expect to generate any meaningful revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize STS101 or enter into collaborative agreements with third parties, and we do not know when, or if, either will occur. We may seek to raise capital through private or public equity or debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements with corporate sources, or through other sources of financing. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue the development and commercialization of STS101. Our need for additional capital will depend on many factors, including:
•
the scope, timing, rate of progress, results and costs of our clinical trials for STS101, including our planned Phase 1 clinical trial and Phase 3 efficacy trial for STS101 and including in connection with any clinical program we may pursue in any foreign jurisdictions;
•
the number and scope of clinical programs we decide to pursue;
•
the scope and costs of manufacturing development and commercial manufacturing activities;
•
the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory review of STS101;
•
the cost of building a sales force in anticipation of commercialization of STS101;
•
the cost and timing associated with commercializing STS101, if approved;
•
the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;
•
any product liability or other lawsuits related to STS101;
•
our efforts to enhance operational systems and our ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, including personnel to support the commercialization of STS101;
•
the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates or technologies;
•
the payment of royalty payments owed under our existing license agreement;
•
our ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;
•
the costs associated with being a public company; and
•
the timing, receipt and amount of sales of STS101, if approved.
We are subject to the risks typically related to the development of new product candidates, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. Despite our implementation of a new development plan for STS101, such plan may change, which could significantly change the costs and timing associated with its development of STS101 and our operations. Furthermore, our operating plans may change in the future, and we will continue to require additional capital to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plans. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Any debt financing into which we enter may impose upon us covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock, make certain investments or engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions. For example, the Loan Agreement contains many of these restrictions. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce, or terminate our development program and clinical trials. We may also be required to sell or license to others rights to STS101 in certain territories or indications that we would prefer to develop and commercialize ourselves. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. See “Risk Factors” for additional risks associated with our substantial capital requirements.
Summary Statement of Cash Flows
The following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for each of the periods presented below:
Cash Flows used in Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $42.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the use of funds in our operations to develop STS101, which resulted in a net loss of $47.6 million, adjusted for a decrease of accounts payable by $1.6 million, which amounts were partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $1.4 million, an increase in accrued and other liabilities of $1.0 million, depreciation expense of $0.2 million, non-cash interest expense and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $0.1 million, net amortization of premiums and discounts on marketable securities of $0.1 million and stock-based compensation expense of $4.0 million. The decrease in accounts payable and prepaid expenses and other assets and increase in accrued and other liabilities were primarily the result of the timing of payments to our vendors.
Net cash used in operating activities was $29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the use of funds in our operations to develop STS101, which resulted in a net loss of $28.2 million, adjusted for an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $6.5 million and a decrease of other non-current liabilities by $0.1 million, net amortization of premiums and discounts on marketable securities of $0.1 million, which amounts were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $4.0 million, an increase in accrued and other liabilities of $0.2 million, depreciation expense of $0.1 million, stock-based compensation expense of $0.7 million, non-cash interest expense and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $0.1 million. The increase in accounts payable resulted from the timing of payments to our service providers. The increase in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accrued research and development and accrued compensation.
Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities was $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which consisted of proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of $97.2 million, which amounts were partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $34.0 million and purchases of property and equipment of $5.2 million mainly related to construction of the Company's dry powder nasal DHE filling station which is waiting for installation and final acceptance.
Net cash used in investing activities was $95.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which consisted of purchases of marketable securities of $99.9 million, which amounts were partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of $4.5 million and purchases of property and equipment of $0.5 million.
Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which primarily related to repayment of debt of $2.0 million and payment of offering costs of $0.2 million, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of common stock options of $0.1 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $143.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which consisted of $61.5 million of net cash proceeds from our issuance of Series B convertible preferred stock, $81.4 million of net cash proceeds from our IPO and $0.3 million from exercise of stock options, partially offset by repayment of debt of 0.2 million.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We lease our office facilities in South San Francisco, California and in North Carolina. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases were $0.3 million as of December 31, 2020.
In October 2018, we entered into the Loan Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank. The maturity date of the loan advances is May 1, 2022. Total future contractual maturities of the loan were $2.8 million as of December 31, 2020.
We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with third-party contract organizations for clinical trials, manufacturing and testing and providing other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination following a certain period after notice, and therefore we believe that our non-cancelable obligations under these agreements are not material.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Since our inception, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Critical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments and Use of Estimates
Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates. For more detail on our critical accounting policies, refer to Note 1 to the financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Accrued Research and Development
We monitor the activity under its various agreements with CROs, CMOs and other service providers to the extent possible through communication with each service provider, detailed invoice and task completion review, analysis of actual expenses against budget, pre-approval of any changes in scope, and review of contractual terms. Our research and development accruals are estimated based on the level of services performed, progress of the studies, including the phase or completion of events, and contracted costs. These estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the service providers. The estimated costs of research and development provided, but not yet invoiced, are included in accrued liabilities on the balance sheet. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the original estimates, we will adjust the accrual accordingly. Payments made to service providers under these arrangements in advance of the performance of the related services are recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets until the services are rendered.
Stock-Based Compensation
We use a fair value-based method to account for all stock-based compensation arrangements with employees and non-employees, including stock options and stock awards. Our determination of the fair value of stock options on the date of grant utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the option granted is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which an optionee is required to provide services in exchange for the option award, known as the requisite service period, which usually is the vesting period. We
account for forfeitures as they occur. Estimates of the fair value of equity awards as of the grant date using valuation models such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model are affected by several assumptions. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value and ultimately the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop. Changes in the following assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of stock-based compensation:
•
Expected Term - The expected term is calculated using the simplified method, which is available where there is insufficient historical data about exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The simplified method is based on the vesting period and the contractual term for each grant, or for each vesting-tranche for awards with graded vesting. The mid-point between the vesting date and the maximum contractual expiration date is used as the expected term under this method. For awards with multiple vesting-tranches, the times from grant until the mid-points for each of the tranches may be averaged to provide an overall expected term.
•
Expected Volatility - For all stock options granted to date, the volatility data was estimated based on a study of publicly traded industry peer companies as we did not have any trading history for our common stock. For purposes of identifying these peer companies, we considered the industry, stage of development, size and financial leverage of potential comparable companies. For each grant, we measured historical volatility over a period equivalent to the expected term. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available.
•
Expected Dividend - The Black-Scholes valuation model calls for a single expected dividend yield as an input. We currently have no history or expectation of paying cash dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, we have estimated the dividend yield to be zero.
•
Risk-Free Interest Rate - The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on U.S. Treasury instruments whose term is similar in duration to the expected term of the respective stock option.
Common Stock Valuations
Prior to our IPO, the estimated fair value of the common stock underlying our stock options and stock awards was determined at each grant date by our board of directors, with assistance from management and external appraisers. All options to purchase shares of our common stock were intended to be exercisable at a price per share not less than the per-share fair value of our common stock underlying those options on the date of grant. The approach to estimate the fair value of the Company’s common stock was consistent with the methods outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, or Practice Aid. Subsequent to the Company’s IPO, the fair value of the Company’s common stock is determined based on its closing market price.
JOBS Act Accounting Election
The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, permits an “emerging growth company” such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period under the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of issuers who are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are applicable to public companies, which may make comparison of our financials to those of other public companies more difficult.
