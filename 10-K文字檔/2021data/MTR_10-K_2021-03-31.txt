Item 7. Trustee’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Trust Overview
The following review of Mesa Royalty Trust’s (the “Trust”) financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto. The discussion of net production attributable to the Hugoton Royalty Properties and San Juan Basin Royalty Properties (as each is defined below) represents production volumes that are to a large extent hypothetical as the Trust does not own and is not entitled to any specific production volumes. Any discussion of “actual” production volumes represents the hydrocarbons that were produced from the properties in which the Trust has an overriding royalty interest.
The Trust was created on November 1, 1979 and is now governed by the Mesa Royalty Trust Indenture (as amended, the “Trust Indenture”). Through a series of conveyances, assignments, and acquisitions, the Trust currently owns an overriding royalty interest (the “Royalty”) equal to 11.44% of 90% of the Net Proceeds (as defined and described in an Overriding Royalty Conveyance, dated as of November 1, 1979 (the “Conveyance”)) attributable to the specified interest in certain producing oil and gas properties located in the:
•
Hugoton field of Kansas (the “Hugoton Royalty Properties”);
•
San Juan Basin field of New Mexico (the “San Juan Basin - New Mexico Properties”);
•
San Juan Basin field of Colorado (the “San Juan Basin - Colorado Properties”, and together with the “San Juan Basin - New Mexico Properties, the “San Juan Basin Royalty Properties”, and together with the Hugoton Royalty Properties, the “Royalty Properties”).
Pursuant to past conveyances, Scout, Hilcorp, IKAV, and Red Willow are the operators of certain portions of the Hugoton Royalty Properties and San Juan Basin Royalty Properties (each of Scout, Hilcorp, IKAV, and Red Willow being a “Working Interest Owner”, and together, the “Working Interest Owners”). As used in this report, Scout refers to the current operator of the Hugoton Royalty Properties, Hilcorp refers to the current operator of the San Juan Basin - New Mexico Properties, and IKAV and Red Willow refer to the current co-operators of certain tracts of land included in the San Juan Basin - Colorado Properties, unless otherwise indicated.
The Trust is a passive entity whose purposes are limited to: (1) converting the Royalties to cash, either by retaining them and collecting the proceeds of production (until production has ceased or the Royalties are otherwise terminated) or by selling or otherwise disposing of the Royalties; and (2) distributing such cash, net of amounts for payments of liabilities to the Trust, to the unitholders. The Trust has no sources of liquidity or capital resources other than the revenues, if any, attributable to the Royalties and interest on cash held by the Trustee as a reserve for liabilities or for distribution. The Trust does not undertake or control any capital projects or make capital expenditures. While the Trust’s Royalty income is net of capital expenditures, these capital expenditures are controlled and paid by the Working Interests Owners, and the Trust receives Royalty income net of these expenses. In addition, the Trust does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or other contingent obligations.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity. As discussed in “Business - Description of the Trust” under Item 1 of this Form 10-K, the Trust’s primary source of cash is the Royalty income received from its share of the Net Proceeds from the Royalty Properties, and the only other source of cash is interest income earned pursuant to the Trust Indenture. For estimates of future Royalty income attributable to the Royalty, refer to the Notes to Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
In addition, the Working Interest Owners reimburse the Trust each quarter for certain expenses incurred by the Trust on their behalf. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were $8,565 and $23,629 of unreimbursed expenses, respectively. In accordance with the provisions of the Conveyance, generally all revenues received by the Trust, net of unreimbursed Trust administrative expenses and sums paid to or from any reserves established pursuant to the Trust Indenture, are distributed to the unitholders. The terms of the Trust Indenture provide, among other things, that the Trustee may establish cash reserves and borrow funds to pay liabilities of the Trust, and may pledge assets of the Trust to secure payment of the borrowings in accordance with the Trust Indenture. At any given time, the balance of the Contingent Reserve is included in cash and short-term investments.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Trustee increased the Contingent Reserve by (1) $22,268 of Royalty income received from BP in March 2020 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of March 2020, which Royalty income was included in the April 2020 distribution to unitholders, (2) $23,629 reimbursement not received from Scout until January 2020 but included in the December 2019 distribution to unitholders, (3) $147,893 Royalty income for February and March 2020 included in the March 2020 distribution to unitholders but not received from Scout until April 2020, (4) $583 for interest earned on the Contingent Reserve in the second quarter of 2020, (5) $7,238 of Royalty income received from BP in September 2020 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of September 2020, which Royalty income was included in the October 2020 distribution calculation, (6) $83 for interest earned on the Contingent Reserve in the third quarter of 2020, (7) $300 for an overpayment received from Hilcorp in July 2020, (8) $24 for interest earned on the Contingent Reserve in the fourth quarter of 2020, (9) $106,529 for the amount of distributable income for the fourth quarter of 2020 but withheld as cash reserves for current Trust expenses and (10) $11,990 reimbursement not received from Hilcorp in September 2020 but received in October 2020.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Trustee decreased the Contingent Reserve by (1) $844 due to an overpayment received in error from BP in December 2019 that was deducted from BP’s January 2020 payment to the Trust, (2) $147,893 Royalty income for February and March 2020 included in the March 2020 distribution to unitholders but not received from Scout until April 2020, (3) $22,268 of Royalty income received from BP in March 2020 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of March 2020, which Royalty income was included in the April 2020 distribution to unitholders, (4) $2,303 which was the difference between the amount to be paid to unitholders in July 2020 and the amount in the Trust’s operating account as of June 30, 2020, (5) $19,412, as expenses were greater than Royalty income for the three months ended September 30, 2020, (6) $11,990 for a reimbursement not received from Hilcorp until October 2020 but included in the September 2020 distribution calculation, (7) $8,565 for a reimbursement not received from Hilcorp in December 2020 but included in the December 2020 distribution calculation, (8) $751 of Royalty income not paid by BP/IKAV in November/December 2020 but included in the distribution calculation and (9) $7,238 of Royalty income received from BP in September 2020 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of September 2020, which Royalty income was included in the October 2020 distribution calculation.
The net effects of the foregoing adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2020 resulted in the balance of the Contingent Reserve being equal to $1,076,485 as of December 31, 2020.
See “Financial Review - Unreimbursed Expenses and the Contingent Reserve” for complete information about adjustments to the Contingent Reserve for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Capital Resources. The Trust is a passive entity that does not undertake or control any capital projects or make capital expenditures. While the Trust’s Royalty income is net of capital expenditures, these capital expenditures are controlled and paid by the Working Interests Owners, and the Trust receives Royalty income net of these expenses. Therefore, the Trust has no material commitments for capital expenditures.
Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
SUMMARY OF ROYALTY INCOME, PRODUCTION, PRICES AND COSTS (Unaudited)
(1)
Gross Proceeds from natural gas liquids attributable to each of the Hugoton Royalty Properties and San Juan Basin Royalty Properties are net of a volumetric in-kind processing fee retained by Scout and Hilcorp, respectively.
(2)
Royalty income is computed after deducting the Trust’s proportionate share of capital costs, operating costs and interest on any cost carryforward from the Trust’s proportionate share of Gross Proceeds. As a result of excess production costs incurred in one monthly operating period and then recovered in a subsequent monthly operating period, the Royalty income paid to the Trust may not agree to the Trust’s royalty interest in the Net Proceeds (as defined in the Conveyance). The excess production costs must be recovered by the Working Interest Owners before any distribution of Royalty income will be made to the Trust.
San Juan Basin - New Mexico Properties. Excess production costs in the amount of $18,874 and $5,321 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were related to the San Juan Basin - New Mexico Properties formerly operated by XTO, currently operated by Hilcorp. Excess production costs related to the San Juan Basin - New Mexico Properties formerly operated by XTO, currently operated by Hilcorp were approximately $13,553 and $373 for years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
San Juan Basin - Colorado Properties. Excess production costs in the amount of $36,453 and $29,597 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were related to the San Juan Basin - Colorado Properties operated by Red Willow. Excess production costs related to the San Juan Basin - Colorado Properties operated by Red Willow were approximately $6,855 and $26,641 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Hugoton Royalty Properties. Excess production costs in the amount of $430,888 and $0 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were related to the Hugoton Royalty Properties operated by Scout Energy.
(3)
Average production costs attributable to the Royalty are calculated as stated capital costs plus operating costs, divided by stated net production volumes attributable to the Royalty paid. As noted above in footnote (2), production costs may be incurred in one operating period and then recovered in a subsequent operating period, which may cause Royalty income paid to the Trust not to agree to the Trust’s Royalty interest in the Net Proceeds.
(4)
Net production volumes attributable to the Royalty are determined by dividing Royalty income by the average sales price received. Any differences noted are due to rounding.
(5)
Subject to adjustments to actual current production and costs to account for historical monthly reconciliations as they are completed by Hilcorp. See Trustee’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Operational Overview - San Juan Basin Royalty Properties under Item 7 of the Form 10-K.
Financial Review
Royalty and Interest Income. The Trust’s Royalty income was $832,149 and $1,808,378 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 was primarily a result of lower natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil and condensate prices, increased operating and capital costs for natural gas and oil and condensate and lower net natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil and condensate production volumes, partially offset by lower
operating and capital costs for natural gas liquids for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Trust’s Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $5,756 and $29,415, respectively. In accordance with the Trust Indenture and as explained below, interest on cash on hand was paid at a rate equivalent to 1.5% below the prime interest rate.
General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense was $193,947 and $202,747 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Trustee’s fees are included in general and administrative expense.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Trustee was due $475,000 for its services. The Trust paid $433,153 of this amount to the Trustee, and $41,847 was allocated to offset against interest due to the Trust under the Trust Indenture. The Trust Indenture requires that cash being held by the Trustee earn interest at 1.5% below the prime rate, which would have yielded the Trust a 3.25% annualized return from January 1, 2020 through March 2, 2020, a 2.75% annualized return from March 3, 2020 through March 14, 2020 and a 1.75% annualized return from March 15, 2020 through December 31, 2020. However, due to the current interest rate environment, the Trustee was unable to obtain an account in which such an interest rate was available. In the event such an interest rate is unavailable in the future, the Trustee intends to allocate certain of its fees due to the Trust to meet the minimum interest rate payable under the Trust Indenture. In future periods the Trustee will continue to allocate a portion of the fees earned for its services to the Trust until all remaining interest due to the Trust is fully offset.
Unreimbursed Expenses and the Contingent Reserve. The Working Interest Owners partially reimburse the Trust each quarter for amounts paid in connection with the Trustee’s services. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Trustee’s aggregate fees were $433,153 and the Working Interest Owners reimbursed the aggregate sum of $383,588 to the Trustee, which was the same amount reimbursed for the year ended December 21, 2019. As of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Trust incurred unreimbursed expenses of $8,565 and $23,629, respectively.
The terms of the Trust Indenture provide, among other things, that the Trustee may establish cash reserves and borrow funds to pay liabilities of the Trust, and may pledge assets of the Trust to secure payment of the borrowings in accordance with the Trust Indenture. The Trustee reserves the right to determine whether or not to release cash reserves in future periods with respect to any reimbursement expenses.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Trustee increased the Contingent Reserve by (1) $22,268 of Royalty income received from BP in March 2020 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of March 2020, which Royalty income was included in the April 2020 distribution to unitholders, (2) $23,629 reimbursement not received from Scout until January 2020 but included in the December 2019 distribution to unitholders, (3) $147,893 Royalty income for February and March 2020 included in the March 2020 distribution to unitholders but not received from Scout until April 2020, (4) $583 for interest earned on the Contingent Reserve in the second quarter of 2020, (5) $7,238 of Royalty income received from BP in September 2020 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of September 2020, which Royalty income was included in the October 2020 distribution calculation, (6) $83 for interest earned on the Contingent Reserve in the third quarter of 2020, (7) $300 for an overpayment received from Hilcorp in July 2020, (8) $24 for interest earned on the Contingent Reserve in the fourth quarter of 2020, (9) $106,529 for the amount of distributable income for the fourth quarter of 2020 but withheld as cash reserves for current Trust expenses and (10) $11,990 reimbursement not received from Hilcorp in September 2020 but received in October 2020.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Trustee decreased the Contingent Reserve by (1) $844 due to an overpayment received in error from BP in December 2019 that was deducted from BP’s January 2020 payment to the Trust, (2) $147,893 Royalty income for February and March 2020 included in the March 2020 distribution to unitholders but not received from Scout until April 2020, (3) $22,268 of Royalty income received from BP in March 2020 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of March 2020, which Royalty income was included in the April 2020 distribution to unitholders, (4) $2,303 which was the difference between the amount to be paid to unitholders in July 2020 and the amount in the Trust’s operating account as of June 30, 2020, (5) $19,412, as expenses were greater than Royalty income for the three months ended September 30, 2020, (6) $11,990 for a reimbursement not received from Hilcorp
until October 2020 but included in the September 2020 distribution calculation, (7) $8,565 for a reimbursement not received from Hilcorp in December 2020 but included in the December 2020 distribution calculation, (8) $751 of Royalty income not paid by BP/IKAV in November/December 2020 but included in the distribution calculation and (9) $7,238 of Royalty income received from BP in September 2020 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of September 2020, which Royalty income was included in the October 2020 distribution calculation. The net effects of the foregoing adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2020 resulted in the balance of the Contingent Reserve being equal to $1,076,485 as of December 31, 2020.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Trustee increased the Contingent Reserve by (1) $56,793 of Royalty income received from BP in March 2019 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of March 2019, which Royalty income was included in the April 2018 distribution to unitholders, (2) $434 for a duplicated general and administrative expense paid in error by the Trust in February 2019 and not refunded to the Trust until April 2019, (3) $317 underpaid by Riviera in June 2019 due to a 2018 Ad Valorem tax under accrual but included in the June 2019 distribution to unitholders, which amount was then excluded from the July 2019 distribution to unitholders, (4) $812 due to a refund received from a vendor in September 2019 and (5) $843 due to an overpayment received in error from BP in December 2019 that was deducted from BP’s January 2020 payment to the Trust.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Trustee decreased the Contingent Reserve by (1) $434 for a duplicated general and administrative expense paid in error by the Trust in February 2019 and not refunded to the Trust until April 2019, (2) $38,364 for a cash refund of a duplicate payment from a vendor received in November 2018 and distributed to unitholders in February 2019, (3) $56,794 of Royalty income received from BP in March 2019 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of March 2019, which Royalty income was included in the April 2019 distribution to unitholders, (4) $317 underpaid by Riviera in June 2019 due to a 2018 Ad Valorem tax under accrual but included in the June 2019 distribution to unitholders, which amount was then excluded from the July 2019 distribution to unitholders, (5) $812 due to a refund received from a vendor in September 2019 which refund was included in the distribution to unitholders in November 2019 and (6) and $23,629 for a reimbursement not received from Scout but included in the December 2019 distribution to unitholders. The net effects of the foregoing adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted in the balance of the Contingent Reserve being equal to $977,212 as of December 31, 2019.
Distributable Income Available for Distribution. The portion of the Trust’s distributable income available for distribution each year includes the Royalty income received from the Working Interest Owners during such period, plus interest income earned to the date of distribution (if any) and increases or withdrawals to and from the Contingent Reserve (if any). Distributable income available for distribution for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $544,685 and $1,696,197, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Trust calculated total aggregate distributions of $0.292 and $0.910 per unit, respectively.
Operational Review
Working Interest Owner and Industry Update
The business of the Working Interest Owners is being adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the containment measures being taken to mitigate its impact. The oil and gas industry has experienced sharp declines in the demand for crude oil and natural gas worldwide. The global economy and commodity prices are being severely negatively impacted, as economic activity and demand for energy have declined in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as due to other geopolitical factors. The magnitude of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on the duration and extent of the pandemic, including increases in COVID-19 case counts, any additional waves of the virus, new variants of the virus and the availability and ultimate efficacy of the vaccine on new variants of the virus. The pandemic continues to have a material adverse effect on the Working Interest Owners’ costs, operations, business and financial condition, which is having an adverse effect on Trust distributions. The Trust has not made a distribution to unitholders since the income distribution for the month of May 2020, paid to unitholders on July 31, 2020, as costs, charges and expenses attributable to the Trust’s Royalty properties, and applicable reserves, exceeded
the revenue received from the sale of oil, natural gas and other hydrocarbons produced from such properties, as reported by the Working Interest Owners. There is no indication if or when distributions may be announced in future periods.
Hugoton Royalty Properties
Royalty Income. Royalty income attributable to the Hugoton Royalty Properties for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $248,445 and $475,511, respectively. The decrease of approximately 48% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 was primarily due to lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, decreased net natural gas production volumes and higher operating and capital costs offset in part by higher net natural gas liquids production volumes from the Hugoton Royalty Properties in fiscal year 2020.
Operating Costs and Capital Expenditures. Operating costs attributable to the Hugoton Royalty Properties for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $1,388,398 and $1,155,250, respectively. The increase of approximately 20% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 was primarily due to final settlement in 2020 of the 2019 outstanding expenses related to the acquisition by Scout from the prior Working Interest Owner, Riviera. Accumulated excess production costs have increased significantly with respect to the Hugoton Royalty Properties, from $0 at December 31, 2019 to $430,888 at December 31, 2020, as reported by Scout. The Trust will not receive Net Proceeds for the Hugoton Royalty Properties until future proceeds from production exceed the total accumulated excess costs plus accrued interest during the deficit period.
Capital expenditures on these properties were $1,331 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $1 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Average Sales Prices. Average sales prices per Mcf of natural gas and Bbl for natural gas liquids for the Hugoton Royalty Properties are directly dependent on the prices Scout realizes for natural gas sold under short-term and multi-month contracts at market clearing prices to multiple purchasers.
On November 22, 2019, Riviera completed the sale of its interest in its remaining properties located in the Hugoton Basin under the Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated August 28, 2019 (the “Purchase Agreement”), by and between the Riviera Upstream, LLC, Riviera Operating, LLC and Scout Energy Group V, LP (“Scout”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Riviera divested all of its interest in its oil and gas assets and contracts in the Hugoton Royalty Properties. Since November 23, 2019, Scout has operated the Hugoton Royalty Properties.
San Juan Basin Royalty Properties
Royalty income from the San Juan Basin Royalty Properties is calculated and paid to the Trust on a state-by-state basis depending upon whether the property is situated in Colorado and New Mexico. The majority of the Royalty income from the San Juan Basin Royalty Properties is attributable to the San Juan
Basin - New Mexico Properties. Substantially all of the natural gas produced from the San Juan Basin Royalty Properties is currently being sold in the spot market.
San Juan Basin - Colorado Properties
Royalty Income. Royalty income attributable to the San Juan Basin - Colorado Properties for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $191,448 and $461,771, respectively. The decrease of approximately 59% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 was primarily due to decreased net natural gas production volumes and lower prices for natural gas, offset in part by lower operating costs from the San Juan Basin - Colorado Properties.
Operating Costs and Capital Expenditures. Operating costs attributable to the San Juan Basin - Colorado Properties for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $ 117,130 and $129,665, respectively. Accumulated excess production costs have increased with respect to the San Juan Basin - Colorado Properties operated by Red Willow, from $29,597 at December 31, 2019 to $36,453 at December 31, 2020, as reported by Red Willow. The Trust will not receive Net Proceeds for the San Juan Basin - Colorado Properties operated by Red Willow until future proceeds from production exceed the total accumulated excess costs plus accrued interest during the deficit period.
There were no capital expenditures attributable to the San Juan Basin - Colorado Properties for the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.
San Juan Basin - New Mexico Properties
Royalty Income. Royalty income attributable to the San Juan Basin - New Mexico Properties for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $392,256 and $871,096, respectively. The decrease of approximately 55% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 was primarily due to lower prices, decreased net production volumes and higher operating costs for natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil and condensate and higher capital costs for natural gas and oil and condensate for the San Juan Basin - New Mexico Properties.
Operating Costs and Capital Expenditures. Operating costs attributable to the San Juan Basin - New Mexico Properties for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $1,091,986 and $901,584, respectively. The increase of approximately 21% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 was primarily due to reconciliations completed by Hilcorp in 2020 related to prior years’ estimates. Accumulated excess production costs have increased with respect to the San Juan Basin - New Mexico Properties formerly operated by XTO, currently operated by Hilcorp, from $5,321 at December 31, 2019 to $18,874 at December 31, 2020, as reported by Hilcorp. The Trust will not receive Net Proceeds for the San Juan Basin - New Mexico Properties formerly operated by XTO, currently operated by Hilcorp, until future proceeds from production exceed the total accumulated excess costs plus accrued interest during the deficit period.
Capital expenditures on these properties for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $95,594 and $66,650, respectively. The increase of approximately 43% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as
compared to December 31, 2019 was primarily due to reconciliations completed by Hilcorp in 2020 related to prior years’ estimates. If not for the reconciliations completed in 2020, capital costs would have decreased by 54% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compare to December 31, 2019 primarily due to reduced activity in 2020 as a result of commodity price drops.
Following Hilcorp’s acquisition of ConocoPhillips’ and XTO’s interests in the San Juan Basin - New Mexico Properties, there was a transition period to transfer historical information, knowledge and processes from one owner to the other. During this transition period, Hilcorp recorded estimates of revenues and expenses and made payments to the Trust based on historical amounts previously paid by ConocoPhillips, and the Trust recognized such amounts in accordance with its modified cash basis of accounting. Accordingly, Hilcorp made an estimated monthly payment of $97,150 in Net Proceeds to the Trust from September 2017 to March 2019 based upon the July 2017 production month previously paid by ConocoPhillips. In April 2019, Hilcorp began to generate actual (instead of estimated) Net Proceeds due to the Trust on a monthly basis. Hilcorp has informed the Trust that it will utilize actual revenue and expense amounts and either add or subtract reconciled historical amounts on a month by month basis, which will be recognized over time by the Trust in accordance with the Trust’s modified cash basis of accounting. In December 2019, Hilcorp made the first payment to the Trust reconciling historical amounts for one accounting month. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, Hilcorp reconciled 10 additional historical amounts for the accounting months of October 2017 through July 2018, which resulted in a charge to the Trust of $60,262.
Until all estimated historical monthly amounts received by the Trust from September 2017 to March 2019 are fully reconciled and adjusted, Net Proceeds from the San Juan - New Mexico Properties will reflect adjustments to actual current production and costs to account for historical monthly reconciliations as they are completed. Because of anticipated future adjustments, the amounts of Net Proceeds reported for the San Juan Basin - New Mexico Properties during the year ended December 31, 2020 may not be representative of Net Proceeds that will be received in future years.
Hilcorp has informed the Trust that significant incremental costs of approximately $1.1 million attributable to the Trust were incurred in 2018 with respect to a newly drilled well in the San Juan Basin - New Mexico Properties. Incremental costs attributable to the Trust will reduce the Trust’s future Net Proceeds over a period of time as adjustments are made by Hilcorp after taking into account actual revenues as well as costs for these properties during the applicable time period. The potential impact to Net Proceeds depends upon the results of all of the reconciliation work conducted by Hilcorp and is therefore uncertain. With the assistance of a third party consultant, the Trust has undertaken a review of the reconciliation calculations by Hilcorp and the amount of Net Proceeds calculated and paid.
Pursuant to the Trust Indenture, the Trust is not required to pay to Hilcorp any amounts that could be owed if the estimated revenue exceeded actual revenue amounts or estimated expenses were less than actual expense amounts in past periods. However, Hilcorp may recover such amounts by withholding a portion or all of the Net Proceeds that would otherwise be payable to the Trust in subsequent periods. This could result in a decrease in Net Proceeds paid to the Trust and could result in future material reductions in distributions to the Trust’s unitholders.

Royalty income recorded for a month is the amount computed and paid by the Working Interest Owners to the Trustee for such month rather than either the value of a portion of the oil and gas produced by the Working Interest Owners for such month or the amount subsequently determined to be the Trust’s proportionate share of the Net Proceeds for such month;
(b)
Interest income, interest receivable and distributions payable to unitholders include interest to be earned on short-term investments from the financial statement date through the next date of distribution;
(c)
Trust general and administrative expenses, net of reimbursements, are recorded in the month they are included in the calculation of the monthly distribution amount;
(d)
Amortization of the Royalty is computed on a unit-of-production basis and is charged directly to trust corpus since such amount does not affect distributable income; and
(e)
Distributions payable are determined on a monthly basis and are payable to unitholders of record as of the last business day of each month or such later date as the Trustee determines is required to comply with applicable law or stock exchange requirements.
This basis for reporting distributable income is considered to be the most meaningful because distributions to the unitholders for a month are based on net cash receipts for such month. However, these statements differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States because, under such principles, royalty income for a month would be based on Net Proceeds from production for such month without regard to when calculated or received, general and administrative expenses would be recorded in the month they accrue, and interest income for a month would be calculated only through the end of such month.
