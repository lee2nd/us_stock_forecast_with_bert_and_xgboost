ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the information set forth under Part I, Item 1A, “Risks Factors,” and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing under Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
INTRODUCTION
Financial Institutions, Inc. (the “Parent” and together with all its subsidiaries, “we,” “our,” or “us”), is a financial holding company headquartered in New York State. We offer a broad array of deposit, lending, and other financial services to individuals, municipalities and businesses in Western and Central New York through our wholly-owned New York-chartered banking subsidiary, Five Star Bank (the “Bank”). Our indirect lending network includes relationships with franchised automobile dealers in Western and Central New York, the Capital District of New York and Northern and Central Pennsylvania. We offer insurance services through our wholly-owned subsidiary, SDN Insurance Agency, LLC (“SDN”), a full-service insurance agency. In addition, we offer customized investment advice, wealth management, investment consulting and retirement plan services through our wholly-owned subsidiaries Courier Capital, LLC (“Courier Capital”) and HNP Capital, LLC (“HNP Capital”), SEC-registered investment advisory and wealth management firms.
Our primary sources of revenue are net interest income (interest earned on our loans and securities, net of interest paid on deposits and other funding sources) and noninterest income, particularly fees and other revenue from insurance, investment advisory and financial services provided to customers or ancillary services tied to loans and deposits. Business volumes and pricing drive revenue potential, and tend to be influenced by overall economic factors, including market interest rates, business spending, consumer confidence, economic growth, and competitive conditions within the marketplace. We are not able to predict market interest rate fluctuations with certainty and our asset/liability management strategy may not prevent interest rate changes from having a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
2020 Financial Performance Review
Net income decreased $10.6 million, or 22%, to $38.3 million for 2020, compared to $48.9 million for 2019. This resulted in a 0.82% return on average assets and an 8.49% return on average equity. Net income available to common shareholders was $36.9 million or $2.30 per diluted share for 2020, compared to $47.4 million or $2.96 per diluted share for 2019. We declared cash dividends of $1.04 per common share during 2020, an increase of $0.04 per common share or 4% compared to the prior year.
Results for 2020 were negatively impacted by a higher provision for credit losses of $27.2 million, as compared to $8.0 million in 2019. The higher provision was driven by the adoption of the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) standard and uncertainty around the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economic environment.
Fully-taxable equivalent net interest income was $139.9 million in 2020, an increase of $8.8 million, or 7%, compared to 2019. The increase was the result of a $356.0 million, or 9% increase in average interest-earning assets, partially offset by a six-basis point decrease in the net interest margin, to 3.22%.
The provision for credit losses - loans was $26.2 million in 2020 compared to $8.0 million in 2019. Net charge-offs increased $2.3 million from the prior year to $13.8 million in 2020. Net charge-offs were an annualized 0.40% of average loans in the current year compared to 0.37% in 2019. In addition, non-performing loans increased $877 thousand to $9.5 million compared to a year ago and represented 0.26% of total loans at December 31, 2020.
Noninterest income totaled $43.2 million for the full year 2020, an increase of $2.8 million, or 7%, when compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily attributed to increases in income from derivatives instruments, net and net gain on sale of loans held for sale, partially offset by decreases in service charges on deposits and other noninterest income. Income from derivative instruments, net increased $3.2 million to $5.5 million in 2020 driven by an increase in the volume and value of interest rate swap transactions. Income from derivative instruments, net primarily consists of income associated with interest rate swap products offered to commercial loan customers and is based on the number and value of transactions executed. Net gain on sale of loans held for sale increased $2.5 million to $3.9 million during the current year as a result of increased volume and higher margins on residential real estate loans held for sale. Service charges on deposits decreased $2.4 million to $4.8 million during the current year primarily due to our temporary COVID-19 relief initiatives implemented in 2020, including waiving or eliminating certain fees and lower insufficient fund fees for the remainder of 2020. In addition, other noninterest income decreased $1.0 million to $4.3 million in 2020 primarily due to decreased FHLB dividends due to the lower level of FHLB borrowings in 2020 versus 2019. Lower pay-by-phone fees associated with our temporary COVID-19 consumer relief initiatives, coupled with the impact of stay-at home orders that reduced certain volume-based fees like merchant revenue and corresponding credit card fees also contributed to the decrease in other noninterest income.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Noninterest expense for the full year 2020 totaled $109.3 million, a $6.4 million increase compared to $102.8 million in the prior year. Salaries and benefits expense increased $3.0 million year-over-year, primarily as a result of higher salaries, incentives and severance expense, partially offset by a staff reduction associated with our Enterprise Standardization Program described below in the second half of the year. Computer and data processing expense increased $1.7 million year-over-year, primarily as a result of costs related to the new online and mobile platform combined with other investments in technology. Also contributing to the increase were higher FDIC assessments in 2020 and $1.5 million of restructuring charges representing non-recurring real estate charges related to the branch closings and staff reductions as part of our Enterprise Standardization Program announced in July 2020.
Income tax expense for the year was $7.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 16.2% compared to an effective tax rate of 17.8% in 2019. Effective tax rates are impacted by items of income and expense not subject to federal or state taxation. The Company’s effective tax rates differ from statutory rates primarily because of interest income from tax-exempt securities, earnings on company owned life insurance and tax credit investments placed in service.
Total assets were $4.91 billion at December 31, 2020, up $528.1 million from $4.38 billion at December 31, 2019.
Investment securities were $900.0 million at December 31, 2020, up $123.1 million from December 31, 2019. The increase from year-end 2019 was primarily due to the reinvestment of cash flow from the portfolio, coupled with the deployment of excess liquidity into cash flowing agency backed securities.
Total loans were $3.60 billion at December 31, 2020, up $374.2 million, or 12%, from December 31, 2019.
•
Commercial mortgage loans totaled $1.25 billion, an increase of $147.6 million, or 13%, from December 31, 2019.
•
Commercial business loans totaled $794.1 million, an increase of $222.1 million, or 39%, from December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to PPP loans. At December 31, 2020 the PPP loan balance was $248.0 million, net of deferred fees.
•
Residential real estate loans totaled $599.8 million, an increase of $27.5 million, or 5%, from December 31, 2019.
•
Consumer indirect loans totaled $840.4 million, a decrease of $9.6 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2019.
Total deposits were $4.28 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $722.7 million from December 31, 2019, which was primarily due to increases in the non-public demand and reciprocal deposit portfolios. Short-term borrowings were $5.3 million at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $270.2 million from December 31, 2019. The lower level of short-term borrowings in 2020 is attributable to an increase in our brokered deposits portfolio, which were utilized as a cost-effective alternative to FHLB borrowings.
Shareholders’ equity was $468.4 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $438.9 million at December 31, 2019. Common book value per share was $28.12 at December 31, 2020, an increase of $1.77, or 7%, from $26.35 at December 31, 2019. The increase in shareholders’ equity as compared to December 31, 2019, is primarily attributable to net income less dividends paid, net of the change in accumulated other comprehensive income.
The Company’s leverage ratio was 8.25% at December 31, 2020 compared to 9.00% at December 31, 2019. The Bank’s leverage ratio and total risk-based capital ratio were 8.97% and 12.63%, respectively, at December 31, 2020, compared to 9.67% and 12.47%, respectively at December 31, 2019.
Enterprise Standardization Program
The Company’s enterprise standardization program is focused on improving operational efficiency and enhancing future profitability. On July 17, 2020, in connection with the program, Five Star Bank announced changes to adopt a full-service branch model that streamlines retail branches to better align with shifting customer needs and preferences. The announcement was the result of a nine-month comprehensive assessment of all lines of business and functional areas, conducted in partnership with a leading process improvement organization. The data-driven analysis identified, among other things, overlapping service areas, automation opportunities and streamlining of processes and operations.
The July announcement included the consolidation of eleven branches into five, resulting in six branch closings and a reduction in staffing. An additional branch closure was announced in October. These actions resulted in one-time expenses related to severance and real estate related charges of approximately $1.6 million in the third quarter of 2020 and approximately $148 thousand in the fourth quarter. Expense savings of $2.7 million are anticipated on an annualized basis.
The enterprise standardization program is not yet complete as we continue to evaluate activities and functions across the organization, focusing on ways to improve operational efficiency while enhancing the employee and customer experience.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Subordinated Note Issuance
On October 7, 2020, the Company completed a private placement of $35 million of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2030, which were subsequently exchanged for subordinated notes with substantially the same terms (the “Notes”) that were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, to qualified institutional buyers and accredited institutional investors. The Notes have a maturity date of October 15, 2030, and bear interest, payable semi-annually, at the rate of 4.375% per annum, until October 15, 2025. Commencing on that date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to the then-current three-month secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) plus 426.5 basis points, payable quarterly until maturity.
The Company is entitled to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, on any interest payment date on or after October 15, 2025, and in whole at any time upon certain other specified events. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and organic growth, while a portion has been contributed to Five Star Bank to support regulatory capital ratios.
Stock Repurchase Program
On November 4, 2020, the Company announced a stock repurchase program for up to 801,879 shares of common stock, or approximately 5% of the Company’s outstanding common shares. Shares may be repurchased in open market transactions and pursuant to any trading plan adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The timing and number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, market conditions, and other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to purchase any shares and it may be extended, modified or discontinued at any time.
No shares were repurchased in 2020 under this program. In 2021, through February 28th, the Company repurchased 238,439 shares for an average repurchase price of $24.30 per share, inclusive of transaction costs.
Insurance Subsidiary Acquisition
On February 1, 2021, SDN completed the acquisition of the assets of Landmark Group (“Landmark”). A staple of the Rochester community since 1984, Landmark is an independent insurance brokerage firm delivering insurance, surety and risk management solutions across many business sectors including construction, manufacturing, real estate and technology, as well as individual personal insurance. Landmark Founder and Chairman Kelly M. Shea and President Christopher K. Shea will remain with SDN to lead SDN’s Rochester operations and continue their long-term relationship with current clients.
Operational, Accounting and Reporting Impacts Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, including our operating footprint of Western and Central New York. In response to this crisis, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was passed by Congress and signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act provided an estimated $2.2 trillion to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and stimulate the economy by supporting individuals and businesses through loans, grants, tax changes, and other types of relief. Some of the provisions applicable to the Company include, but are not limited to:
•
Accounting for Loan Modifications - The CARES Act provides that a financial institution may elect to suspend (1) the application of GAAP for certain loan modifications related to COVID-19 that would otherwise be categorized as a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) and (2) any determination that such loan modifications would be considered a TDR, including the related impairment for accounting purposes.
•
Paycheck Protection Program - The CARES Act established the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), an expansion of the Small Business Administration’s (“SBA”) 7(a) loan program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program (“EIDL”), administered directly by the SBA. On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 provided approximately $284 billion for PPP loans in an additional round of funding under the program and extended the PPP through March 31, 2021. This additional round of PPP loan funding is authorized for first-time borrowers and for second draws by certain borrowers who have previously received PPP loans.
•
Mortgage Forbearance - Under the CARES Act, through the earlier of December 31, 2020, or the termination date of the COVID-19 national emergency, a borrower with a federally backed mortgage loan that is experiencing financial hardship due to COVID-19 may request a forbearance. This relief has been extended by executive order through at least March 31, 2021.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Also, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), the National Credit Union Administration (“NCUA”), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), in consultation with the state financial regulators (collectively, the “agencies”) issued a joint interagency statement (issued March 22, 2020; revised statement issued April 7, 2020). Some of the provisions applicable to the Company include, but are not limited to:
•
Accounting for Loan Modifications - Loan modifications that do not meet the conditions of the CARES Act may still qualify as a modification that does not need to be accounted for as a TDR. The agencies confirmed with FASB staff that short-term modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were current prior to any relief are not TDRs. This includes short-term (e.g., six months) modifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or insignificant delays in payment.
•
Past Due Reporting - With regard to loans not otherwise reportable as past due, financial institutions are not expected to designate loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 as past due because of the deferral. A loan’s payment date is governed by the due date stipulated in the legal agreement. If a financial institution agrees to a payment deferral, these loans would not be considered past due during the period of the deferral.
•
Nonaccrual Status and Charge-offs - During short-term COVID-19 modifications, these loans generally should not be reported as nonaccrual or as classified.
Effective March 23, 2020 through July 9, 2020, for consumer customers, the Bank waived early CD penalty fees for withdrawals up to $20,000 (limited to one penalty-free withdrawal per CD account); eliminated all insufficient funds (overdrafts) and returned item fees; eliminated all Pay by Phone fees; waived all late fees; offered the opportunity for monthly mortgage, home equity loan or home equity line payment relief; offered the opportunity to defer unsecured consumer loans or lines of credit and secured consumer loans and lines of credit payments; and offered unsecured personal loans up to $5,000, up to 60 months at 2.95% APR subject to credit approval (additional terms and conditions may apply). In addition, ATM access fees were reinitiated on September 19, 2020.
Business customers are being faced with challenging and unique circumstances. The Bank’s relationship bankers are highly skilled in providing tailored financial solutions designed to meet the specific, individual needs of each business and they are actively reaching out to each business customer to understand how the Bank can help, given each unique business circumstance.
As of December 31, 2020, we have helped more than 1,700 customers obtain more than $270 million in loans through the PPP. Additionally, approximately 5% of our commercial loan and mortgage customers, 1% of our residential real estate loans and lines customers and less than 1% of our indirect loans customers have active payment deferrals.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED
December 31, 2020 AND December 31, 2019
Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
Net interest income is our primary source of revenue, comprising 76% of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings used to fund interest-earning and other assets or activities. Net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and by the amount and composition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the sensitivity of the balance sheet to changes in interest rates, including characteristics such as the fixed or variable nature of the financial instruments, contractual maturities and repricing frequencies.
We use interest rate spread and net interest margin to measure and explain changes in net interest income. Interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid for interest-bearing liabilities that fund those assets. The net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average earning assets. The net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread because noninterest-bearing sources of funds (“net free funds”), principally noninterest-bearing demand deposits and shareholders’ equity, also support earning assets. To compare tax-exempt asset yields to taxable yields, the yield on tax-exempt investment securities is computed on a taxable equivalent basis. Net interest income, interest rate spread, and net interest margin are discussed on a taxable equivalent basis.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The Federal Reserve influences the general market rates of interest, which impacts the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions. The intended federal funds rate, which is the cost of immediately available overnight funds, was decreased by 150 basis points due to two rate cuts in March of 2020. On March 3rd it decreased 50 basis points and on March 16th another 100 basis points, resulting in a range of 0.00% to 0.25% at year-end 2020. The Federal Reserve had previously decreased the intended federal funds rate by 25 basis points in each of August, September and October 2019, resulting in a range of 1.50% to 1.75% at year-end 2019 and increased the intended federal funds rate by 25 basis points in each of March, June, September and December 2018, resulting in a range of 2.25% to 2.50% at year-end 2018. Our loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate and changes in the prime interest rate generally follow changes in the federal funds rate. The prime interest rate, which is the rate offered on loans to borrowers with strong credit, decreased to 3.25% in March 2020, reflecting the rate cuts of 50 and 100 basis points after the previous three 25 basis point decreases in 2019 to 4.75% and four 25 basis point increases to 5.50% in December 2018.
The following table reconciles interest income per the consolidated statements of income to interest income adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):
Analysis of Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis for 2020 was $139.9 million, an increase of $8.8 million compared to $131.0 million for 2019. The increase in net interest income was due primarily to an increase in average loans of $293.1 million, or 9%, compared to 2019, partially offset by a decrease in average investment securities of $27.8 million or, 3%, compared to 2019.
Our net interest margin for 2020 was 3.22%, six-basis points lower than 3.28% from the prior year. This decrease was a function of a ten-basis point lower contribution from net free funds and a four-basis point increase in the interest rate spread. The lower interest rate spread was a net result of a 53-basis point decrease in the yield on average interest-earning assets and a 57-basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the yield on average earning interest-assets of 3.73% was 53-basis points lower than 2019. Loan yields decreased 59-basis points during 2020 to 4.18%. The yield on investment securities decreased eight-basis points during 2020 to 2.31%. Overall, the interest-earning asset rate changes decreased interest income by $20.6 million during 2020 while a favorable volume variance increased interest income by $12.8 million, which collectively drove a $7.7 million decrease in interest income.
Average interest-earning assets were $4.35 billion for 2020 compared to $3.99 billion for 2019, an increase of $356.0 million, or 9%, with average loans up $293.1 million from $3.14 billion to $3.44 billion and average securities down $27.8 million from $822.7 million to $794.9 million. The growth in average loans reflected increases in the commercial loans and residential real estate loans categories. Commercial loans, in particular, were up $309.2 million from $1.60 billion to $1.90 billion, or 19%, from 2019, primarily due to the PPP. Residential real estate loans were up $40.1 million, partially offset by decreases of $45.9 million in consumer loans and $10.3 million in residential real estate lines. Loans comprised 79.1% of average interest-earning assets during 2020 compared to 78.8% during 2019. Loans generally have significantly higher yields compared to securities and federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits and, as such, have a more positive effect on the net interest margin. The yield on average loans was 4.18% for 2020, a decrease of 59 basis points compared to 4.77% for 2019. The unfavorable rate variance resulted in a $19.4 million decrease in interest income, partially offset by a $13.0 million increase due to an increase in the volume of average loans. Securities comprised 18.3% of average interest-earning assets in 2020 compared to 20.6% in 2019. The taxable equivalent yield on average securities was 2.31% in 2020 compared to 2.39% in 2019. The decrease in the volume of average securities resulted in a $707 thousand decrease in interest income, in combination with a $593 thousand decrease due to the unfavorable rate variance.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities of 0.69% was 57 basis points lower than 2019. The cost of average interest-bearing deposits decreased 47 basis points to 0.57%, the cost of short-term borrowings decreased 71 basis points to 1.85% and the cost of long-term borrowings decreased 21 basis point to 6.09%. Overall, interest-bearing liability rate and volume decreases resulted in $16.6 million of lower interest expense during 2020.
Average interest-bearing liabilities of $3.25 billion in 2020 were $165.5 million, or 5%, higher than 2019. On average, interest-bearing deposits grew $380.7 million and noninterest-bearing demand deposits (a principal component of net free funds) were up
- 43 -
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
$184.3 million. The increase in average deposits was due to growth in non-public demand and reciprocal deposits as well as growth in brokered deposits, which were utilized as a cost-effective alternative to FHLB borrowings. For further discussion of our reciprocal and brokered deposits, refer to the “Funding Activities - Deposits” section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis. Overall, interest-bearing deposit rate and volume changes resulted in $10.7 million of lower interest expense during 2020. Average short-term and long-term borrowings were $133.9 million in 2020, $215.2 million lower than in 2019. Overall, short- and long-term borrowing rate and volume changes resulted in $5.9 million of lower interest expense during 2020.
The following tables present, for the periods indicated, information regarding: (i) the average balance sheet; (ii) the amount of interest income from interest-earning assets and the resulting annualized yields (tax-exempt yields have been adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis using the applicable Federal tax rate in each year); (iii) the amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resulting annualized rates; (iv) net interest income; (v) net interest rate spread; (vi) net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets (“net interest margin”); and (vii) the ratio of average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities. Investment securities are at amortized cost for both held to maturity and available for sale securities. Loans include net unearned income, net deferred loan fees and costs and non-accruing loans. Dollar amounts are shown in thousands.
The net interest spread, as well as the net interest margin, will be impacted by future changes in short-term and long-term interest rate levels, as well as the impact from the competitive environment. A discussion of the effects of changing interest rates on net interest income is set forth in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” included elsewhere in this report.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Rate /Volume Analysis
The following table presents, on a tax-equivalent basis, the relative contribution of changes in volumes and changes in rates to changes in net interest income for the periods indicated. The change in interest income or interest expense not solely due to changes in volume or rate has been allocated in proportion to the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each (in thousands):
Provision for Credit Losses
The provision for credit losses was $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with $8.0 million for 2019. The increase was driven by the adoption of the CECL standard, higher net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2020 and deterioration in the economic environment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which adversely impacted our unemployment forecast, the designated loss driver for our CECL model. The increase in net charge-offs during 2020 is primarily attributable to one commercial credit that was downgraded and partially charged-off during the first quarter of 2020 and for which foreclosure occurred in the third quarter of 2020. The borrower’s business was related to the hospitality industry and the downgrade and charge-off were precipitated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The provision for credit losses - loans varies based primarily on forecasted unemployment rates, loan growth, net charge-offs, collateral values associated with collateral dependent loans and qualitative factors.
See the “Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans” and “Non-Performing Assets and Potential Problem Loans” sections of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Noninterest Income
The following table summarizes our noninterest income for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):
Service charges on deposits decreased $2.4 million, or 34%, to $4.8 million in 2020, compared to $7.2 million in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to our COVID-19 relief initiatives implemented from March 23, 2020 to July 9, 2020, including waiving or eliminating certain fees. In addition, insufficient fund fees for the remainder of 2020 were lower than historic levels, potentially due to the positive impact of stimulus programs on consumer account balances. Certain ATM access fees were not reinitiated until September 19, 2020.
Insurance income decreased $167 thousand, or 4%, to $4.4 million in 2020, compared to $4.6 million in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to higher transaction revenue in the prior year as well as additional commercial account leakage.
Investment advisory income increased $348 thousand, or 4%, to $9.5 million in 2020, compared to $9.2 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to the impact of market gains, new customer accounts and increases in assets under management in existing accounts.
Income from investments in limited partnerships decreased $248 thousand, or 70%, to $104 thousand in 2020, compared to $352 thousand in 2019. We have investments in limited partnerships, primarily small business investment companies, and account for these investments under the equity method. The income from these investments fluctuates based on the maturity and performance of the underlying investments.
Income from derivative instruments, net increased $3.2 million to $5.5 million in 2020, compared to $2.3 million in 2019. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in the number and value of interest rate swap transactions executed and reflects growth and maturity of our commercial loan business.
Net gain on sale of loans held for sale increased $2.5 million to $3.9 million in 2020, compared to $1.4 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to increased volume and higher margins on residential real estate loans held for sale. The low interest rate environment has resulted in a significant increase in mortgage refinancing activity in 2020.
Net gain on investment securities was relatively flat at $1.6 million in 2020, compared to $1.7 million in 2019. The amount and timing of our sale of investment securities is dependent on several factors, including our prudent efforts to realize gains while managing duration, premium and credit risk.
A net loss on tax credit investments of $275 thousand was recognized in 2020, compared to $528 thousand in 2019. The net loss in both periods was related to tax credit investments placed in service. This loss includes the amortization of the tax credit investments, partially offset by refundable New York investment tax credits.
Other noninterest income decreased $1.0 million, or 19%, to $4.3 million in 2020, compared to $5.3 million in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to decreased FHLB dividends due to the lower level of FHLB borrowings in 2020 versus 2019 and lower pay-by-phone fees associated with our COVID-19 consumer relief initiatives. Certain of our volume-based fees like merchant revenue and corresponding credit card fees also declined as a result of the impact of stay-at-home orders in 2020.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Noninterest Expense
The following table summarizes our noninterest expense for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):
Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $3.0 million, or 5%, to $59.3 million in 2020, compared to $56.3 million in 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to higher salaries, incentives and severance, partially offset by a staff reduction in the second half of the year associated with our Enterprise Standardization Program.
Professional services expense increased $902 thousand, or 17%, to $6.3 million in 2020, compared to $5.4 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to the timing of fees for consulting and advisory projects.
Computer and data processing expense increased $1.7 million, or 17%, to $11.6 million in 2020, compared to $10.0 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to costs related to the new online and mobile platform combined with other investments in technology.
FDIC assessments increased $1.2 million to $2.2 million in 2020, compared to $1.0 million in 2019. In 2018, the FDIC minimum reserve ratio was exceeded, resulting in credits used to offset this expense in 2019 and the first quarter of 2020.
Advertising and promotions expense decreased $1.0 million, or 27%, to $2.6 million in 2020, compared to $3.6 million in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to reduced advertising activity in 2020. Advertising and promotions expense was reduced in March 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic impacted operations in Western New York.
Restructuring charges were $1.5 million in 2020, representing non-recurring real estate related charges related to the previously described branch closings associated with our Enterprise Standardization Program.
The efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 60.22% compared with 60.59% for 2019. The lower efficiency ratio is a result of the higher net interest income associated with an increase in average interest-earning assets for the year. The efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total noninterest expense by net revenue, defined as the sum of tax-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income before net gains on investment securities. An increase in the efficiency ratio indicates that more resources are being utilized to generate the same volume of income, while a decrease indicates a more efficient allocation of resources. The efficiency ratio, a banking industry financial measure, is not required by GAAP. However, the efficiency ratio is used by management in its assessment of financial performance specifically as it relates to noninterest expense control. Management also believes such information is useful to investors in evaluating Company performance.
Income Taxes
We recorded income tax expense of $7.4 million for 2020, compared to $10.6 million for 2019. In 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized tax credit investments resulting in a $1.5 million and $2.7 million reduction in income tax expense, respectively, and a $275 thousand and $528 thousand net loss recorded in noninterest income, respectively. As a result of the TCJ Act signed into law in December 2017, the Company estimated tax benefits and recorded a provisional amount in the Company’s consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company made an adjustment to the provisional amount included in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting in an expense of approximately $600 thousand recorded in the third quarter of 2019.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Our effective tax rate was 16.2% for 2020 compared to 17.8% for 2019. Effective tax rates are typically impacted by items of income and expense that are not subject to federal or state taxation. Our effective tax rates reflect the impact of these items, which include, but are not limited to, interest income from tax-exempt securities, earnings on company owned life insurance and the impact of tax credit investments. In addition, our effective tax rate for 2020 and 2019 reflects the New York State tax benefit generated by our real estate investment trust.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018
A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018, which are not included in this Form 10-K, can be found under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and are incorporated by reference herein.
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
OVERVIEW
At December 31, 2020, we had total assets of $4.91 billion, an increase of 12% from $4.38 billion as of December 31, 2019, largely attributable to organic loan growth and an increase in our investment securities portfolio. Net loans were $3.54 billion as of December 31, 2020, up $352.2 million, or 11%, when compared to $3.19 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase in net loans was primarily attributable to PPP loans in our commercial business portfolio and organic growth in our commercial and residential real estate loans. Non-performing assets totaled $12.5 million as of December 31, 2020, up $3.4 million from a year ago. Total deposits amounted to $4.28 billion as of December 31, 2020, up $722.7 million, or 20.3%, compared to December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, borrowed funds totaled $5.3 million, compared to $314.8 million as of December 31, 2019. Common book value per common share was $28.12 and $26.35 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, our total shareholders’ equity was $468.4 million compared to $438.9 million a year earlier.
INVESTING ACTIVITIES
The following table summarizes the composition of our available for sale and held to maturity securities portfolios (in thousands).
Our investment policy is contained within our overall Asset-Liability Management and Investment Policy. This policy dictates that investment decisions will be made based on the safety of the investment, liquidity requirements, potential returns, cash flow targets, need for collateral and desired risk parameters. In pursuing these objectives, we consider the ability of an investment to provide earnings consistent with factors of quality, maturity, marketability, pledgeable nature and risk diversification. Our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, guided by ALCO, is responsible for investment portfolio decisions within the established policies.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Our available for sale (“AFS”) investment securities portfolio increased $210.2 million from $417.9 million at December 31, 2019 to $628.1 million at December 31, 2020. The increase from year-end 2019 was primarily due to the reinvestment of cash flow from the portfolio, coupled with the deployment of excess liquidity into cash flowing agency backed securities. Our AFS portfolio had a net unrealized gain totaling $20.4 million at December 31, 2020 compared to a net unrealized gain of $2.1 million at December 31, 2019. The fair value of most of the investment securities in the AFS portfolio fluctuate as market interest rates change.
Impairment Assessment
For AFS securities in an unrealized loss position, we first assess whether (i) we intend to sell, or (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either case is affirmative, any previously recognized allowances are charged-off and the security's amortized cost is written down to fair value through income. If neither case is affirmative, the security is evaluated to determine whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency and any adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. Adjustments to the allowance are reported in our income statement as a component of credit loss expense. AFS securities are charged-off against the allowance or, in the absence of any allowance, written down through income when deemed uncollectible by management or when either of the aforementioned criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 no allowance for credit losses has been recognized on AFS securities in an unrealized loss position as management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality.
As of December 31, 2020, we do not have the intent to sell any of our securities in a loss position and we believe that it is not likely that we will be required to sell any such securities before the anticipated recovery of amortized cost. The unrealized losses are largely due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased. The fair value is expected to recover as the bonds approach their maturity date, repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline. We do not believe any of the securities in a loss position are impaired due to reasons of credit quality. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2020, we concluded that unrealized losses on our AFS securities are not impaired due to reasons of credit quality and no allowance for credit losses has been recognized on AFS securities. The following discussion provides further details of our assessment of the AFS securities portfolio by investment category.
U.S. Government Agencies and Government Sponsored Enterprises (“GSE”). As of December 31, 2020, there were no securities in an unrealized loss position in the U.S. Government agencies and GSE portfolio.
Agency Mortgage-backed Securities. With the exception of the non-Agency mortgage-backed securities (“non-Agency MBS”) discussed below, all of the mortgage-backed securities held by us as of December 31, 2020, were issued by U.S. Government sponsored entities and agencies (“Agency MBS”), primarily FNMA and FHLMC. The contractual cash flows of our Agency MBS are guaranteed by FNMA, FHLMC or GNMA. The GNMA mortgage-backed securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.
As of December 31, 2020, there were eight securities in the AFS Agency MBS portfolio that were in an unrealized loss position with unrealized losses totaling $68 thousand. Of these, one was in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer and had an aggregate fair value of $7.9 million and unrealized losses of less than one thousand dollars.
Given the high credit quality inherent in Agency MBS, we do not consider any of the unrealized losses as of December 31, 2020 on such Agency MBS to be credit related. As of December 31, 2020, we did not intend to sell any Agency MBS that were in an unrealized loss position, all of which were performing in accordance with their terms.
Non-Agency Mortgage-backed Securities. Our non-Agency MBS portfolio consists of positions in one privately issued whole loan collateralized mortgage obligations with a fair value and net unrealized gain of $435 thousand as of December 31, 2020. As of that date, the one non-Agency MBS was rated below investment grade. This security was not in an unrealized loss position.
Other Investments. As a member of the FHLB, the Bank is required to hold FHLB stock. The amount of required FHLB stock is based on the Bank’s asset size and the amount of borrowings from the FHLB. We have assessed the ultimate recoverability of our FHLB stock and believe that no impairment currently exists. As a member of the FRB system, we are required to maintain a specified investment in FRB stock based on a ratio relative to our capital. At December 31, 2020, our ownership of FHLB and FRB stock totaled $2.6 million and $6.1 million, respectively, and is included in other assets and recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
LENDING ACTIVITIES
Total loans were $3.60 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $374.2 million, or 12%, from December 31, 2019. Commercial loans increased $369.7 million and represented 57.0% of total loans at the end of 2020. Consumer loans increased $4.4 million to represent 43.0% of total loans at December 31, 2020. The composition of our loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale and including net unearned income and net deferred fees and costs, is summarized as follows (in thousands):
Commercial loans increased during 2020 primarily due to PPP loans in our commercial business portfolio and growth in our commercial mortgage portfolio reflecting our successful commercial business development efforts. The credit risk related to commercial loans is largely influenced by general economic conditions, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on small to mid-sized business in our market area and the resulting impact on a borrower’s operations or on the value of underlying collateral, if any.
Factors that are important to managing overall credit quality are sound loan underwriting and administration, systematic monitoring of existing loans and commitments, effective loan review on an ongoing basis, early identification of potential problems, an appropriate allowance for credit losses, and sound nonaccrual and charge off policies.
An active credit risk management process is used for commercial loans to further ensure that sound and consistent credit decisions are made. Credit risk is controlled by detailed underwriting procedures, comprehensive loan administration, and periodic review of borrowers’ outstanding loans and commitments. Borrower relationships are formally reviewed and graded on an ongoing basis for early identification of potential problems. Further analyses by customer, industry, and geographic location are performed to monitor trends, financial performance, and concentrations.
We participate in various lending programs in which guarantees are supplied by U.S. government agencies, such as the SBA, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Rural Economic and Community Development and Farm Service Agency, among others. As of December 31, 2020, the principal balance of such loans (included in commercial loans) was $282.7 million and the guaranteed portion amounted to $272.0 million. Excluding PPP Loans, the principal balance of such loans (included in commercial loans) was $29.6 million and the guaranteed portion amounted to $18.9 million. Most of these loans were guaranteed by the SBA.
Commercial business loans were $794.1 million at the end of 2020, up $222.1 million, or 39%, since the end of 2019, and comprised 22.1% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2020, compared to 17.8% at December 31, 2019. The increase in commercial business loans was primarily due to the PPP loan program administered by the SBA. As of December 31, 2020, we had $248.0 million of PPP loans, net of deferred loan fees and costs. We typically originate business loans of up to $15.0 million for small to mid-sized businesses in our market area for working capital, equipment financing, inventory financing, accounts receivable financing, or other general business purposes. Loans of this type are in a diverse range of industries. As of December 31, 2020, commercial business SBA loans including PPP loans accounted for a total of $273.8 million, or 34% of our commercial business loan portfolio.
Commercial mortgage loans totaled $1.25 billion at December 31, 2020, up $147.6 million, or 13%, from December 31, 2019, and comprised 34.9% of total loans, compared to 34.3% at December 31, 2019. Commercial mortgage loans include both owner occupied and non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans. Approximately 24% of our commercial mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was owner occupied commercial real estate. The majority of our commercial real estate loans are secured by office buildings, manufacturing facilities, distribution/warehouse facilities, and retail centers, which are generally located in our local market area. As of December 31, 2020, commercial mortgage SBA loans accounted for a total of $6.8 million or one percent of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
We determine our current lending standards for commercial real estate and real estate construction lending by property type and specifically address many criteria, including: maximum loan amounts, maximum loan-to-value (“LTV”), requirements for pre-leasing or pre-sales, minimum debt-service coverage ratios, minimum borrower equity, and maximum loan to cost. Currently, the maximum standard for LTV is 85%, with lower limits established for certain higher risk types, such as raw land which has a 65% LTV maximum.
Consumer loans totaled $1.55 billion at December 31, 2020, up $4.4 million compared to 2019, and represented 43.0% of the 2020 year-end loan portfolio versus 47.9% at year-end 2019. Loans in this classification include residential real estate loans, residential real estate lines, indirect consumer and other consumer installment loans. Credit risk for these types of loans is generally influenced by general economic conditions, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the employment income of these borrowers, the characteristics of individual borrowers, and the nature of the loan collateral. Risks of loss are generally on smaller average balances per loan spread over many borrowers. Once charged off, there is usually less opportunity for recovery on these smaller retail loans. Credit risk is primarily controlled by reviewing the creditworthiness of the borrowers, monitoring payment histories, and taking appropriate collateral and guaranty positions.
Residential real estate portfolios include conventional first lien mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit. For conventional first lien mortgages, we generally limit the maximum loan to 85% of collateral value without credit enhancement (e.g. personal mortgage insurance). A portion of our fixed-rate conventional mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market with servicing rights retained. Our conventional mortgage products continue to be underwritten using FHLMC secondary marketing guidelines. Our underwriting guidelines for home equity products include a combination of borrower FICO (credit score), the LTV of the property securing the loan and evidence of the borrower having sufficient income to repay the loan. Currently, for home equity products, the maximum acceptable LTV is 90%. The average FICO score for new home equity production was 764 and 761 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Residential real estate loans totaled $599.8 million at the end of 2020, up $27.5 million, or 5%, from the end of the prior year and comprised 16.7% and 17.8% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our residential real estate loan portfolio included $3.5 million and $5.1 million, respectively, of loans acquired during 2012 branch acquisitions. The residential real estate line portfolio amounted to $89.8 million at December 31, 2020 down $14.3 million, or 14%, compared to 2019 and represented 2.5% of the 2020 year-end loan portfolio versus 3.2% at year-end 2019. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our residential real estate line portfolio included $5.0 million and $6.2 million, respectively, of loans acquired during the 2012 branch acquisitions.
The residential real estate loans and lines portfolios had a weighted average LTV at origination of approximately 69% and 68% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Approximately 92% and 91% of the loans and lines were first lien positions at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Consumer indirect loans amounted to $840.4 million at December 31, 2020 down $9.6 million, or 1%, compared to 2019 and represented 23.4% of the 2020 year-end loan portfolio versus 26.4% at year-end 2019. The loans are primarily for the purchase of automobiles (both new and used) and light duty trucks primarily by individuals, but also by corporations and other organizations. The loans are originated through dealerships and assigned to us with terms that typically range from 36 to 84 months. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we originated $318.9 million in indirect loans with a mix of approximately 33% new vehicles and 67% used vehicles. This compares with $303.0 million in indirect loans with a mix of approximately 34% new vehicles and 66% used vehicles for the same period in 2019. We do business with over 450 franchised auto dealers located in Western, Central, and the Capital District of New York, and Northern and Central Pennsylvania. The average FICO score for indirect loan production was 712 and 722 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Other consumer loans totaled $17.1 million at December 31, 2020, up $919 thousand, or 6%, compared to 2019, and represented less than one percent of the 2020 and 2019 year-end loan portfolio. Other consumer loans consist of personal loans (collateralized and uncollateralized) and deposit account collateralized loans.
Our loan portfolio is widely diversified by types of borrowers, industry groups, and market areas within our operating footprint. Significant loan concentrations are considered to exist for a financial institution when there are amounts loaned to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. At December 31, 2020, no significant concentrations, as defined above, existed in our portfolio in excess of 10% of total loans.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Loans Held for Sale and Loan Servicing Rights. Loans held for sale (not included in the loan portfolio composition table) were entirely comprised of residential real estate loans and totaled $4.3 million and $4.2 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
We sell certain qualifying newly originated or refinanced residential real estate loans on the secondary market. Residential real estate loans serviced for others, which are not included in the consolidated statements of financial condition, amounted to $241.7 million and $189.8 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for credit losses - loans (in thousands).
- 52 -
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for credit losses - loans by loan category as of the dates indicated. The allocation is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the categories in which actual losses may occur. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the loan portfolio (in thousands).
The Company adopted ASC 326 effective January 1, 2020, which resulted in an increase to the allowance for credit losses - loans of $9.6 million and established a reserve for unfunded commitments of $2.1 million, for a total pre-tax cumulative effect adjustment of $11.7 million.
The allowance for credit losses for Pooled Loans estimate is based upon periodic review of the collectability of the loans quantitatively correlating historical loan experience with reasonable and supportable forecasts using forward looking information. Adjustments to the quantitative evaluation may be made for differences in current or expected qualitative risk characteristics such as changes in: underwriting standards, delinquency level, regulatory environment, economic condition, Company management and the status of portfolio administration including the Company’s Credit Risk Review function. The Company establishes a specific reserve for individually analyzed loans which do not share similar risk characteristics with the loans included in the forecasted allowance for credit losses. These individually analyzed loans are removed from the pooling approach discussed above for the forecasted allowance for credit losses, and include nonaccrual loans, TDRs, and other loans deemed appropriate by management. The process we use to determine the overall allowance for credit losses is based on this analysis. Based on this analysis, we believe the allowance for credit losses is adequate as of December 31, 2020.
Assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses involves substantial uncertainties and is based upon management’s evaluation of the amounts required to meet estimated charge-offs in the loan portfolio after weighing a variety of factors, including the risk profile of our loan products and customers.
Factors beyond our control, however, such as general national and local economic conditions, can adversely impact the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. As a result, no assurance can be given that adverse economic conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased losses in the portfolio or that the allowance for credit losses will be sufficient to meet actual loan losses. See Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” for the risks impacting this estimate. Management presents a quarterly review of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors based on the methodology that is described in further detail in Part I, Item I “Business” under the section titled “Lending Activities.” See also “Critical Accounting Estimates” for additional information on the allowance for credit losses.
The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is subject to ongoing management review. While management evaluates currently available information in establishing the allowance for credit losses - loans, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for credit losses - loans. Such agencies may require us to increase the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
Net charge-offs of $13.8 million in 2020 represented 0.40% of average loans compared to $11.5 million, or 0.37%, in 2019. The increase in net charge-offs was primarily due to an $8.2 million partial charge-off of an $11.9 million commercial loan downgraded in the first quarter of 2020 and for which a foreclosure occurred in the third quarter of 2020. The borrower’s business was related to the hospitality industry and the downgrade and charge-off were precipitated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The allowance for credit losses - loans was $52.4 million at December 31, 2020, compared with $30.5 million at December 31, 2019. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses - loans to total loans was 1.46% and 0.95% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The ratio of allowance for credit losses - loans to non-performing loans was 551% at December 31, 2020, compared with 353% at December 31, 2019.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Non-performing Assets and Potential Problem Loans
The following table summarizes our non-performing assets (in thousands):
Non-performing assets include non-performing loans and foreclosed assets. Non-performing assets at December 31, 2020 were $12.5 million, an increase of $3.4 million from $9.1 million at December 31, 2019. The primary component of non-performing assets is non-performing loans, which were $9.5 million or 0.26% of total loans at December 31, 2020, compared with $8.6 million or 0.27% of total loans at December 31, 2019. The increase in non-performing assets in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 is primarily due to an $11.9 million commercial loan downgraded, with $8.2 million charged-off, in the first quarter of 2020. In the third quarter of 2020, this commercial loan was recategorized as a foreclosed asset. The borrower’s business was related to the hospitality industry and the downgrade and charge-off were precipitated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Approximately $1.0 million, or 11%, of the $9.3 million of nonaccrual loans in non-performing loans as of December 31, 2020 were current with respect to payment of principal and interest but were classified as non-accruing because repayment in full of principal and/or interest was uncertain. Included in nonaccrual loans are TDRs of $200 thousand and $297 thousand at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We had no TDRs that were accruing interest as of December 31, 2020 and one TDR of $550 thousand that was accruing interest as of December 31, 2019.
Foreclosed assets consist of real property formerly pledged as collateral for loans, which we have acquired through foreclosure proceedings or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Foreclosed asset holdings represented two properties totaling $3.0 million at December 31, 2020 and three properties totaling $468 thousand at December 31, 2019.
Potential problem loans are loans that are currently performing, but information known about possible credit problems of the borrowers causes us to have concern as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan payment terms and may result in disclosure of such loans as nonperforming at some time in the future. These loans remain in a performing status due to a variety of factors, including payment history, the value of collateral supporting the credits, and/or personal or government guarantees. We consider loans classified as substandard, which continue to accrue interest, to be potential problem loans. We identified $17.9 million and $14.6 million in loans that continued to accrue interest which were classified as substandard as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
FUNDING ACTIVITIES
Deposits
The following table summarizes the composition of our deposits (dollars in thousands).
We offer a variety of deposit products designed to attract and retain customers, with the primary focus on building and expanding long-term relationships. At December 31, 2020, total deposits were $4.28 billion, representing an increase of $722.7 million for the year. The increase from December 31, 2019, was primarily due to growth in non-public demand and reciprocal deposits. Time deposits were approximately 21% and 33% of total deposits at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Nonpublic deposits, the largest component of our funding sources, totaled $2.55 billion at each of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and represented 60% and 61% of total deposits as of the end of each period, respectively. We have managed this segment of funding through a strategy of competitive pricing that minimizes the number of customer relationships that have only a single service high cost deposit account.
As an additional source of funding, we offer a variety of public (municipal) deposit products to the towns, villages, counties and school districts within our market. Public deposits generally range from 20% to 30% of our total deposits. There is a high degree of seasonality in this component of funding, because the level of deposits varies with the seasonal cash flows for these public customers. We maintain the necessary levels of short-term liquid assets to accommodate the seasonality associated with public deposits. Total public deposits were $834.9 million and $860.7 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, and represented 20% and 24% of total deposits as of the end of each period, respectively. The decrease in public deposits during 2020 was due largely to seasonality.
We participate in reciprocal deposit programs, which enable depositors to receive FDIC insurance coverage for deposits otherwise exceeding the maximum insurable amount. Through these programs, deposits in excess of the maximum insurable amount are placed with multiple participating financial institutions. Prior to the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (“EGRRCPA”) enacted on May 14, 2018, all reciprocal deposits were considered brokered deposits for regulatory reporting purposes. With the enactment of the EGRRCPA, reciprocal deposits, subject to certain restrictions, are no longer required to be reported as brokered deposits. Reciprocal deposits totaled $612.3 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $330.0 million at December 31, 2019, and represented 14% and 9% of total deposits as of the end of each period, respectively.
Brokered deposits totaled $279.6 million and $208.8 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and represented 7% and 6% of total deposits as of the end of each period, respectively.
Borrowings
The Company classifies borrowings as short-term or long-term in accordance with the original terms of the agreement. Outstanding borrowings are summarized as follows as of December 31 (in thousands):
Short-term Borrowings
Short-term FHLB borrowings have original maturities of less than one year and include overnight borrowings which we typically utilize to address short term funding needs as they arise. Short-term FHLB borrowings at December 31, 2020 consisted of $5.3 million

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
in short-term borrowings. The lower level of short-term borrowings at December 31, 2020 is attributable to an increase in our brokered deposits portfolio, which were utilized as a cost-effective alternative to FHLB borrowings. The maximum amount of short-term FHLB borrowings outstanding at any month-end during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $198.9 million. Short-term FHLB borrowings at December 31, 2019 consisted of $10.0 million in overnight borrowings and $265.5 million in short-term borrowings. The FHLB borrowings are collateralized by securities from the Company’s investment portfolio and certain qualifying loans. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s borrowings had a weighted average rate of 1.70% and 1.88%, respectively.
We have credit capacity with the FHLB and can borrow through facilities that include amortizing and term advances or repurchase agreements. We had approximately $223.5 million of immediate credit capacity with the FHLB as of December 31, 2020. We had approximately $550.3 million in secured borrowing capacity at the FRB discount window, none of which was outstanding at December 31, 2020. The FHLB and FRB credit capacity are collateralized by securities from our investment portfolio and certain qualifying loans. We had approximately $145.0 million of credit available under unsecured federal funds purchased lines with various banks as of December 31, 2020, with $226.4 million outstanding at December 31, 2020. Additionally, we had approximately $107.5 million of unencumbered liquid securities available for pledging.
The Parent has a revolving line of credit with a commercial bank allowing borrowings up to $20.0 million in total as an additional source of working capital. At December 31, 2020, no amounts have been drawn on the line of credit.
The following table summarizes information relating to our short-term borrowings (dollars in thousands).
Long-term Borrowings
On October 7, 2020, we completed a private placement of $35.0 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2030 to qualified institutional buyers and accredited institutional investors that were subsequently exchanged for subordinated notes with substantially the same terms (the “2020 Notes”) registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 2020 Notes have a maturity date of October 15, 2030 and bear interest, payable semi-annually, at the rate of 4.375% per annum, until October 15, 2025. Commencing on that date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to the then current three-month SOFR plus 4.265%, payable quarterly until maturity. The 2020 Notes are redeemable by us, in whole or in part, on any interest payment date on or after October 15, 2025, and we may redeem the Notes in whole at any time upon certain other specified events. We used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, organic growth and to support regulatory capital ratios at Five Star Bank.
On April 15, 2015, we issued $40.0 million of subordinated notes (the “2015 Notes”) in a registered public offering. The 2015 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.0% per year, payable semi-annually, for the first 10 years. From April 15, 2025 to the April 15, 2030 maturity date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an annual interest rate equal to the then current three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 3.944%, payable quarterly. After the discontinuance of LIBOR, the interest rate will be determined by an alternate method as reasonably selected by the Company. The 2015 Notes are redeemable by us at any quarterly interest payment date beginning on April 15, 2025 to maturity at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Proceeds, net of debt issuance costs of $1.1 million, were $38.9 million. The Subordinated Notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Shareholders’ Equity
Total shareholders’ equity was $468.4 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $29.4 million from $438.9 million at December 31, 2019. Net income for the year increased shareholders’ equity by $38.3 million, offset by an $8.7 million cumulative effect adjustment from the adoption of ASC 326 and common and preferred stock dividends declared of $18.1 million. Accumulated other comprehensive income included in shareholders’ equity increased $16.6 million during the year due primarily to higher net unrealized gains on securities available for sale. For detailed information on shareholders’ equity, see Note 16, Shareholders’ Equity, of the notes to consolidated financial statements. FII and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements. At December 31, 2020, both FII and the Bank exceeded all regulatory requirements. For detailed information on regulatory capital requirements, see Note 15, Regulatory Matters, of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The objective of maintaining adequate liquidity is to assure that we meet our financial obligations. These obligations include the withdrawal of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity, the repayment of matured borrowings, the ability to fund new and existing loan commitments and the ability to take advantage of new business opportunities. We achieve liquidity by maintaining a strong base of both core customer funds and maturing short-term assets; we also rely on our ability to sell or pledge securities and lines-of-credit and our overall ability to access to the financial and capital markets.
Liquidity for the Bank is managed through the monitoring of anticipated changes in loans, the investment portfolio, core deposits and wholesale funds. The strength of the Bank’s liquidity position is a result of its base of core customer deposits. These core deposits are supplemented by wholesale funding sources that include credit lines with the other banking institutions, the FHLB and the FRB.
The primary sources of liquidity for FII are dividends from the Bank and access to financial and capital markets. Dividends from the Bank are limited by various regulatory requirements related to capital adequacy and earnings trends. The Bank relies on cash flows from operations, core deposits, borrowings and short-term liquid assets.
Cash and cash equivalents were $93.9 million as of December 31, 2020, a decrease of approximately $19.0 million from $112.9 million as of December 31, 2019. During 2020, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $43.5 million and the principal source of operating activity cash flow was net income adjusted for noncash income and expense items. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $531.1 million, which included outflows of $390.9 million for net loan originations and outflows of $106.3 million from net investment securities transactions. Net cash provided by financing activities of $468.5 million was attributed to a $722.7 million increase in deposits and to proceeds from long-term borrowings, net of debt issuance costs of $34.2 million, partially offset by a $270.2 million decrease in short-term borrowings and by $18.0 million in dividend payments.
Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments
The following table summarizes the maturities of various contractual obligations and other commitments (in thousands):
(1)
Includes the maturity of time deposits amounting to $100 thousand or more as follows: $278.8 million in three months or less; $134.4 million between three months and six months; $180.1 million between six months and one year; and $12.2 million over one year.
(2)
We have committed to capital investments in several limited partnerships of up to $18.5 million, of which we have contributed $10.4 million as of December 31, 2020, including $1.2 million during 2020.
(3)
We have committed to capital investments in several tax credit investments of up to $77.5 million, of which we have contributed $22.3 million as of December 31, 2020, including $9.4 million during 2020.
(4)
We do not expect all of the commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit to be funded. Thus, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
With the exception of obligations in connection with our irrevocable loan commitments, limited partnership investments and tax credit investments as of December 31, 2020, we had no other off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. For additional information on off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Security Yields and Maturities Schedule
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the amortized cost (“Cost”), weighted average yields (“Yield”) and contractual maturities of our debt securities portfolio as of December 31, 2020. Mortgage-backed securities are included in maturity categories based on their stated maturity date. Actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities presented because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain investments. No tax-equivalent adjustments were made to the weighted average yields (dollars in thousands).
Contractual Loan Maturity Schedule
The following table summarizes the contractual maturities of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. Loans, net of deferred loan origination costs, include principal amortization and non-accruing loans. Demand loans having no stated schedule of repayment or maturity and overdrafts are reported as due in one year or less (in thousands).

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Capital Resources
The FRB has adopted a system using risk-based capital guidelines to evaluate the capital adequacy of bank holding companies on a consolidated basis. The final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (“BCBS”) capital guidelines for U.S. banks became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all of the final requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule, which were fully phased-in on January 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s capital levels remained characterized as “well-capitalized” under the new rules. We continue to evaluate the potential impact that regulatory rules may have on our liquidity and capital management strategies, including Basel III and those required under the Dodd-Frank Act. See Note 15, Regulatory Matters of the notes to consolidated financial statements and the “Basel III Capital Rules” section below for further discussion. The following table reflects the Company’s ratios and their components as of December 31 (in thousands):
(1)
Includes unrealized gains and losses related to the Company’s reclassification of available for sale investment securities to the held to maturity category.
We have elected to apply the 2020 CECL transition provision related to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on regulatory capital, as provided by the US banking agencies’ March 2020 interim final rule. Under the 2020 CECL transition provision, the regulatory capital impact of the Day 1 adjustment to the allowance for credit losses (after-tax) upon the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date has been deferred and will phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022. For the ongoing impact of CECL, we are allowed to defer the regulatory capital impact of the allowance for credit losses in an amount equal to 25% of the change in the allowance for credit losses (pre-tax) recognized through earnings for each period between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021. The cumulative adjustment to the allowance for credit losses between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021, will also phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022.
Basel III Capital Rules
Under the Basel III Rules, the current minimum capital ratios, including an additional capital conservation buffer applicable to the Company and the Bank, are:
•
7.0% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;
•
8.5% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and
•
10.5% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments were also implemented under the Basel III Rules. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s capital levels remained characterized as “well-capitalized” under the new rules.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and are consistent with predominant practices in the financial services industry. Application of critical accounting policies, which are those policies that management believes are the most important to our financial position and results, requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. Future changes in information may affect these estimates, assumptions and judgments, which, in turn, may affect amounts reported in the financial statements.
We have numerous accounting policies, of which the most significant are presented in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to consolidated financial statements. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and, in this discussion, provide information on how significant assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are reported in the consolidated financial statements and how those reported amounts are determined. Based on the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has determined that the accounting policies with respect to the allowance for credit losses, valuation of goodwill and deferred tax assets, and accounting for defined benefit plans require particularly subjective or complex judgments important to our financial position and results of operations, and, as such, are considered to be critical accounting policies as discussed below. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and judgment and are evaluated on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment. We adjust these estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Illiquid credit markets and volatile equity have combined with declines in consumer spending to increase the uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions. As future events cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from our estimates.
Adequacy of the Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of subjective measurements including, but not limited to, management’s assessment of the internal risk classifications of loans, estimating future losses utilizing current forecasts, forward-looking estimates of qualitative factors including existing economic conditions, portfolio administration, delinquency, the regulatory environment and the Company’s lending policies. Because current economic conditions and borrower strength can change, and future events are inherently difficult to predict, the anticipated amount of estimated loan losses, and therefore the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses, could change significantly. As an integral part of their examination process, various regulatory agencies also review the allowance for credit losses. Such agencies may require additions to the allowance for credit losses or may require that certain loan balances be charged off or downgraded into criticized loan categories when their credit evaluations differ from those of management, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. We believe the level of the allowance for credit losses is appropriate as recorded in the consolidated financial statements.
For additional discussion related to our accounting policies for the allowance for credit losses, see the sections titled “Allowance for Credit Losses” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
Valuation of Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in accordance with the purchase method of accounting for business combinations. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is not amortized but is tested for impairment. GAAP requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at our reporting unit level on an annual basis and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. We test goodwill for impairment as of October 1st of each year.
Impairment exists when a reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value. In testing goodwill for impairment, GAAP permits us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, no further testing is performed. However, if we conclude otherwise, we would then be required to perform a goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the difference, but not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities
The determination of deferred tax expense or benefit is based on changes in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that generate temporary differences. The carrying value of our net deferred tax assets or liabilities assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income based on estimates and assumptions (after consideration of historical taxable income as well as tax planning strategies). If these estimates and related assumptions change, we may be required to record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of income. We evaluate deferred tax assets and liabilities on a quarterly basis and assess the need for a valuation allowance, if any. A valuation allowance is established when management believes that it is more likely than not that some portion of its deferred tax assets and liabilities will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowance from period to period are included in our tax provision in the period of change. For additional discussion related to our accounting policy for income taxes see Note 19, Income Taxes, of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
Defined Benefit Pension Plan
We have a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees. For employees hired prior to December 31, 2006, who met participation requirements on or before January 1, 2008 (“Tier 1 Participant”), the benefits are generally based on years of service and the employee’s highest average compensation during five consecutive years of employment. For eligible employees who were hired on and after January 1, 2007 (“Tier 2 Participant”), the benefits are generally based on a cash balance benefit formula. Assumptions are made concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of required benefit payments, funding requirements and defined benefit pension expense. The major assumptions are the weighted average discount rate used in determining the current benefit obligation, the weighted average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increase and the estimated mortality rate. The weighted average discount rate was based upon the projected benefit cash flows and the market yields of high grade corporate bonds that are available to pay such cash flows as of the measurement date, December 31. The weighted average expected long-term rate of return is estimated based on current trends experienced by the assets in the plan as well as projected future rates of return on those assets and reasonable actuarial assumptions for long term inflation, and the real and nominal rate of investment return for a specific mix of asset classes. The current target asset allocation model for the plans is detailed in Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements. The expected returns on these various asset categories are blended to derive one long-term return assumption. The assets are invested in certain collective investment and mutual funds, common stocks, U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government agency securities, and corporate and municipal bonds and notes. The rate of compensation increase is based on reviewing the compensation increase practices of other plan sponsors in similar industries and geographic areas as well as the expectation of future increases. Mortality rate assumptions are based on mortality tables published by third-parties such as the Society of Actuaries (“SOA”), considering other available information including historical data as well as studies and publications from reputable sources. We review the pension plan assumptions on an annual basis with our actuarial consultants to determine if the assumptions are reasonable and adjust the assumptions to reflect changes in future expectations.
The assumptions used to calculate 2020 expense for the defined benefit pension plan were a weighted average discount rate of 3.09%, a weighted average long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.00% and a rate of compensation increase of 3.00%. Defined benefit pension expense in 2021 is expected to decrease to $1.9 million from the $2.4 million recorded in 2020, primarily driven by a decrease in the amount of accumulated actuarial losses to be amortized.
Due to the long-term nature of pension plan assumptions, actual results may differ significantly from the actuarial-based estimates. Differences resulting in actuarial gains or losses are required to be recorded in shareholders’ equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and amortized to defined benefit pension expense in future years. For 2020, the actual return on plan assets in the qualified defined benefit pension plan was $18.5 million, compared to an expected return on plan assets of $5.1 million. Total pretax losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2020 were $16.4 million for the defined benefit pension plan. Actuarial pretax net gains recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $2.2 million for the defined benefit pension plan.
Defined benefit pension expense is recorded in “Salaries and employee benefits” expense on the consolidated statements of income.
