General
The inclusion of supplementary analytical and related information herein may require us to make estimates and assumptions to enable us to fairly present, in all material respects, our analysis of trends and expectations with respect to our results of operations and financial position taken as a whole. Actual results may vary from the estimates and assumptions we make.
Results of Operation
Revenues
During the year ended May 31, 2021, we recognized $6,762 in revenue we received from monthly recurring revenue associated with the eBalance® treatment packages. The cost attributed to this revenue was $3,240 and included $692 in royalties we accrued on the sales.
During the year ended May 31, 2020, we recognized $19,634 in revenue, which consisted of $18,650 we received from sales of our eBalance® wellness devices, and $984 from monthly recurring revenue associated with the eBalance® treatment packages. The cost attributed to this revenue was $10,236 and included $2,243 in royalties we accrued on the sales.
During the year ended May 31, 2020, we recorded $76,190 in revenue from rights to distribute our eBalance® devices. On June 6, 2019, we entered into a letter of intent for the wholesale distribution rights to all Mainland China, not including Hong Kong (the “LOI”). As part of the LOI the potential distributor (the “Distributor”) paid a non-refundable fee of $25,000, which we amortized over the term of the LOI, and as of May 31, 2020, the full $25,000 deposit was recognized as revenue. As of May 31, 2020, the LOI expired, and we did not enter into a definitive agreement with the Distributor. In addition, at May 31, 2020, we took into income the deferred revenue associated with non-refundable deposits we received during our Fiscal 2017 year. As at May 31, 2020, the deemed right to return the devices, which we provided as part of our efforts to secure various distribution channels for our eBalance® devices and gather information for our in-house observational studies expired. Therefore, the non-refundable deposits were recorded as part of revenue from distribution rights.
As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we continue research and further development of our eBalance® Technology and devices based on this technology. During the summer of 2020, Health Canada granted our eBalance® Home and Pro Systems Class II medical device licenses, which allow us to market our eBalance® devices for wellness and pain management. Our certification with FDA continues to be ongoing; at the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K we are in the process of compiling all required documentation for a 510(K) premarket submission, which will allow us to demonstrate that the eBalance® device is at least as safe and effective as a legally marketed device available on the market. Once our eBalance devices receive the 510(K) premarket clearance, we will be able to start our commercial activity in the USA.
Operating Expenses
During the year ended May 31, 2021, our operating expenses decreased by 35.2% from $1,123,939 incurred during the year ended May 31, 2020, to $728,677 incurred during the year ended May 31, 2021. The most significant changes were as follows:
·During the year ended May 31, 2021, our consulting fees decreased by $10,834, or 3.9%, from $278,890 we incurred during the year ended May 31, 2020, to $268,056 we incurred during the year ended May 31, 2021. Larger consulting fees during the comparative year ended May 31, 2020, were associated with $25,000 we paid for consultation on setting up our distribution channels in China.
·Our research and development fees for the year ended May 31, 2021, decreased by $163,635, or 41.6%, from $393,216 we incurred during the year ended May 31, 2020, to $229,581 we incurred during the year ended May 31, 2021. The lower research and development fees during the year ended May 31, 2021, were associated with the conclusion of the work associated with Health Canada certifications, and reduced work load associated with our 510(K) submission to the FDA. In addition, we continued minor developments of the eBalance® systems.
·Our general and administrative fees for the year ended May 31, 2021, decreased by $210,424, or 53.1%, from $396,201 we incurred during the year ended May 31, 2020, to $185,777 we incurred during the year ended May 31, 2021. The two largest factors that contributed to this change were associated with fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, which, during the year ended May 31, 2021, resulted in $112,206 gain, as compared to $25,498 loss during the comparative period, and the expenditures on corporate communications, which decreased by $67,164 to $126,879 we recorded during the year ended May 31, 2021, as compared to $194,043 we incurred during the year ended May 31, 2020. Other factors that affected our general and administrative fees were associated with a $12,386 decrease to our accounting and audit fees, which decreased from $54,694 we incurred during the year ended May 31, 2020, to $42,308 for the year ended May 31, 2021. In addition, during the current period, we incurred $5,538 in marketing and
advertising fees as opposed to $17,893 we incurred during the year ended May 31, 2020. These decreases were in part offset by a $24,933 increase in professional fees, from $12,569 we incurred during the year ended May 31, 2020, to $37,502 we incurred during the year ended May 31, 2021 and by $900 increase to our management fees, which increased from $39,600 we incurred during the year ended May 31, 2020, to $40,500 we incurred during the year ended May 31, 2021.
·During the year ended May 31, 2021, we recognized $42,568 (May 31, 2020 - $Nil) as impairment of our inventory of eBalance® devices and additional supplies included in work in progress inventory, as we were not certain that the costs will be recovered.
·During the year ended May 31, 2021, we incurred $261 in distribution expenses we paid or accrued to our sales representatives (May 31, 2020- $53,786). Based on our agreements with the sales representatives, we agreed to pay CAD$350 as commission for each eBalance® device they sell. In order to allow our sales representatives to establish their customer base, during the year ended May 31, 2020, we were paying a monthly fee of CAD$5,000 to each sales representative. Due to a delay in securing Health Canada Class II device licenses as well as FDA approval, we suspended our agreements with the sales representatives in January 2020. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K the agreements with the sales representatives continue to be suspended.
Other Items
During the year ended May 31, 2021, we accrued $32,020 (May 31, 2020 - $21,069) in interest associated with the outstanding notes payable, of which $3,677 (May 31, 2020 - $8,427) were accrued on the notes payable we issued to Mr. Jeffs, our major shareholder.
During the year ended May 31, 2020, we recorded $102,094 loss on reacquisition of distribution rights from Live Current Media Inc. We did not have similar expenses during the year ended May 31, 2021.
On May 3, 2021, we entered into letter agreements with certain of our debt holders to convert a total of $481,327 we owed them under 6% notes payable, including $32,677 in accrued interest on these notes payable, and $48,250 we owed under non-interest-bearing advances payable into 2,484,500 common shares of the Company at a deemed price of $0.20 per share. At the time of conversion, our common shares were valued at $0.275, therefore we recorded $153,661 as loss on conversion of debt. We did not have similar transactions during the year ended May 31, 2020.
During the year ended May 31, 2020, we recognized $68,816 as gain on forgiveness of debt, when two vendors agreed to forgive the amounts we owed them for the services provided in our fiscal 2015.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Working Capital
As of May 31, 2021, we had a cash balance of $20,753, a working capital deficit of $1,577,253 and cash flows used in operations of $560,432 for the period then ended. During the year ended May 31, 2021, we funded our operations with $207,000 received from our private placement financings and $328,096 we received in exchange for notes payable, which accumulate interest at 6% per annum, compounded monthly, and are due on demand.
We did not generate sufficient cash flows from our operating activities to satisfy our cash requirements for the year ended May 31, 2021. The amount of cash we have generated from our operations to date is significantly less than our current debt obligations. There is no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash from our operations to repay the amounts owing under the outstanding notes and advances payable, or to service our other
debt obligations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to repay the amounts owing when due, we may be required to raise additional financing from other sources. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time and raises substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern.
Cash Flows
Net Cash Used in Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended May 31, 2021, was $560,432. This cash was primarily used to cover our cash operating expenses of $780,825. This use of cash was offset by $138,177 increase in amounts due to related parties, $54,080 increase in our accounts payable, and $25 increase in our accrued liabilities; our other current assets decreased by $15,397, and our inventory decreased by $12,714.
Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended May 31, 2020, was $925,844. This cash was primarily used to cover our cash operating expenses of $943,839, to decrease our unearned revenue by $57,904, and amounts due to related parties by $16,518. These uses of cash were offset by decreases in our inventory and other current assets of $20,503 and $16,152, respectively, and by $46,574 and $9,188 increases in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities, respectively.
Non-cash transactions
During the years ended May 31, 2021 and 2020, our net loss was affected by the following expenses that did not have any impact on cash used in operations:
·$42,568 (May 31, 2020 - $Nil) in impairment of our inventory of eBalance® devices and additional supplies required for manufacturing as we were not certain that the costs will be recovered;
·$32,020 (May 31, 2020 - $21,069) in interest we accrued on the outstanding notes payable. Of this interest, $3,677 (2020 - $8,427) was accrued on the notes payable we issued to Mr. Jeffs;
·$2,434 (May 31, 2020 - $1,846) in amortization of equipment we acquired for our manufacturing operations and for our office;
·$18,333 (May 31, 2020 - $3,667) in non-cash investor relations expenses which were associated with fair market value of the shares we issued to our consultant in April 2020 for investor relation services; and
·$153,661 in loss on conversion of debt (May 31, 2020 - $Nil) associated with letter agreements we entered into with certain of our debt holders, who agreed to convert a total of $481,327 we owed them under 6% notes payable, including $32,677 in accrued interest on these notes payable, and $48,250 we owed under non-interest-bearing advances payable into 2,484,500 common shares of the Company at a deemed price of $0.20 per share. At the time of conversion, our common shares were valued at $0.275, which resulted in a loss on conversion.
The above expenses were in part offset by $119,005 gain (May 31, 2020 - $20,183 loss) in unrealized foreign exchange, which resulted from fluctuations of Canadian dollar in relation to US dollar, our functional and reporting currency.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
During the year ended May 31, 2021, we used $1,574 to purchase additional office equipment (2020 - $2,463).
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities
During the year ended May 31, 2021, we received $328,096 under loan agreements, which are payable on demand and accumulate interest at 6% per annum. In addition, we received $167,000 on closing of our non-brokered private placement for 988,000 units of our common stock at $0.25 per unit for total proceeds of $247,000, of which $80,000 was received during the year ended May 31, 2020, and $40,000 on closing of our non-brokered private placement for 200,000 shares of our common stock at $0.20 per share. We did not incur any share-issuance costs associated with the private placement financings we closed during the year ended May 31, 2021.
During the year ended May 31, 2020, we received $327,650 under convertible loan agreements, which were payable on demand and accumulated interest at 6% per annum. At discretion of the lenders, the amounts due under the loans could have been converted into the units of our common stock at the then-current price of private placement financing. In addition, we received a total of $15,000 in non-interest-bearing advances which were payable on demand. These loans and advances were converted to shares of our common stock during the year ended May 31, 2021.
In addition, during the year ended May 31, 2020, we received $7,772 related to the recovery of short-swing profits under Section 16(b) of the Act, and $486,000 on issuance of 4,050,000 units of our common stock, and $80,000 on subscription to units of our common stock, which were issued on July 30, 2020. We did not incur any share-issuance costs associated with the units issued as part of the private placement financing.
Going Concern
The notes to our audited consolidated financial statements at May 31, 2021, disclose our uncertain ability to continue as a going concern. Our current business operations are in an early development stage and as such, we were able to generate only minimal revenue from the operations. Our research and development plans for the near future will require large capital expenditures, which we are planning to mitigate through equity or debt financing, or by requiring upfront deposits from our potential distributors, once we begin commercial production of our eBalance® devices.
As at May 31, 2021, we had accumulated a deficit of $8,960,356 since inception and increased sales will be required to fund and support our operations. Our continuation as a going concern depends upon the continued financial support of our shareholders, our ability to obtain necessary debt or equity financing to continue operations, and the attainment of profitable operations. Our audited consolidated financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments that would be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern and therefore be required to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in other than the normal course of business and at amounts different from those reflected in our financial statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
None.
Critical Accounting Policies
An appreciation of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results. These policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties, and as a result, such estimates may significantly impact our financial results. The precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. We have applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently.
Principals of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cell MedX Corp. and our Subsidiary. On consolidation we eliminate all intercompany balances and transactions.
Foreign currency translations and transactions
Our functional and reporting currency is the United States dollar. We translate foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities into their U.S. dollar equivalents using foreign exchange rates which prevailed at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the period. Related translation adjustments as well as gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are reported as part of operating expenses on the statement of operations.
The functional currency of our Subsidiary is the Canadian dollar. On consolidation, the Subsidiary translates the assets and liabilities to U.S. dollars using foreign exchange rates which prevailed at the balance sheet date, and translates revenues and expenses using average exchange rates during the period. Gains and losses arising on settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the other comprehensive income. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K we have not entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that is expected to be received by the Company for providing goods or services under a contract with a customer, which is initially estimated with pricing specified in the contract and adjusted primarily for sales returns, discounts and other credits at contract inception then updated each reporting period, and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of a contract with a customer exists and a performance obligation is identified and satisfied as the customer obtains control of the goods or services. The Company recognizes revenue on the monthly eBalance® treatment packages in the month the packages are provided.
Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are in included in cost of revenues.
Inventory valuation
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, net of trade discounts received, with costs being determined based on the weighted average cost basis.
Research and development costs
The Company expenses all in-house research and development costs in the period they were incurred. Acquired research and development costs are capitalized to the extent that the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset can be reasonably estimated or may be verified by an appraisal in certain instances. In all other instances the costs are expensed in the period they were incurred. Acquired research and development costs for a particular research and development project that have no future economic values, are expensed as research and development costs at the time the costs are incurred.
Income taxes
Income tax expense is based on pre-tax financial accounting income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets, including tax loss and credit carry forwards, and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred income tax expense represents the change during the period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and non-current based on their characteristics. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Loss per share
Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to the common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net income per common share includes the potential dilution that could occur upon exercise of the options and warrants to acquire common stock computed using the treasury stock method which assumes that the increase in the number of shares is reduced by the number of shares which could have been repurchased by the Company with the proceeds from the exercise of the options and warrants.
Long-lived assets
In accordance with ASC 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment”, the Company tests long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset, as well as specific appraisal in certain instances. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds fair value.
Equipment
Equipment is stated at cost and is amortized over its estimated useful life on a straight-line basis over two years.
Fair value measurements
The book value of cash, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, notes and advances payable, and due to related parties approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturity of those instruments. The fair value hierarchy under GAAP is based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value which are the following:
Level 1 -quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 -observable inputs other than Level 1, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, and model-derived prices whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable; and
Level 3 -assets and liabilities whose significant value drivers are unobservable by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). There were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the periods ended May 31, 2021 and 2020.
Stock options and other stock-based compensation
The Company accounts for the granting of share purchase options to employees using the fair value method whereby all awards to employees are recorded at fair value on the date of the grant. The fair value of all share purchase options is expensed over their vesting period with a corresponding increase to additional capital surplus. Upon exercise of share purchase options, the consideration paid by the option holder, together with the amount previously recognized in additional paid-in capital is recorded as an increase to share capital.
The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of share purchase options. Option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected price volatility. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate.
Recent accounting pronouncements
Recent accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other authoritative standards groups with future effective dates are either not applicable or are not expected to be significant to the financial statements of the Company.
