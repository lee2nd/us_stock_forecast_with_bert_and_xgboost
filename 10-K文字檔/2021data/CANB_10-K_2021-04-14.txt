Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation
General
Can B̅ Corp. was originally formed as a Florida corporation on October 11, 2005, under the name of WrapMail, Inc. Effective January 5, 2015, we acquired 100% ownership of Prosperity Systems, Inc., which the Company is in the process of dissolving. Effective December 28, 2018, we acquired 100% ownership of Pure Health Products. In November 2018, we formed Duramed as a wholly-owned subsidiary. The Company is presently in the process of dissolving Prosperity.
We manufacture and sell products containing CBD. We also provide document, project, marketing and sales management systems to our residual business clients through our website and proprietary software, which divisions are being wound-down. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CANB and its wholly-owned subsidiary Pure Health Products from the date of its acquisition on December 28, 2018. Duramed Inc. results reflect their first full year of operation in 2020 and reflect the general downturn in the elective surgery business due to COVID. Green Grow Farms was essentially dormant as it has produced sufficient biomass which was converted into isolate to supply Pure Health products for most of 2021’s anticipated production.
Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2020 compared with Year Ended December 31, 2019:
Revenues decreased $595,834 from $2,305,503 in 2019 to $1,709,669 in 2020. The decrease was due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Essentially, nationally elective surgeries were curtailed in favor of emergency use of all operating rooms and facilities, which dramatically curtailed the use of our ultrasound device associated with patient recovery. Additionally, distributor and medical office sales of our main-line CBD products such as tinctures and salves, were diminished due to closing and limited access to medical office facilities, again directly tied to the COVID pandemic.
Cost of product sales decreased $320,522 from $598,584 in 2019 to $278,062 in 2020 due to an oversupply of Hemp and CBD biomass in the market.
Officers and director’s compensation and payroll taxes decreased $561,998 from $2,639,711 in 2019 to $2,077,713 in 2020.

Reimbursed expenses decreased $154,867 from $242,585 in 2019 to $87,718 in 2020.
Other operating expenses increased $209,334 from $667,097 in 2019 to $876,431 in 2020. The increase was due largely to higher commission fees, supplies expense and office expense in 2020 compared to 2019.
Net loss decreased $184,249 from $5,900,760 in 2019 to $5,716,511 in 2020. The increase was due to the $1,793,311 decrease in total operating expenses offset by the $1,332,530 increase in other expense - net, the $1,220 increase in provision for income taxes and the $275,312 decrease in gross profit.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2020, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $457,798 and a working capital of $1,792,668. Cash and cash equivalents increased $411,258 from $46,540 at December 31, 2019 to $457,798 at December 31, 2020.

The Company currently has no agreements, arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources.
We currently have no commitments with any person for any capital expenditures.
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. It is anticipated that Green Grow will again begin operations later in 2021 as Pure Health Products revenue increases and the need for additional isolate is present. Today, the available oversupply of isolate makes it cheaper to buy quality product at the market than to grow, harvest, and extract from scratch. Duramed, Inc. is beginning to show improvements in office utilization of its ultrasound device as more surgery centers are reopening.
