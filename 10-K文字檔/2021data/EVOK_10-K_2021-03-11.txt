Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis, or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
We are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development and commercialization of drugs to treat GI disorders and diseases. Since our inception, we have devoted our efforts to developing our sole product, Gimoti (metoclopramide) nasal spray, the first and only nasally-administered product indicated for the relief of symptoms in adults with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis. On June 19, 2020, we received approval from FDA for our NDA for Gimoti. We launched commercial sales of Gimoti in the United States in October 2020 through our commercial partner Eversana.
Diabetic gastroparesis is a GI disorder affecting millions of patients worldwide, in which food in an individual’s stomach takes too long to empty resulting in a variety of serious GI symptoms and system metabolic complications. The gastric delay caused by gastroparesis can compromise absorption of orally administered medications.
On January 21, 2020, we entered into the Eversana Agreement for the commercialization of Gimoti. Pursuant to the Eversana Agreement, Eversana commercializes and distributes Gimoti in the United States. Eversana also manages the marketing of Gimoti to targeted health care providers, as well as the sales and distribution of Gimoti in the United States. Eversana also provided a $5 million revolving credit facility that became available upon FDA approval of the Gimoti NDA. In June 2020 we borrowed $2 million and in December 2020 we borrowed the remaining $3 million under the Eversana Credit Facility.
We have primarily funded our operations through the sale of our convertible preferred stock prior to our initial public offering in September 2013, borrowings under our bank loans and the sale of shares of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We launched commercial sales of Gimoti in late October 2020 with Eversana and, to date, have generated modest sales given the launch occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic and we were entering the holiday season.
We have incurred losses in each year since our inception. These operating losses resulted from expenses incurred in connection with advancing Gimoti through development activities and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur operating losses until revenues from sales of Gimoti exceed our expenses, if ever. We may never become profitable, or if we do, we may not be able to sustain profitability on a recurring basis.
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $8.1 million, which excludes our receipt of approximately $13.1 million in net proceeds raised from our public offering of our common stock in January 2021. Current cash on hand is intended to fund commercialization activities for Gimoti, manufacture commercial batches of Gimoti, conduct the post-marketing commitment PK trial of Gimoti and any additional development activities should we seek additional indications, protect our intellectual property portfolio and for general and administrative costs to support operations. Our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. We believe, based on our current operating plan, that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020, along with the net proceeds raised from our public offering in January 2021, will be sufficient to fund our operations into the first quarter of 2022, excluding future Gimoti revenue. This period could be shortened if there are any significant increases in planned spending other than anticipated. We anticipate that we will be required to raise additional funds in order to continue as a going concern. Because our business is entirely dependent on the success of Gimoti, if we are unable to secure additional financing or identify and execute on other development or strategic alternatives for Gimoti or our company, we will be required to curtail all of our activities and may be required to liquidate, dissolve or otherwise wind down our operations. Any of these events could result in a complete loss of your investment in our securities.
Impact of COVID-19
Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, we began our commercial sales of Gimoti with Eversana in October 2020. We have experienced various disruptions to our sales activities, but have continued our efforts to reach physicians and customers. For example, Eversana’s commercialization efforts have been adversely affected by operational restrictions imposed on its sales force from quarantines, travel restrictions and bans, and other governmental restrictions related to COVID-19. As a result of these restrictions, their sales force has been restricted from conducting in-person interactions with certain physicians and customers and has been restricted to conducting educational and promotional activities for Gimoti virtually in certain circumstances, which has impacted Eversana’s ability to more actively market Gimoti. Research conducted by IOVIA stated that as a result of COVID-19, fewer patients are visiting physician offices resulting in lower patient volumes than normal,
and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported during 2020 that over 40% of patients were avoiding care due to COVID-19. We anticipate that we and Eversana will continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The COVID-19 pandemic has not significantly disrupted the operations of our third-party suppliers and manufacturers or delayed our manufacturing timelines of Gimoti, but may negatively impact our ability to successfully commercialize Gimoti and generate product sales in the future. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation measures have also had an adverse impact on global economic conditions which could have an adverse effect on our future business and financial condition, including impairing our ability to raise capital when needed.
In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES, Act was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, we applied for and were approved for a Small Business Administration, or SBA, loan under the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, established by the CARES Act. On May 1, 2020, we received the loan proceeds of approximately $104,000. In January 2021, we received notice that our loan and accrued interest were forgiven by the SBA.
Technology Acquisition Agreement
In June 2007, we acquired all worldwide rights, data, patents and other related assets associated with Gimoti from Questcor Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Questcor, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. We paid Questcor $650,000 in the form of an upfront payment and $500,000 in May 2014 as a milestone payment based upon the initiation of the first patient dosing in our Phase 3 clinical trial for Gimoti. In August 2014, Mallinckrodt, plc, or Mallinckrodt, acquired Questcor. As a result of that acquisition, Questcor transferred its rights included in the asset purchase agreement with us to Mallinckrodt. In addition to the payments previously made to Questcor, we may be required to make additional milestone payments totaling up to $52 million. In March 2018, we amended the asset purchase agreement with Mallinckrodt to defer development and approval milestone payments, such that rather than paying two milestone payments based on FDA acceptance for review of the NDA and final product marketing approval, we would be required to make a single $5 million payment on the one-year anniversary after we receive FDA approval to market Gimoti. At the time of the Gimoti NDA approval by FDA, we recorded the $5 million payable owed to Mallinckrodt with a due date of June 19, 2021, along with a $5 million research and development expense.
The remaining $47 million in milestone payments depend on Gimoti’s commercial success. We will be required to pay to Mallinckrodt a low single digit royalty on net sales of Gimoti. Our obligation to pay such royalties will terminate upon the expiration of the last patent right covering Gimoti, which is expected to occur in 2030, subject to possible extension should any additional, later expiring, licensed patents be granted.
Financial Operations Overview
Revenue Recognition
Our ability to generate revenue and become profitable depends on our ability to successfully commercialize Gimoti, which we launched in the United States through prescription in October 2020 through our commercial partner Eversana. If we or Eversana fail to successfully launch Gimoti and grow and maintain sales, we may never generate significant revenues and our results of operations and financial position will be adversely affected.
In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, we recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods provided. Customer control is determined upon the customer’s physical receipt of the product. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: identify the contracts with the customer; identify the performance obligations in the contract; determine the transaction price; allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and recognize revenue when (or as) it satisfies a performance obligation. At contract inception, we assess the goods promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations and assess whether each promised good is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when the customer obtains control of the product.
Product sales are recorded at the transaction price, which includes variable considerations for co-payment assistance to commercially insured patients meeting certain eligibility requirements, as well as to uninsured patients. Co-payment assistance is recorded as an offset to gross revenue at the time revenue from the product sale is recognized based on expected and actual program participation.
Co-pay liabilities are estimated using prescribing data available from customers. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results in the future vary from estimates, we will adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.
Liabilities for co-pay assistance are classified as accounts payable and accrued expenses in the balance sheets.
Research and Development Expenses
We expense all research and development expenses as they are incurred. Research and development expenses primarily include:
●
clinical and regulatory-related costs;
●
expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs;
●
manufacturing and stability testing costs and related supplies and materials; and
●
employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense.
All of our research and development expenses to date have been incurred in connection with the development of Gimoti. With FDA approval of Gimoti, we expect research and development costs to decrease and shift to commercialization and selling costs. However, we have initiated planning for an FDA post-marketing commitment PK trial of Gimoti. This trial will be designed to characterize dose proportionality of a lower dosage strength of Gimoti to accommodate patients that may require further dosage adjustments. We are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur related to this trial, or the regulatory review of such lower dosage of Gimoti, though such costs may be significant. Clinical development timelines, the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations.
The costs of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project owing to, but not limited to, the following:
●
per subject trial costs;
●
the number of sites included in the trials;
●
the length of time required to enroll eligible subjects;
●
the number of subjects that participate in the trials;
●
the number of doses that subjects receive;
●
the cost of comparative agents used in trials;
●
the drop-out or discontinuation rates of subjects;
●
potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies; and
●
the duration of patient follow-up.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, including stock-based compensation. Other general and administrative expenses include professional fees for accounting, tax, patent costs, legal services, insurance, facility costs and costs associated with being a publicly-traded company, including fees associated with investor relations and directors and officers liability insurance premiums. We expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we continue to progress with the commercialization of Gimoti and we reimburse Eversana from the net profits attained from the sales of Gimoti.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical for fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation expense for stock option grants and employee stock purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, is recorded at the estimated fair value of the award as of the grant date and is recognized as expense
on a straight-line basis over the employee’s requisite service period, except awards with a performance condition. Awards with a performance condition commence vesting when the satisfaction of the performance condition is probable. The estimation of stock option and ESPP fair value requires management to make estimates and judgments about, among other things, employee exercise behavior, forfeiture rates and volatility of our common stock. The judgments directly affect the amount of compensation expense that will be recognized.
We grant stock options to purchase common stock to employees and members of the board of directors with exercise prices equal to our closing market price on the date the stock options are granted. The risk-free interest rate assumption was based on the yield of an applicable rate for U.S. Treasury instruments with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued. The weighted-average expected term of options and employee stock purchases was calculated using the simplified method as prescribed by accounting guidance for stock-based compensation. This decision was based on the lack of relevant historical data due to our limited historical experience. In addition, due to our limited historical data, the estimated volatility was calculated based upon our historical volatility and, if necessary, supplemented with historical volatility of comparable companies in the biotechnology industry whose share prices are publicly available for a sufficient period of time. The assumed dividend yield was based on our history of never paying cash dividends and having no expectation of paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We account for forfeitures as the forfeitures occur.
We granted options to purchase 1,172,000 and 829,500 shares of common stock in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, in June 2019, we effected a one-time option exchange, wherein employees were offered the opportunity to exchange certain outstanding stock options for the grant of a lesser number of replacement stock options. The participants received three new stock options for every four stock options tendered for exchange. As a result, 2,456,999 stock options were exchanged for 1,842,746 replacement options.
Other Information
Net Operating Loss Carryforwards
As of December 31, 2020, we had federal and California tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $81.3 million and $47.7 million, respectively. The federal and California net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2027 and 2028, respectively, unless previously utilized. The portion of federal net operating losses created after 2017 of approximately $19.5 million do not expire and will carry forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2020, we also had federal and California research and development tax credit carryforwards of $2.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively. The federal research and development tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2027 unless previously utilized. The California research and development tax credit will carry forward indefinitely. Furthermore, under the U.S. tax legislation enacted in December 2017, although the treatment of tax losses generated before December 31, 2017 has generally not changed, tax losses generated in calendar year 2018 and beyond do not expire, but may only offset 80% of our taxable income. This change may require us to pay federal income taxes in future years despite generating a loss for federal income tax purposes in prior years.
Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change” (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have not completed our analysis to determine what, if any, impact any prior ownership change has had on our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards.

Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by approximately $3.1 million. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily due to recording a $5 million expense in June 2020 upon achieving a technology acquisition milestone related to FDA’s approval of Gimoti. Although the expense was recorded when incurred, the payment is not due to Mallinckrodt until June 19, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we also incurred expenses responding to requests for additional information from FDA related to the NDA and preparing for future manufacturing and the commercial launch of Gimoti. Excluding the Mallinckrodt milestone expense, research and development expenses decreased during 2020 as we have shifted our focus to commercialization and selling activities. Costs incurred in 2020 included approximately $832,000 for wages, taxes and employee insurance, including approximately $317,000 of stock-based compensation expense,
and approximately $625,000 related to acquiring raw material prior to obtaining FDA approval of Gimoti and to continued testing of Gimoti batches that were manufactured prior to FDA approval.
In 2019, we incurred expenses primarily related to responding to requests for additional information from FDA and manufacturing registration batches of Gimoti as required by FDA. Costs incurred in 2019 included approximately $2.1 million for wages, taxes and employee insurance, including approximately $710,000 of stock-based compensation expense, approximately $945,000 related to manufacturing, and approximately $286,000 related to responding to FDA information requests regarding the NDA and preparing for the NDA resubmission.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by approximately $2.7 million. Costs incurred in 2020 primarily included approximately $3.5 million for wages, taxes and employee insurance, including approximately $1.3 million of stock-based compensation expense, approximately $2.4 million for legal, accounting, directors and officers liability insurance and other costs associated with being a public company, approximately $296,000 related to pre-commercialization and commercialization activities and $173,000 for facility-related expenses. Of the total selling, general and administrative expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately $2.0 million related to wages, taxes, employee insurance, stock-based compensation, pre-commercialization and commercialization activities were selling-based expenses. Costs incurred in 2019 primarily included approximately $1.7 million for wages, taxes and employee insurance, including approximately $664,000 of stock-based compensation expense, approximately $1.6 million for legal, accounting, directors and officers liability insurance and other costs associated with being a public company, approximately $165,000 for facility-related expenses, approximately $132,000 for outside consultants, and approximately $68,000 for pre-commercialization costs.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since our inception in 2007, we have funded our operations primarily from the sale of equity securities and borrowings under loan and security agreements. Prior to our IPO, we received $17.7 million in net proceeds from the sale of our Series A convertible preferred stock and advances of $5.5 million under the loan and security agreements. During 2013, we completed our IPO and raised approximately $25.1 million, net of offering costs and commissions.
In November 2017, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC on Form S-3. The shelf registration statement included a prospectus for an at-the-market offering to sell up to an aggregate of $16.0 million of shares of our common stock through FBR as a sales agent, pursuant to a sales agreement with FBR, or the FBR Sales Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 1,490,813 shares of common stock at a weighted-average price per share of $2.46 pursuant to the FBR Sales Agreement and received proceeds of approximately $3.6 million, net of commissions and fees. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold 7,004,381 shares of common stock at a weighted-average price per share of $0.89 pursuant to the FBR Sales Agreement and received proceeds of approximately $6.1 million, net of commission and fees. Effective January 6, 2021, we terminated the FBR Sales Agreement.
Under current SEC regulations, if at the time we file our Annual Report on Form 10-K our public float is less than $75 million, and for so long as our public float remains less than $75 million, the amount we can raise through primary public offerings of securities in any twelve-month period using shelf registration statements is limited to an aggregate of one-third of our public float, which is referred to as the baby shelf rules. As of the date we filed this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our public float exceeded $75 million, thereby allowing us to conduct primary offerings without being constrained by the baby shelf rules. We will remain unconstrained by the baby shelf rules under our Form S-3 shelf registration statement until the date we file a new registration statement or our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021, at which time if our public float is less than $75 million, the number of securities we may sell under a Form S-3 registration statement will again be limited by the baby shelf rules.
In December 2020, we filed a new shelf registration statement with the SEC on Form S-3, or the replacement shelf registration statement. The replacement shelf registration statement replaced the registration statement on Form S-3 we originally filed with the SEC in November 2017, which registration statement expired in December 2020. The replacement shelf registration was declared effective by the SEC on January 6, 2021. In December 2020, we also entered into the ATM Sales Agreement with FBR and H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC pursuant to which we may sell from time to time, at our option, up to an aggregate of $30 million worth of shares of our common stock through the Sales Agents. The ATM Sales Agreement provides, among other things, that sales under the ATM Sales Agreement will be made pursuant to the registration statement, including the base prospectus filed as part of such registration statement.
Future sales under the ATM Sales Agreement will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and our capital needs. There can be no assurance that the Sales Agents will be successful in consummating future sales based on prevailing market conditions or in the quantities or at the prices that we deem appropriate.
In addition, we will not be able to make future sales of common stock pursuant to the ATM Sales Agreement unless certain conditions are met, which include the accuracy of representations and warranties made to the Sales Agents under the ATM Sales Agreement. Furthermore, each of the Sales Agents is permitted to terminate the ATM Sales Agreement with respect to itself in its sole discretion upon ten days’ notice, or at any time in certain circumstances, including the occurrence of an event that would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, operations, earnings, properties, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects, stockholders’ equity or results of operations. We have no obligation to sell the shares available for sale pursuant to the ATM Sales Agreement.
In connection with the Eversana Agreement, we entered into the Eversana Credit Facility, pursuant to which Eversana agreed to provide a revolving credit facility of up to $5 million to us upon FDA approval of the Gimoti NDA, as well as certain other customary conditions. The Eversana Credit Facility terminates on June 19, 2025, unless terminated earlier pursuant to its terms. The Eversana Credit Facility is secured by all of the Company’s personal property other than its intellectual property. Under the terms of the Eversana Credit Facility, we cannot grant an interest in our intellectual property to any other person. Each loan under the Eversana Credit Facility will bear interest at an annual rate equal to 10.0%, with such interest due at the end of the loan term. In June 2020 we borrowed $2 million and in December 2020 we borrowed $3 million from the Eversana Credit Facility.
In January 2021, we completed the sale of 5,750,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering led by Laidlaw & Company (UK) Ltd. The price to the public in this offering was $2.50 per share resulting in gross proceeds to us of approximately $14.4 million. After deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and offering expenses paid by us, the net proceeds to us raised from this offering were approximately $13.1 million.
Management concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm also included an explanatory paragraph in their report on our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern. This doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least twelve months from the date of the financial statements could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds through the issuance of new debt or equity securities or otherwise. Future reports on our financial statements may also include an explanatory paragraph with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern. We have incurred significant losses since our inception and have never been profitable, and it is possible we will never achieve profitability. We believe, based on our current operating plan, that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations into the first quarter of 2022, excluding any future Gimoti revenue. This period could be shortened if there are any significant increases in planned spending other than anticipated. Even with the Eversana Credit Facility, we will be required to raise additional funds in order to continue as a going concern. Because our business is entirely dependent on the success of Gimoti, if we are unable to secure additional financing or identify and execute on other development or strategic alternatives for Gimoti or our company, we will be required to curtail all of our activities and may be required to liquidate, dissolve or otherwise wind down our operations. Any of these events could result in a complete loss of your investment in our securities.
These estimates of cash runway could be shortened if there are any significant increases in planned spending on commercialization activities, including for marketing and manufacturing of Gimoti, and our general and administrative costs to support operations. There is no assurance that other financing will be available when needed to allow us to continue as a going concern. The perception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may cause others to choose not to deal with us due to concerns about our ability to meet our contractual obligations.
We expect to continue to incur expenses as we:
●
continue the commercial activities for Gimoti;
●
manufacture commercial batches of Gimoti;
●
conduct the post-marketing commitment PK trial of Gimoti and any additional development activities should we seek additional indications;
●
maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and
●
continue to fund the accounting, legal, insurance and other costs associated with being a public company.

Operating Activities. The primary use of our cash has been to fund our clinical research, prepare our NDA, manufacture Gimoti, and other general operations. The cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily related to ongoing communication with FDA related to the resubmitted NDA, pre-approval and commercialization activities and other ongoing costs of operating the business. The cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily related to ongoing communication with FDA related to the NDA and to manufacturing registration batches of Gimoti. We expect that cash used in operating activities will increase due to commercialization activities, including manufacturing of Gimoti.
Financing Activities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received $5 million from borrowings under the Eversana Credit Facility, net proceeds of approximately $3.6 million from the sale of 1,490,813 shares of common stock pursuant to the FBR Sales Agreement, approximately $216,000 from the exercise of stock options to purchase 199,111 shares of common stock, approximately $119,000 from the sale of 118,491 shares of common stock pursuant to our ESPP and approximately $104,000 from the PPP loan.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we received net proceeds of approximately $6.1 million from the sale of 7,004,381 shares of common stock pursuant to the FBR Sales Agreement. We did not sell any shares through our ESPP during 2019.
The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:
●
the costs of commercialization activities, including costs associated with commercial manufacturing;
●
the commercial success of Gimoti, including competition with well-established products approved earlier by FDA, including oral and intravenous forms of metoclopramide, the same active ingredient in the nasal spray for Gimoti;
●
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on us or on third parties on whom we rely;
●
our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of Gimoti to meet demand, including whether our contract manufacturers, suppliers, and/or consultants are able to meet appropriate timelines;
●
the progress and costs of the post-marketing commitment to conduct a PK trial of Gimoti to characterize dose proportionality of a lower dose strength of Gimoti and the costs of any additional clinical trials we may pursue to expand the indication of Gimoti;
●
our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, and the costs incurred to do so;
●
the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, co-promotion or other arrangements that we may establish; and
●
costs associated with any other product candidates that we may develop, in-license or acquire.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Through December 31, 2020, we have not entered into and did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial collaborations, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purpose.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
In December 2016, we entered into an operating lease for office space in Solana Beach, California. The lease commenced on January 1, 2017, was extended in September 2018, December 2019 and December 2020, and has an amended expiration date of January 31, 2022. We also pay pass through costs and utility costs, which are expensed as incurred.
As of December 31, 2020, future minimum lease payments for our facility lease are approximately $149,000.
In accordance with the technology acquisition with Mallinckrodt, we may be required to make milestone payments totaling up to $52 million. The first $5 million is required on June 19, 2021, the one-year anniversary of our receipt of approval from
FDA to market Gimoti. The remaining $47 million in milestone payments depend on Gimoti’s commercial success. We will be required to pay a low single digit royalty on net sales of Gimoti. Our obligation to pay such royalties will terminate upon the expiration of the last patent right covering Gimoti, which is expected to occur in 2030, subject to possible extension should any additional, later expiring, licensed patents be granted.
