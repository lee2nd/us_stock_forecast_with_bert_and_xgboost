ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto, each appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview.
We strive to remain a leader in meeting the financial service needs of the local community and to provide quality service to the individuals and businesses in the market areas that we have served since 1853. Historically, we have been a community-oriented provider of traditional banking products and services to business organizations and individuals, including products such as residential and commercial real estate loans, consumer loans and a variety of deposit products. We meet the needs of our local community through a community-based and service-oriented approach to banking.
We have adopted a growth-oriented strategy that continues to focus on increasing commercial lending and residential lending. Our strategy also calls for increasing deposit relationships, specifically core deposits, and broadening our product lines and services. We believe that this business strategy is best for our long-term success and viability, and complements our existing commitment to high quality customer service.
In connection with our overall growth strategy, we seek to:
● Grow the Company’s commercial loan portfolio and related commercial deposits by targeting businesses in our primary market area of Hampden County and Hampshire County in western Massachusetts and Hartford and Tolland Counties in northern Connecticut to increase the net interest margin and loan income;
● Supplement the commercial portfolio by growing the residential real estate portfolio to diversify the loan portfolio and deepen customer relationships;
● Focus on expanding our retail banking deposit franchise and increase the number of households served within our designated market area;
● Invest in people, systems and technology to grow revenue, improve efficiency and enhance the overall customer experience;
● Grow revenues, increase tangible book value, continue to pay competitive dividends to shareholders and utilize the Company’s stock repurchase plan to leverage our capital and enhance franchise value; and
● Consider growth through acquisitions. We may pursue expansion opportunities in existing or adjacent strategic locations with companies that add complementary products to our existing business and at terms that add value to our existing shareholders.
You should read the following financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020 in the context of this strategy.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, net income was $11.2 million, or $0.45 diluted earnings per share, compared to net income of $13.3 million, or $0.51 diluted earnings per share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 showed an increase in interest and dividend income and a decrease in interest expense, which were both offset by an increase in interest expense and an increase in the provision for loan losses. The provision for loan losses was $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The allowance for loan losses was $21.2 million, or 1.10% of total loans, at December 31, 2020 and $14.1 million, or 0.79%, at December 31, 2019. Excluding PPP loans, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.20% at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non-performing loans was 269.8%, compared to 142.7% at December 31, 2019. The twelve months ended 2020 was impacted by a higher provision for loan losses resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic mandated shutdowns and economic disruption that caused elevated unemployment levels and deterioration in household, business, economic and market conditions.
Net interest income increased $6.4 million, or 11.1%, to $64.4 million, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, compared to $58.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net interest income was due to an increase of $759,000, or 0.9%, in interest and dividend income and a decrease of $5.7 million, or 23.6%, in interest expense. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, interest and dividend income included $4.8 million in interest income and origination fees from PPP loans. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $976,000 in positive purchase accounting adjustments and $193,000 in interest income and late charges from the full payoff of a $3.5 million credit-marked substandard classified loan, compared to $16,000 in positive purchase accounting adjustments during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The Company recorded prepayment penalties of $409,000 and $496,000 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Excluding the items mentioned above, net interest income increased $544,000, or 0.9%, from the same period in 2019. The decrease in interest expense of $5.7 million, or 23.6%, was due to a $3.7 million, or 21.5%, decrease in interest expense on deposits and a decrease in interest expense on FHLB advances of $2.0 million, or 28.6%.
General.
Our consolidated results of operations depend primarily on net interest and dividend income. Net interest and dividend income is the difference between the interest income earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets consist primarily of commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, residential real estate loans and securities. Interest-bearing liabilities consist primarily of certificates of deposit and money market accounts, demand deposit accounts and savings account deposits and borrowings from the FHLB. The consolidated results of operations also depend on the provision for loan losses, non-interest income, and non-interest expense. Non-interest income includes service fees and charges, income on bank-owned life insurance, and gains (losses) on securities. Non-interest expense includes salaries and employee benefits, occupancy expenses, data processing, advertising expense, FDIC insurance assessment, professional fees and other general and administrative expenses.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC RESPONSE AND ACTIONS.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, we responded to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic while prioritizing the health and safety of our community. On March 23, 2020, the Governor of Massachusetts issued an emergency order requiring all businesses and organizations that do not provide COVID-19 “essential services” to close their physical workplaces and facilities to workers, customers and the public from March 24, 2020 until April 7, 2020, which was subsequently extended to May 18, 2020. As a consequence of the order, we closed our branches and started the transition to working remotely. Our drive-up windows and ATMs remained open while we continued to service our customers through scheduled appointments and online channels. On June 29, 2020, we re-opened our branch lobbies to customers under Massachusetts recommended social distancing, safety and sanitation guidelines, while still offering appointments and online channel transactions as a means of promoting social distancing where possible.
The Governor implemented a four-phase reopening plan for the Company’s market area. State and local governments closely monitored key public health data as the situation evolved. On July 8, 2020, Massachusetts entered the first step of Phase 3 of the re-opening plan; however, on August 7, 2020, Massachusetts’ Governor Baker, indefinitely postponed the second step of Phase 3 of the reopening plan. On September 29, 2020, Governor Baker announced that effective October 5, 2020, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts would transition to the second step of Phase 3 only in lower-risk communities. Lower-risk communities are defined as cities or towns that have not been a “red” community in any of the last three Department of Public Health weekly reports. Under the final phase of the reopening plan, the “new normal,” businesses will not be allowed to resume normal operations until an effective treatment or vaccine is discovered.
On November 27, 2020, as public health data demonstrated an increase in case numbers within our market area, we made the decision to once again close our branch lobbies and conduct business through scheduled appointments, online channels, drive-throughs and ATMs. On December 22, 2020, Governor Baker announced a series of new COVID-19 restrictions on businesses and gatherings. The restrictions began on December 26, 2020, and on January 21, 2021, Governor Baker extended restrictions through February 8, 2021. The capacity limits for most industries (including restaurants, theaters, personal services, casinos, officer buildings, places of worship, retail, libraries, fitness centers, etc.) were reduced to 25% and the number of people allowed to gather outside was limited to 25 and indoor gathering were limited to 10 people.
Our business is dependent upon the willingness and ability of our employees and customers to conduct banking and other financial transactions. The COVID-19 global public health crisis and the resulting “stay-at-home” orders resulted in widespread volatility, severe disruptions in the U.S. economy at large, and for small businesses in particular, deterioration in household, business, economic and market conditions.
Paycheck Protection Program.
As a Preferred Lender with the SBA, the Company was in a position to react quickly to the PPP component of the March 27, 2020 $2.2 trillion fiscal stimulus bill known as the CARES Act launched by the Treasury and the SBA. An eligible business was able to apply for a PPP loan up to the lesser of: (1) 2.5 times its average monthly “payroll costs,” or (2) $10.0 million. PPP loans have: (a) an interest rate of 1.0%, (b) a two-year loan term to maturity, subsequently extended to a five-year loan term maturity for loans granted on or after June 5, 2020 and (c) principal and interest payments deferred from six months to ten months from the date of disbursement. The SBA will guarantee 100% of the PPP loans made to eligible borrowers. The entire principal amount of the borrower’s PPP loan, including any accrued interest, is eligible to be reduced by the loan forgiveness amount under the PPP so long as employee and compensation levels of the business are maintained and 60% of the loan proceeds are used for payroll expenses, with the remaining 40% of the loan proceeds used for other qualifying expenses. As of December 31, 2020, the Company received funding approval from the SBA for 1,386 applications totaling $223.1 million, with $7.1 million of processing fees.
On October 8, 2020, the SBA and Treasury released a simplified PPP loan forgiveness application for loans with balances of $50,000 or less, and on December 27, 2020, the SBA announced that the simplified PPP loan forgiveness amount had been increased to $150,000. Since April 6, 2020, the Company has originated 1,113 PPP loans with balances of $150,000 or less totaling $43.4 million. The Company started processing PPP loan forgiveness requests in October 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the Company processed 273 loan forgiveness applications totaling $55.8 million. Total PPP loans decreased $55.8 million, or 25.0%, from $223.1 million at September 30, 2020 to $167.3 million at December 31, 2020.
As part of the $900 billion COVID-19 relief bill that was signed into law on December 27, 2020, the SBA and Treasury announced a new $284.5 billion PPP, and started accepting applications from the Company on January 19, 2021. The closing date for the new PPP is March 31, 2021. The Company looks forward to building on new small business relationships enabled by the new PPP with a keen focus on cross-selling opportunities and increasing profitability.
Loan Modifications/Troubled Debt Restructurings.
The banking regulatory agencies, through an Interagency Statement dated April 7, 2020, have encouraged financial institutions to work “prudently” with borrowers who request loan modifications or deferrals as a result of the economic impacts of COVID-19. Pursuant to Section 4013 of the CARES Act, loans less than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019 will be considered current for COVID-19 modifications. Financial institutions can then suspend the requirements under U.S. GAAP for loan modifications related to COVID-19 that would otherwise be categorized as a TDR, and suspend any determination of a loan modified as a result of COVID-19 as being a TDR, including the requirement to determine impairment for accounting under U.S. GAAP. The Company has adopted this policy election to address COVID-19 loan modification requests that have been received from the earlier of either January 1, 2022 or the 60th day after the end of the COVID-19 national emergency.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company granted deferred loan payments for impacted commercial, residential and consumer customers who experienced financial hardship due to COVID-19. The loan payment deferrals can be up to 90 days, depending upon the financial needs of each customer. Further deferrals will be re-evaluated on a customer-by-customer basis upon the expiration of the existing deferral period. As of June 30, 2020, the deferred loan payment modifications totaled $261.0 million (525 loans), for which principal and interest payments were deferred, and represented 15% of the total loan portfolio, excluding PPP loans. As of December 31, 2020, deferred loan payment modifications declined to $76.9 million (47 loans), or 4.4% of total loans, excluding PPP loans, in outstanding loans that continue to be modified under the CARES Act.
The table below breaks out the remaining modifications granted under the CARES Act at December 31, 2020:
The table below breaks out the status of the remaining modifications granted under the CARES Act as of December 31, 2020:
(1) Excludes PPP loans and deferred fees
(2) Residential includes home equity loans and lines of credit
The following table provides some insight into the composition of the Bank’s loan portfolio and remaining loan modifications, excluding PPP loans, as of December 31, 2020:
(1) Excludes PPP loans of $167.3 million as of December 31, 2020.
(2) Modified balances as of December 31, 2020 (Commercial real estate loans $64.0 million; Commercial and industrial loans $9.3 million; and Residential loans $3.6 million).
(3) Other consists of multiple industries.
Although the Bank’s loan portfolio contains impacted sectors and the commercial real estate and residential real estate sectors represent more than 100% of the Bank’s total risk-based capital, the concentration limits remain acceptable. The Company monitors lending exposure by industry classification to determine potential risk associated with industry concentrations, if any, that could lead to additional credit loss exposure. As stated above, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company identified sectors that have been materially impacted including, but not limited to: hospitality, transportation, retail, and restaurants and food service. These sectors potentially carry a higher level of credit risk, as many of these borrowers have incurred a significant negative impact to their businesses resulting from the governmental stay-at-home orders as well as travel limitations.
Allowance for Loan Losses.
The COVID-19 pandemic materially impacted the Company’s determination of the allowance for loan losses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. In determining the allowance for loan losses, the Company considers quantitative loss factors and a number of qualitative factors, such as underwriting policies, current economic conditions, delinquency statistics, the adequacy of the underlying collateral and the financial strength of the borrower. Beginning at the end of March 2020, a record number of Americans filed for unemployment benefits. The global pandemic could cause the Company to experience higher credit losses in its lending portfolio, reduced demand for our products and services and other negative impacts on our financial position, results of operations and prospects.
To appropriately reserve for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s loan portfolio, the Bank added a new qualitative factor category to the allowance calculation - “Economic Impact of COVID-19” at March 31, 2020. The allocation of additional reserves for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was based upon an analysis of the Company’s loan portfolio that included identifying borrowers sensitive to the shutdown (i.e. accommodation and food service, recreation, construction, manufacturing, and wholesale & retail trade) as well as a general allocation for the negative economic outlook as described above. The Company’s provision for loan losses was $7.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Of the total provision, $2.3 million was related to asset quality changes, $2.5 million was related to the inclusion of the acquired loan portfolio into the general reserves, and $2.3 million was related to the addition of the COVID-19 factor to the allowance. The total increase was based on management’s evaluation of certain qualitative factors included in the determination of the allowance, primarily a result of the abrupt slowdown in commercial economic activity resulting from actions announced by the State of Massachusetts to close all non-essential businesses in the state as well as the dramatic rise in the unemployment rate. Local unemployment rates continue to trail the national averages due to the slower reopening plan for Massachusetts relative to other states. Loans demonstrating cash flow declines and borrowers sensitive to the prolonged shutdown were identified and contributed to an overall increase in reserves for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.
In addition, on an ongoing basis, the Company has continually evaluated the loan portfolio acquired on October 24, 2016 from Chicopee. The acquired portfolio was initially recorded at fair value without a related allowance for loan losses. Subsequent to acquisition, there have been no indications that there has been any subsequent deterioration to the acquired portfolio. Due to the ongoing impacts and extended nature of the pandemic, during the three months ended September 30, 2020, the Company determined that it was prudent to provide an allowance for loan losses related to the acquired portfolio, which increased the provision by $2.5 million. The Company is continuing to monitor COVID-19’s impact on its business and its customers, however, the extent to which COVID-19 will impact its results and operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures.
Asset Quality.
Based upon an analysis of the portfolio to identify potentially impacted industries from the COVID-19 pandemic, including the downgrade of several lending relationships, specifically within the hotel portfolio, we allocated a total provision for loan losses of $7.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Of the total provision, $2.3 million was related to asset quality changes, $2.5 million was related to the inclusion of the acquired loan portfolio into the general reserves, and $2.3 million was related to COVID-19 factors. Our allowance as a percentage of total loans, excluding PPP loans, was 1.20% at December 31, 2020 and 0.79% at December 31, 2019.
As mentioned above, due to the ongoing pandemic, the Company evaluated the loan portfolio acquired on October 24, 2016 from Chicopee for COVID-19 sensitive industries. The acquired portfolio was initially recorded at fair value without a related allowance for loan losses. During the three months ended September 30, 2020, the Company provided an allowance for loan losses related to the acquired portfolio, which increased the provision by $2.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. In addition, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, special mention loans increased $66.2 million to $92.1 million at December 31, 2020, from $25.9 million at December 31, 2019. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we downgraded six relationships totaling $46.6 million in the hotel industry. The hotel industry has experienced disruption as a direct result of the negative economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Critical Accounting Policies.
Our accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. Given our current business strategy and asset/liability structure, the more critical policies are the allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses, accounting for non-performing loans and the ability to realize on our net deferred tax assets. In addition to the informational disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, our policy on each of these accounting policies is described in detail in the applicable sections of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Senior management has discussed the development and selection of these accounting policies and the related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
The process of evaluating the loan portfolio, classifying loans and determining the allowance and provision is described in detail in Part I under “Business - Lending Activities - Allowance for Loan Losses.” This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change. Our methodology for assessing the allocation of the allowance consists of two key components, which are a specific allowance for impaired loans and a general allowance for the remainder of the portfolio. Measurement of impairment can be based on present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent. The allocation of the allowance is also reviewed by management based upon our evaluation of then-existing economic and business conditions affecting our key lending areas and other conditions, such as new loan products, credit quality trends (including trends in non-performing loans expected to result from existing conditions), collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, specific industry conditions within portfolio segments that existed as of the balance sheet date and the impact that such conditions were believed to have had on the collectability of the loan portfolio. Although management believes it has established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels, if management’s assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect due to continued deterioration in economic, real estate and other conditions, and the allowance for loan losses is not adequate to absorb inherent losses, our earnings and capital could be significantly and adversely affected.
Our general policy regarding recognition of interest on loans is to discontinue the accrual of interest when principal or interest payments are delinquent 90 days or more, or earlier if collection of principal or interest is doubtful. Any unpaid amounts previously accrued on these loans are reversed from income. Subsequent cash receipts are applied to the outstanding principal balance or to interest income if, in the judgment of management, collection of the principal balance is not in question. Loans are returned to accrual status when they become current as to both principal and interest and when subsequent performance reduces the concern as to the collectability of principal and interest. Loan fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred, and the net fee or cost is recognized as an adjustment to interest income over the estimated average lives of the related loans.
We must make certain estimates in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates occur in the calculation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities, which arise from the temporary differences between the tax basis and financial statement basis of our assets and liabilities. The carrying value of our net deferred tax asset is based on our historic taxable income as well as our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets. Judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws or other factors which could result in a change in the assessment of the realization of the net deferred tax asset.
Analysis of Net Interest Income.
The Company’s earnings are largely dependent on its net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and the cost of funding (primarily deposits and borrowings). Net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets is referred to as net interest margin. The Company reports net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis throughout this entire annual report.
Average Balance Sheet.
The following table sets forth information relating to the Company for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The average yields and costs are derived by dividing interest income or interest expense by the average balance of interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown. Average balances are derived from average daily balances. The yields include fees which are considered adjustments to yields. Loan interest and yield data does not include any accrued interest from non-accruing loans.
(1) Loans, including non-accrual loans, are net of deferred loan origination costs, and unadvanced funds and allowance for loan losses.
(2) Securities income, loan income and net interest income are presented on a tax-equivalent basis using a tax rate of 21% for 2020 and 2019 and 2018. The tax-equivalent adjustment is deducted from tax-equivalent net interest and dividend income to agree to the amount reported in the consolidated statements of net income.
(3) Short-term investments include federal funds sold.
(4) Net interest rate spread, on a tax-equivalent basis, represents the difference between the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets and the weighted average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. See “Explanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measurements”.
(5) Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, represents tax-equivalent net interest and dividend income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. See “Explanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measurements”.
Rate/Volume Analysis.
The following table shows how changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected our interest and dividend income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to: (1) interest income changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); (2) interest income changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume); and (3) the net change.
The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate.
(1) Securities and loan income and net interest income are presented on a tax-equivalent basis using a tax rate of 21% for 2020, 2019 and 2018. The tax-equivalent adjustment is deducted from tax-equivalent net interest income to agree to the amount reported in the consolidated statements of net income.
Explanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measurements.
We believe that it is common practice in the banking industry to present interest income and related yield information on tax-exempt loans and securities on a tax-equivalent basis and that such information is useful to investors because it facilitates comparisons among financial institutions. However, the adjustment of interest income and yields on tax-exempt loans and securities to a tax-equivalent amount is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP is provided below.
(1) The tax equivalent adjustment is based upon a 21% tax rate for 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
At December 31, 2020, total assets of $2.4 billion increased $184.4 million, or 8.5%, from December 31, 2019. The balance sheet composition and changes since December 31, 2019 are discussed below.
Cash and Cash Equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents is comprised of cash on hand and amounts due from banks, interest-earning deposits in other financial institutions and federal funds sold. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $87.4 million, or 3.7% of total assets, at December 31, 2020 and $24.7 million, or 1.1% of total assets, at December 31, 2019. Balances in cash and cash equivalents will fluctuate due primarily to the timing of net deposit flows, borrowing and loan inflows and outflows, investment purchases and maturities, calls and sales proceeds, and the immediate liquidity needs of the Company. The increase in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020 is primarily due to an increase in deposits during 2020.
Investments.
At December 31, 2020, the investment portfolio of $213.8 million, or 9.0% of total assets, decreased $20.6 million, or 9.9%, compared to $234.4 million, or 10.7% of total assets, at December 31, 2019. Available-for-sale securities comprised the majority of the fair value of the portfolio and represented 94.4% and 97.1% of total investments at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The marketable equity securities portfolio totaled $12.0 million and $6.7 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, all securities were carried at fair market value.
The Bank is required to purchase FHLB stock at par value in association with advances from the FHLB. The stock is classified as a restricted investment and carried at cost which management believes approximates fair value. The Company’s investment in FHLB capital stock amounted to $4.7 million and $14.1 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company held $423,000 of Atlantic Community Bankers Bank stock. The stock is restricted and carried in other assets at cost. The stock is evaluated for impairment based on an estimate of the ultimate recovery to the par value.
Loans.
Total loans of $1.9 billion represented 81.5%, of total assets, at December 31, 2020, compared to 81.2% of total assets, at December 31, 2019. Total loans increased $151.3 million, or 8.5%, primarily due to an increase in commercial and industrial loans of $130.2 million, or 52.3%. Excluding PPP loans of $167.3 million, commercial and industrial loans decreased $37.1 million, or 14.9%, from December 31, 2019. As compared to December 31, 2019, commercial real estate loans increased $17.0 million, or 2.1%, and residential real estate loans, which include home equity loans, increased $8.4 million, or 1.2%. The decrease in commercial and industrial loans of $37.1 million, or 14.9%, was due to pay downs on existing revolving lines of credit of approximately $36.4 million, or 42.5%, from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. Commercial line utilization decreased from 33% at December 31, 2019 to 16.8% at December 31, 2020. In order to reduce interest rate risk, the Company currently services $38.1 million in residential loans sold to the secondary market.
Bank-Owned Life Insurance (“BOLI”).
The Company indirectly utilizes the earnings on BOLI to offset the cost of the Company’s benefit plans. The cash surrender value of BOLI was $72.9 million and $71.1 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Deposits.
At December 31, 2020, total deposits were $2.0 billion, an increase of $360.3 million, or 21.5%, from December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in core deposits of $422.6 million, or 41.2%. Core deposits, which the Company defines as all deposits except time deposits, increased from $1.0 billion, or 61.1% of total deposits, at December 31, 2019, to $1.4 billion, or 71.0% of total deposits, at December 31, 2020. Non-interest-bearing deposits increased $148.5 million, or 37.7%, to $541.8 million, interest-bearing checking accounts increased $24.8 million, or 35.3%, to $94.9 million, savings accounts increased $44.0 million, or 34.8%, to $170.3 million, and money market accounts increased $205.4 million, or 47.2%, to $640.8 million. The increase in core deposits of $422.6 million, or 41.2%, can be attributed to the government stimulus for individuals, lower consumer spending over the last several months, PPP loan proceeds deposited into borrower checking accounts, as well as the three new branches in 2020. Time deposits decreased $62.3 million, or 9.5%, from $652.6 million at December 31, 2019 to $590.3 million at December 31, 2020. Brokered deposits, which are included within time deposits, were $55.3 million at December 31, 2020 and $21.5 million at December 31, 2019.
Borrowed Funds.
At December 31, 2020, FHLB advances decreased $182.7 million, or 75.9%, from $240.5 million at December 31, 2019, to $57.9 million. The increase in low cost deposits provided the opportunity to repay approximately $132.7 million, or 55.2%, of high cost maturing FHLB advances. In addition, during the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company extinguished $50.0 million of FHLB advances that had a weighted average rate of 2.05%. The extinguishment of debt resulted in a prepayment penalty charge of $987,000 recognized in non-interest expense during the three months ended December 31, 2020. The earn-back on the expenses related to the extinguishment is less than 12 months. At December 31, 2020, the $57.9 million in outstanding FHLB advances carried a weighted average rate of 1.17%. Of the $57.9 million in outstanding FHLB advances, $42.3 million, or 73.3%, are scheduled to mature by December 31, 2021, and carry a weighted average rate of 1.45%. The remaining balance of $15.6 million has a remaining maturity of 2.1 years and a weighted average rate of 0.40%. The increase in low cost deposits provided funding for the PPP loan portfolio. The Company has access to the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Fund through March 31, 2021 to fund the PPP loan portfolio, if necessary.
Shareholder’s Equity.
At December 31, 2020, shareholders’ equity was $226.6 million, or 9.6% of total assets, compared to $232.0 million, or 10.6% of total assets, at December 31, 2019. The decrease in shareholders’ equity reflects $10.7 million for the repurchase of the Company’s common stock, the payment of regular cash dividends of $5.0 million and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $2.3 million, partially offset by net income of $11.2 million. Total shares outstanding as of December 31, 2020 were 25,276,193.
The Company’s book value per share was $8.97 at December 31, 2020, compared to $8.74 at December 31, 2019, while tangible book value per share increased $0.22, or 2.7%, from $8.14 at December 31, 2019 to $8.36 at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s and the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios continued to exceed the levels required to be considered “well-capitalized” under federal banking regulations.
Assets under Management.
Total assets under management includes loans serviced for others and investment assets under management. Loans serviced for others and investment assets under management are not carried as assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, and as such, total assets under management is not a financial measurement recognized under GAAP, however, management believes its disclosure provides information useful in understanding the trends in total assets under management.
The Company provides a wide range of investment advisory and wealth management services. Investment assets under management of $171.7 million, increased $21.9 million, or 14.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $149.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Comparison of Operating Results for Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
General.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company reported net income of $11.2 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to $13.3 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.
Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, net interest income increased $6.4 million, or 11.1%, to $64.4 million, compared to $58.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net interest income was due to an increase of $759,000, or 0.9%, in interest and dividend income and a decrease of $5.7 million, or 23.6%, in interest expense. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, interest and dividend income included $4.8 million in interest income and origination fees from PPP loans. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $976,000 in positive purchase accounting adjustments and $193,000 in interest income and late charges from the full payoff of a $3.5 million credit-marked substandard classified loan, compared to $16,000 in positive purchase accounting adjustments during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The Company recorded prepayment penalties of $409,000 and $496,000 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Excluding the items mentioned above, net interest income increased $544,000, or 0.9%, from the same period in 2019. The decrease in interest expense of $5.7 million, or 23.6%, was due to a $3.7 million, or 21.5%, decrease in interest expense on deposits and a decrease in interest expense on FHLB advances of $2.0 million, or 28.6%.
The net interest margin for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was 2.93%, compared to 2.90% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 2.95% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2.93% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Excluding $4.8 million in interest income and origination fees from PPP loans, the prepayment penalties and the purchase accounting adjustments discussed above, the net interest margin decreased from 2.88% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 to 2.83% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in the net interest margin was due to the continuing trend of market interest rates falling to historically low levels.
The average yield on interest-earning assets decreased 35 basis points from 4.14% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 to 3.79% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The yield on average loans decreased from 4.38% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 to 4.07% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the adjustments discussed above of $6.4 million and $513,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, the yield on average loans decreased from 4.34% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 to 4.04% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the average cost of total funds, including non-interest bearing demand accounts and FHLB advances, decreased 39 basis points from 1.28% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 to 0.89%. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the average cost of core deposits, including non-interest-bearing demand deposits, decreased 4 basis points to 0.27%, from 0.31% for same period in 2019. The average cost of time deposits decreased 52 basis points from 2.12% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 to 1.60% during the same period in 2020. The average cost of borrowings decreased 29 basis points from 2.88% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 to 2.59% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, average demand deposits, an interest-free source of funds, increased $123.4 million, or 33.7%, from $366.2 million, or 22.3% of total average deposits, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 to $489.6 million, or 26.0% of total average deposits, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, average interest-earning assets increased $200.9 million, or 10.1%, to $2.2 billion. The increase in average interest-earning assets was due to an increase in average loans of $200.7 million, or 11.7%, partially offset by a decrease in average securities of $31.1 million, or 12.7%. Excluding average PPP loans of $145.5 million, average interest-earning assets and average loans increased $55.4 million, or 2.8%, and $55.2 million, or 3.2%, respectively.
Provision for Loan Losses.
The provision for loan losses is reviewed by management based upon our evaluation of then-existing economic and business conditions affecting our key lending areas and other conditions, such as new loan products, credit quality trends (including trends in non-performing loans expected to result from existing conditions), collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, specific industry conditions within portfolio segments that existed as of the balance sheet date and the impact that such conditions were believed to have had on the collectability of the loan portfolio.
The Company increased the provision for loan losses by $5.1 million, or 190.7%, from $2.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, to $7.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. As previously mentioned, this increase was reflective of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s allowance for loan losses including the previously acquired Chicopee portfolio.
The Company recorded net charge-offs of $720,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, as compared to net charge-offs of $626,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded charge-offs of $963,000, compared to $1.7 million during the same period in 2019. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded recoveries of $243,000, compared to recoveries of $1.1 million during the same period in 2019.
The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.10% at December 31, 2020, compared to 0.79% at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non-performing loans was 269.8%, compared to 142.7% at December 31, 2019. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans, excluding PPP loans, was 1.20% at December 31, 2020.
Although management believes it has established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels, future adjustments may be necessary if economic, real estate and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment.
Non-Interest Income.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, non-interest income of $9.3 million decreased $454,000, or 4.7%, compared to $9.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in non-interest income was due to a $297,000, or 4.0%, decrease in service charges and fees, partially offset by an increase in other income from swap fees on commercial loans of $180,000, or 38.0%. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, service charges and fees included $110,000 in non-recurring interchange fee income as well as seasonal income in ATM surcharges of $180,000, which typically occurs each year in the third quarter. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the annual event did not occur this year. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, NSF fee income decreased $434,000, or 25.1%, from the same period in 2019. Transaction-based deposit account balances have increased significantly during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The lack of deposit withdrawals resulting from a decline in normal consumer spending habits due to the closure of nonessential businesses to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus has reduced transaction activity and the occurrence of overdrafts on deposit accounts.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company reported unrealized gains on marketable equity securities of $109,000 and a realized gain on the sale of securities of $2.0 million, compared to unrealized gains on marketable equity securities of $165,000 and a realized loss on the sale of securities of $97,000 during the same period in 2019. As mentioned previously, the Company also incurred a non-recurring $2.4 million loss on a terminated interest rate swap during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.
Non-Interest Expense.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, non-interest expense increased $3.9 million, or 8.2%, to $51.8 million compared to $47.8 million, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. As mentioned above, during the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company prepaid $50.0 million of FHLB borrowings. The transaction was accounted for as an early debt extinguishment resulting in a loss of $987,000. Excluding the loss, non-interest expense increased $3.0 million, or 6.2%, from the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.
The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits expenses of $1.7 million, or 6.1%. The increase in salary and employee benefits was due to several factors, including higher commissions and incentives associated with increased residential loan production of $720,000, compared to $350,000 from the same period in 2019. Also contributing to the increase was staffing for the three new branches opened in 2020, as well as annual staff salary increases. The funding of PPP loans and increase in loan volume resulted in an increase in deferred loan origination costs of $721,000, or 69.0%, against salary expense compared to the same period in 2019. FDIC insurance expense increased $602,000, or 140.0%. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the FDIC applied small bank credits against the quarterly assessments. The Company fully utilized its small bank assessment credits during the three months ended March 31, 2020. Occupancy expenses increased $346,000, or 8.3%, due to the opening of three branches in 2020, and an increase of $141,000, or 36.6%, due to COVID-19 cleaning related expenses. Data processing expenses increased $121,000, or 4.4%, other non-interest expense increased $620,000, or 8.5%, due to several factors but primarily due to swap fees paid to third parties of $165,000, and approximately $126,000 in PPP software costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in advertising expenses of $226,000, or 17.0%, a decrease in furniture and equipment of $136,000, or 8.1%, and a decrease in professional fees of $67,000, or 2.7%. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the efficiency ratio was 70.0%, compared to 70.7% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.
Income Taxes.
Income tax expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $2.9 million, or an effective tax rate of 20.8%, compared to $3.9 million, or an effective tax rate of 22.4%, for twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in the Company’s effective tax rate was primarily due to the effect of lower pre-tax income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources.
The term “liquidity” refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to fund loan originations, loan purchases, deposit withdrawals and operating expenses. Our primary sources of liquidity are deposits, scheduled amortization and prepayments of loan principal and mortgage-backed securities, maturities and calls of investment securities and funds provided by our operations. We also can borrow funds from the FHLB based on eligible collateral of loans and securities.
At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, outstanding borrowings from the FHLB were $57.9 million and $240.5 million, respectively. At December 31, 2020, we had $476.8 million in available borrowing capacity with the FHLB. We have the ability to increase our borrowing capacity with the FHLB by pledging investment securities or additional loans.
In addition, we have available lines of credit of $15.0 million and $50.0 million with other correspondent banks. Interest rates on these lines are determined and reset on a daily basis by each respective bank. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not have an outstanding balance under either of these lines of credit. In addition, we may enter into reverse repurchase agreements with approved broker-dealers. Reverse repurchase agreements are agreements that allow us to borrow money using our securities as collateral.
We also have outstanding at any time, a significant number of commitments to extend credit and provide financial guarantees to third parties. These arrangements are subject to strict credit control assessments. Guarantees specify limits to our obligations. Because many commitments and almost all guarantees expire without being funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts are not estimates of future cash flows. We are also obligated under agreements with the FHLB to repay borrowed funds and are obligated under leases for certain of our branches and equipment.
A summary of lease obligations, borrowings and credit commitments at December 31, 2020 follows:
Maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds. However, deposit flows, calls of securities and prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities are strongly influenced by interest rates, general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace. These factors reduce the predictability of the timing of these sources of funds.
The Company’s primary activities are the origination of commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans and residential real estate loans, as well as and the purchase of mortgage-backed and other investment securities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we originated $654.6 million in loans, compared to $372.7 million in 2019. We purchased securities totaling $159.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to purchases of $74.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $134.9 million in loan commitments and letters of credit to borrowers and approximately $325.5 million in available home equity and other unadvanced lines of credit.
Deposit in flows and out flows are affected by the level of interest rates, the products and interest rates offered by competitors and by other factors. At December 31, 2020, time deposit accounts scheduled to mature within one year totaled $503.2 million. Based on the Company’s deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of these time deposits will remain on deposit. We monitor our liquidity position frequently and anticipate that it will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments.
At December 31, 2020, the Company and the Bank exceeded each of the applicable regulatory capital requirements (See Note 12, Regulatory Capital, to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our regulatory requirements).
We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during the calendar year 2021, except in pursuance of the Company’s strategic initiatives. The Company does not have any balloon or other payments due on any long-term obligations or any off-balance sheet items other than the commitments and unused lines of credit noted above.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, other than noted above and in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to our consolidated financial statements, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
Management of Market Risk.
As a financial institution, our primary market risk is interest rate risk since substantially all transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars with no direct foreign exchange or changes in commodity price exposure. Fluctuations in interest rates will affect both our level of income and expense on a large portion of our assets and liabilities. Fluctuations in interest rates will also affect the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.
The Company’s interest rate management strategy is to limit fluctuations in net interest income as interest rates vary up or down and control variations in the market value of assets, liabilities and net worth as interest rates vary. We seek to coordinate asset and liability decisions so that, under changing interest rate scenarios, net interest income will remain within an acceptable range.
In order to achieve the Company’s objectives of managing interest rate risk, the Asset and Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) meets periodically to discuss and monitor the market interest rate environment relative to interest rates that are offered on our products. ALCO presents quarterly reports to the Board of Directors which includes the Company’s interest rate risk position and liquidity position.
The Company’s primary source of funds are deposits, consisting primarily of time deposits, money market accounts, savings accounts, demand accounts and interest-bearing checking accounts, which have shorter terms to maturity than the loan portfolio. Several strategies have been employed to manage the interest rate risk inherent in the asset/liability mix, including but not limited to:
● maintaining the diversity of our existing loan portfolio through residential real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans;
● emphasizing investments with an expected average duration of five years or less; and
● when appropriate, using interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate position of the balance sheet.
In 2020, cash flows from deposit inflows were used to pay down high cost FHLB borrowings and fund loan growth. The Company continues its emphasis on growing commercial loans which typically have variable interest rates and shorter maturities than residential loans.
The actual amount of time before loans are repaid can be significantly affected by changes in market interest rates. Prepayment rates will also vary due to a number of other factors, including the regional economy in the area where the loans were originated, seasonal factors, demographic variables and the assumability of the loans. However, the major factors affecting prepayment rates are prevailing interest rates, related financing opportunities and competition. We monitor interest rate sensitivity so that we can adjust our asset and liability mix in a timely manner and minimize the negative effects of changing rates.
The Company’s liquidity sources are vulnerable to various uncertainties beyond our control. Loan amortization and investment cash flows are a relatively stable source of funds, while loan and investment prepayments and calls, as well as deposit flows vary widely in reaction to market conditions, primarily prevailing interest rates. Asset sales are influenced by pledging activities, general market interest rates and unforeseen market conditions. Our financial condition is affected by our ability to borrow at attractive rates, retain deposits at market rates and other market conditions. We consider our sources of liquidity to be adequate to meet expected funding needs and also to be responsive to changing interest rate markets.
Interest Rate Risk.
Interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates. As interest rates change, the interest income and expense streams associated with our financial instruments also change, thereby impacting net interest income, the primary component of our earnings. ALCO utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes. While ALCO routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two-year horizon, they also utilize additional tools to monitor potential longer-term interest rate risk.
The simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as for derivative financial instruments. This sensitivity analysis is compared to ALCO policy limits, which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one and two-year horizon, assuming no balance sheet growth.
The repricing and/or new rates of assets and liabilities moved in tandem with market rates. However, in certain deposit products, the use of data from a historical analysis indicated that the rates on these products would move only a fraction of the rate change amount. Pertinent data from each loan account, deposit account and investment security was used to calculate future cash flows. The data included such items as maturity date, payment amount, next repricing date, repricing frequency, repricing index, repricing spread, caps and floors. Prepayment speed assumptions were based upon the difference between the account rate and the current market rate. We also evaluate changes in interest rate sensitivity under various scenarios including but not limited to nonparallel shifts in the yield curve, variances in prepayment speeds and variances to correlations of instrument rates to market indexes.
The table below shows our net interest income sensitivity analysis reflecting the following changes to net interest income for the first and second years of the simulation model. The analysis assumes no balance sheet growth, a parallel shift in interest rates, and all rate changes were “ramped” over the first 12-month period and then maintained at those levels over the remainder of the simulation horizon.
The preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast of net interest income, nor do the calculations represent any actions that management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates. They should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results. These hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including, among others, the nature and timing of interest rate levels, yield curve shape, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits and reinvestment/replacement of asset and liability cash flows. While assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions, we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions, including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change.
Periodically, if deemed appropriate, we may use interest rate swaps, floors and caps, which are common derivative financial instruments, to hedge our interest rate exposure to interest rate movements. The Board of Directors has approved hedging policy statements governing the use of these instruments. These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for our making fixed payments. We did not have any interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges at December 31, 2020.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements.
Refer to Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of the recent accounting pronouncements.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices.
The Company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of inflation.
