Item 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
This discussion is intended to compare the performance of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The review of the information presented should be read in conjunction with Part I, Item 1: “Business” and Part II, Item 6: “Selected Financial Data” and Item 8: “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management's Discussion and Analysis comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2019 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2018 can be found in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on March 12, 2020, which is hereby incorporated by reference.
The Company is a financial holding company registered under the BHCA. The Company currently conducts its business through its two direct wholly-owned subsidiaries: the Bank, and the Bank’s subsidiaries, ENL and ENHC; and ENFS and its subsidiary, TEA. The Company does not engage in any other substantial business. Unless the context otherwise requires, the term “Company” refers collectively to Evans Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
Impact of Covid-19
The Company's operations and financial results for the majority of 2020 were substantially influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company updated operating protocols to continuously provide virtually all banking services while prioritizing the health and safety of both its clients and associates. Banking centers offered drive through services without interruption, while lobbies were fully open or accessible to clients via appointment, conditional to virus trends at any point in time during the year. Sales associates, support teams and management have largely continued working remotely. In addition, the Company has maintained its focus on enhancing remote, mobile and online processes to better support a bank anytime anywhere environment. The most notable financial impact to our results of operations was a higher provision for loan losses primarily reflecting the substantial increase in economic uncertainty and the resultant potential for increased credit losses in future periods as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.
To assist clients during the pandemic, the Company implemented distinct COVID-19 relief programs to provide payment deferrals, fee waivers, and suspension of residential property foreclosures, among others. The Company also actively monitored the actions of federal and state governments to proactively assist clients and ensure awareness of each financial assistance program available.
The CARES Act established a loan program administered through the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), referred to as the paycheck protection program (“PPP”). PPP loans are 100% guaranteed by the SBA and are forgivable, in whole or in part, if the proceeds are used for payroll and other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements of the PPP. These loans carry a fixed rate of 1.00% and a term of two years (loans made before June 5, 2020) or five years (loans made on or after June 5, 2020), if not forgiven in whole. Payments are deferred until either the date on which the SBA remits the amount of forgiveness proceeds to the lender or the date that is 10 months after the last day of the covered period if the borrower does not apply for forgiveness within that 10 month period. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had originated 1,933 PPP loans totaling $203 million, included in commercial and industrial loans. PPP loans did not impact the Company’s allowance for loan loss as a result of the SBA guarantees. Fees collected from the SBA for these loans totaled $7.4 million. These fees are deferred and amortized into interest income over the contractual period of the loan. Upon SBA forgiveness or sale of a PPP loan, unamortized fees are then recognized into interest income. As of December 31, 2020, 34 PPP loans had received SBA forgiveness that totaled $16 million.
On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (“CAA”) was signed into law, which provides additional funding for the SBA's PPP for small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The CAA provides small businesses who received an initial PPP loan and experienced a 25% reduction in gross receipts to request a second PPP loan of up to $2.0 million. In January 2021, the SBA reopened the PPP program to small business and non-profit organizations that did not receive a loan through the initial PPP phase. The Company began accepting applications for the new round of PPP loans in January 2021.
During 2020, federal banking regulators issued guidance providing that modifications made to a borrower affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and governmental shutdown orders do no need to be identified as a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) if the loan was current at the time a modification plan was implemented. The CARES Act also addressed COVID-19 related modifications and specified that such modifications made on loans that were current as of December 31, 2019 are not TDRs. This TDR exemption, which was set to expire on December 31, 2020, was extended under the CAA, to the earlier of (i) 60 days after the national emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak terminates, and (ii) January 1, 2022. During 2020, the Company had applied this guidance and had modified approximately 381 of commercial loans with principal balances totaling $368 million, and approximately 298 modifications of consumer loans with principal balances totaling $37 million. Modifications may include payment deferrals (including maturity extensions), fee waivers and covenant waivers. At December 31, 2020 the Company had less than 10 loans with principal balances totaling approximately $2.8 million in COVID-19 modification related deferral periods.
The Company expects that the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to have a significant impact on our business. In particular, it is anticipated that a significant portion of the Company’s borrowers in the hotel industry will continue to endure significant economic distress, which has caused, and may continue to cause, them to draw on their existing lines of credit and adversely affect their ability to repay existing indebtedness, and may adversely impact the value of collateral. During 2020, the Company identified a well-defined weakness in the hotel industry as a result of the impact of the pandemic and classified the loans to clients within that industry as substandard. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s hotel loan portfolio was $81 million, or approximately 6.5%, of total commercial loans. As a result, total criticized assets increased to $140 million at December 31, 2020 compared with $51 million at the end of 2019.
Summary
Net income in 2020 was $11.2 million, a 34% decrease from 2019 net income of $17.0 million. The primary drivers of the decrease in the Company’s net income during 2020 were a $5.7 million increase in merger-related expenses associated with the acquisition of FSB and a $5.3 million increase in provision for loan loss primarily related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Net interest income was $59.8 million in 2020, a 15% increase from 2019, reflecting an increase in average loans in 2020 of 28% compared with 2019, while net interest margin was 3.37% and 3.82% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The FSB acquisition added $271 million of loans to the Company’s loan portfolio.
Provision for loan losses was $5.4 million and $0.1 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in provision for loan losses during 2020 compared with the prior year primarily reflects an increase in criticized loans and economic factors relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans increased from 1.17% at December 31, 2019 to 1.66% at December 31, 2020.
Non-interest income was $18.2 million and $18.1 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. During 2020 the Company recognized gains relating to the sale of investment securities and the sale of the previous administrative headquarters of $0.7 million each. The largest component of the Company’s non-interest income, insurance service and fees, was $10.6 million in 2020, relatively flat from 2019. Deposit service charges were $2.2 million in 2020, a decrease of $0.3 million from 2019. Non-interest income during 2020 includes a $0.6 million loss on an investment in a historic rehabilitation tax credit. There were no significant historic tax credit transactions during 2019.
Non-interest expense was $59.9 million, an increase of $12.0 million from 2019. Merger-related costs of $6.0 million and $0.2 million were incurred during 2020 and 2019, respectively, in connection with the acquisition of FSB. Salaries and benefits expense, the largest component of non-interest expenses, increased $3.4 million compared to 2019 due to the addition of FSB employees and merit increases. As a result of the FSB acquisition and COVID-19 impact, online banking activity, software costs, and volume related ATM card costs were up $1.1 million in 2020 when compared with 2019.
Strategy
The Company’s goal is to continue to increase market share and achieve scale while improving profitability and returning value to shareholders. The Company’s biggest strength and earnings driver is commercial and small business lending. The Company expects to continue to focus on building on this competitive advantage by adding personnel in this area.
Management has also bolstered its biggest driver of non-interest income, TEA, through both agency and talent acquisition as well as building out its employee benefits and financial services businesses. In addition, management intends to continue to develop strategies to deepen existing customer relationships with tailored product sets that reward the Company’s most loyal customers.
The Company’s strategies are designed to direct tactical investment decisions supporting its financial objectives. While the Company intends to focus its efforts on the pursuit of these strategies, there can be no assurance that the Company will successfully implement these strategies or that the strategies will produce the desired results. The Company’s most significant revenue source continues to be net interest income, defined as total interest income less interest expense. Net interest income accounted for 77% of total revenue in 2020. To produce net interest income and consistent earnings growth over the long-term, the Company must generate loan and deposit growth at acceptable margins within its market area. To generate and grow loans and deposits, the Company must focus on a number of areas including, but not limited to, sales practices, customer and employee satisfaction and retention, competition, evolving customer behavior, technology, product innovation, interest rates, credit performance of its customers and vendor relationships.
The Company also considers non-interest income important to its continued financial success. Fee income generation is partly related to the Company’s loan and deposit operations, such as deposit service charges, as well as to its financial products, such as commercial and personal insurance sold through TEA. Improved performance in non-interest income can help increase capital ratios because most of the non-interest income is generated without recording assets on the balance sheet. The Company has and will continue to face challenges in increasing its non-interest income as the regulatory environment changes.
The Company has focused its efforts on targeted groups in its community such as (1) smaller businesses with smaller credit needs but rich in deposits and other service needs; (2) middle market commercial businesses; (3) commercial real estate lending; (4) retail customers; and (5) municipal customers. The overarching goal is to cross-sell between our insurance, financial services and banking lines of business to deepen our relationships with all of our customers. These efforts contributed to the strong response by the Company to the many challenges related to the pandemic in 2020.
The Company strives to provide a personal touch to customer service and is committed to maintaining a local, community-based philosophy. The Bank has emphasized hiring local branch and lending personnel with strong ties to the specific local communities it serves.
The Bank serves its market through 20 banking offices in the Western and Finger Lakes regions of New York State. The Company’s principal source of funding is through deposits, which it reinvests in the community in the form of loans and investments. Deposits are insured up to the maximum permitted by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. The Bank is regulated by the OCC.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, as this information changes, the Consolidated Financial Statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments, and as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported.
The most significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in this financial review, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and how those values are determined.
Estimates, assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility. The fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third-party sources, when available. When third-party information is not available, valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques.
Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions and estimates underlying those amounts, management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses, business combinations and valuation of goodwill to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such, could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available.
Allowance for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of probable incurred losses in the Bank’s loan portfolio. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment on the part of management and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
Management’s methodology and policy in determining the allowance for loan losses can be found in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The activity in the allowance for loan losses is depicted in supporting tables in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Business Combinations
Mergers and acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with ASC 805 “Business Combinations” using the acquisition method of accounting. Assets and liabilities acquired and assumed are generally recorded at their fair values as of the date of the transaction. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.
Determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired often involves estimates based on internal estimate or third-party valuations using a discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation technique that may include the use of estimates. In addition, the determination of the useful lives over which intangible assets will be amortized is subjective in nature.
Changes to estimates and judgments used in business combinations could result in a significant difference in the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired which would impact total goodwill recorded. A change in the useful life of intangible assets could impact amortization amounts which could have an impact on our earnings.
Goodwill
The amount of goodwill reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements is required to be tested by management for impairment on at least an annual basis. The test for impairment of goodwill in an identified reporting unit is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires judgment on the part of management and the use of estimates related to the growth assumptions and market multiples used in the valuation model. The Company had $12.7 million in goodwill at December 31, 2020, including $10.9 million in the insurance agency activities segment and $1.8 million in the banking activities segment. The banking reporting unit goodwill resulted from acquisition of FSB. All of the insurance agency goodwill stems from the acquisition of various insurance agencies. There have been no purchases of diverse companies in which goodwill was subjectively allocated to different reporting units.
The valuation methodology used for the goodwill in the banking reporting unit is a five year discounted cash flow analysis. The Company used two valuation methodologies to calculate the fair value of the insurance agency reporting unit. The first methodology is a five year discounted cash flow analysis. The second was to measure fair value using an EBITDA (“Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization) multiple. This analysis indicated that no impairment existed as of the issue date. These valuation methodologies utilize key assumptions that include forecasts of revenues and expenses derived from Company projections for a period of five years, changes in working capital estimates, company specific discount rate derived from a rate build up approach, externally sourced bank peer group market multiples and externally sourced bank peer group change in control premium, all of which are highly subjective and require significant management judgment. Changes in these key assumptions could materially affect our estimate of the reporting unit fair value and could affect our conclusion regarding the existence of potential impairment.
Additionally, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the related deterioration in general economic conditions, the Company performed interim qualitative impairment tests during 2020. Likewise, the results of these interim qualitative tests did not indicate that the company's goodwill was impaired.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND DECEMBER 31, 2019
Net Income
Net income of $11.2 million in 2020 consisted of $10.0 million related to the Company’s banking activities and $1.2 million related to the Company’s insurance agency activities. The total net income of $11.2 million was a 34% decrease from $17.0 million in 2019. Earnings per diluted share for 2020 of $2.13 were 38% lower than the earnings per diluted share of $3.42 for 2019.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income, the difference between interest income and fee income on earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on deposits and borrowings, provides the primary basis for the Company’s results of operations.
Net interest income is dependent on the amounts and yields earned on interest earning assets as compared to the amounts of and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities.
‎
AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET INFORMATION
The following table presents the significant categories of the assets and liabilities of the Company, interest income and interest expense, and the corresponding yields earned and rates paid in 2020, 2019, and 2018. The assets and liabilities are presented as daily averages. The average loan balances include both performing and non-performing loans. Interest income on loans does not include interest on loans for which the Bank has ceased to accrue interest. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value. Interest and yield are not presented on a tax-equivalent basis.
‎
The following table segregates changes in interest earned and paid for the past two years into amounts attributable to changes in volume and changes in rates by major categories of assets and liabilities. The change in interest income and expense due to both volume and rate has been allocated in the table to volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each.
Net interest income increased by $7.7 million, or 15%, to $59.8 million in 2020 from $52.1 million in 2019. This increase primarily resulted from increased loan volume and lower savings and time deposit rates, partially offset by lower loan yields and an increase in savings balances. Overall, the increased volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities positively impacted net interest income by $13.7 million in 2020, while the rates earned and paid on those respective assets and liabilities had a negative impact of $6.0 million.
The total commercial loan portfolio average balance, including commercial real estate and C&I loans, increased $195 million, or 20%, from a $970 million average balance in 2019 to a $1.17 billion average balance in 2020. This increase was primarily the result of the origination of PPP loans, which averaged $137 million in 2020. Average consumer loans, including residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit, increased 63% from $232 million in 2019 to $375 million in 2020. The Company acquired approximately $271 million in total loans from FSB, largely consisting of residential real estate loans, during the second quarter of 2020.
On the funding side, total average deposits increased $371 million, or 29%, year over year to $1.6 billion in 2020. The increase from the prior year reflects the acquisition of $239 million of deposits from FSB during the second quarter of 2020, an accumulation of liquidity by commercial customers in response to the pandemic, including deposits related to PPP loans, and increases in consumer deposits from government stimulus payments and lower consumer spending.
‎
The Company’s net interest margin decreased from 3.82% in 2019 to 3.37% in 2020 while the net interest spread, or the difference between yield on interest-earning assets and rate on interest-bearing liabilities, decreased from 3.52% in 2019 to 3.19% in 2020. The yield on interest-earning assets decreased 87 basis points to 3.88% during 2020. The changes largely reflect the Federal Reserve’s decrease of the fed funds rate by 150 basis points during 2020, and changes in the mix of interest-earning assets, including increased interest earning cash balances, PPP loans and residential mortgages from FSB. PPP loans carry a fixed rate of 1.00%. Most of the Bank’s variable rate loan portfolio is tied to the Bank’s prime rate, which decreases correspondingly with decreases in the targeted overnight federal funds rate. Cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 54 basis points to 0.69% during 2020. The decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities is the result of lower rates as the Company continues to align rates on deposits. The rate paid on average time deposits decreased from 2.15% in 2019 to 1.32% in 2020. Average time deposits were 24% of total interest-bearing liabilities in 2020, compared with 28% in the prior year period.
The Bank regularly monitors its exposure to interest rate risk. Management believes that the proper management of interest-sensitive funds will help protect the Bank’s earnings against changes in interest rates. The Bank’s Asset/Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) meets monthly for the purpose of evaluating the Bank’s short-term and long-term liquidity position and the potential impact on capital and earnings of changes in interest rates. The Bank has adopted an asset/liability policy that specifies minimum limits for liquidity and capital ratios. This policy includes setting ranges for the negative impact acceptable on net interest income and on the fair value of equity as a result of a shift in interest rates. The asset/liability policy also includes guidelines for investment activities and funds management. At its monthly meetings, ALCO reviews the Bank’s status and formulates its strategies based on current economic conditions, interest rate forecasts, loan demand, deposit volatility and the Bank’s earnings objectives.
Provision for Loan Losses
The Company’s provision for loan losses of $5.4 million in 2020 increased significantly from $0.1 million in 2019 due to the impacts on the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic. A decrease in asset quality resulted from the elevated risk associated with the hotel portfolio, which increased the Company’s criticized loans. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company identified a well-defined weakness in the hotel industry and classified the loans to clients within that industry as criticized. At December 31, 2020, criticized assets totaled $140 million, with the hotel portfolio comprising 58% of that amount. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 1.66% at December 31, 2020 compared with 1.17% at the end of 2019. The Company records a specific reserve on impaired loans and a higher reserve percentage on criticized loan balances, or those loans risk-rated special mention or worse, which are collectively evaluated for impairment. At December 31, 2020, criticized loans that were collectively evaluated for impairment totaled $116 million, compared with $37 million at December 31, 2019. Overall, total loans collectively evaluated for impairment increased $463 million to $1.7 billion at the end of 2020 from $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of $211 million of FSB loans which were recorded at fair value at acquisition and have no allowance for loan loss allocation at December 31, 2020, and $183 million of SBA guaranteed PPP loans that also have no allowance for loan loss allocation at December 31, 2020. The significant increase in provision for loan losses during 2020 included changes in qualitative factors in response to economic trends and conditions impacted by the economic shutdown precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
A description of how the allowance for loan losses is determined along with tabular data depicting the key factors in calculating the allowance is set forth in Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
‎
Non-accrual, Past Due and Restructured Loans
The following table summarizes the Bank’s non-accrual and accruing loans 90 days or more past due as of the dates listed below. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information about the Company's non-accrual, past due and restructured loans.
Non-performing loans increased $13.7 million from $14.4 million at December 31, 2019 to $28.1 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in 2020 was primarily driven by loans previously in accruing status that moved to non-accrual status during 2020. During 2019 the Company benefited from the restructuring and payoff of one large commercial loan relationship of $8.6 million that was in nonaccrual status. Non-performing loans included $27.9 million of non-accruing loans at December 31, 2020 compared with $14.4 million at December 31, 2019. There were $0.2 million of accruing loans categorized as 90 days past due at December 31, 2020. There were no accruing loans categorized as 90 days past due at December 31, 2019.
The Company had $7.3 million in loans that were restructured and deemed to be TDRs at December 31, 2020 with $5.3 million of those balances in non-accrual status, compared with $8.3 million and $4.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019. Any TDR that is placed on non-accrual is not returned to accruing status until the borrower makes timely payments as contracted for at least six months and future collection under the revised terms is probable. All of the restructurings were completed in an effort to maximize the Company’s ability to collect on loans where borrowers were experiencing financial difficulty. Modifications made to loans in a troubled debt restructuring did not have a material impact on the Company’s net income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The reserve for a TDR is based upon the present value of the future expected cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective rate or upon the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell, if the loan is deemed collateral dependent. This reserve methodology is used because all TDR loans are considered impaired. In accordance with the CARES Act and federal banking regulators issued guidance, modifications made to a borrower affected by the COVID-19 pandemic do not result in a TDR classification if the loan was current were current as of December 31, 2019.
‎
The following table presents the Company’s TDR loans as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:
‎
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses
The following table summarizes the Bank’s allowance for loan and lease losses and changes in the allowance for loan losses by categories:
‎
During 2020, the Company had net loan charge-offs of $0.1 million, compared to net loan recoveries of $0.3 million in 2019. The ratio of net loan charge-offs to average net loans outstanding was 0.01% in 2020 compared with a net loan recoveries ratio of 0.03% in 2019. There were no significant charge-offs or recoveries in 2020. During 2019 a $0.7 million recovery was recognized when a previously charged-off commercial loan paid off.
An allocation of the allowance for loan losses by portfolio type over the past five years follows:
* includes construction loans
** includes other loans
Commercial mortgages comprised 65% of the allowance for loan losses, and correspondingly, the commercial mortgage portfolio made up the largest proportion, or 48%, of the total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020, as compared with 59% of the allowance and 61% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2019. The change in the commercial mortgage percentage of the allowance as it compares to the percentage of total loans primarily reflects the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s hotel loan portfolio.
C&I loans comprised 24% of the allowance for loan losses and 25% of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020, as compared with 30% of the allowance and 20% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2019. The change in the C&I loan percentage of the allowance as it compares to the percentage of total loans primarily reflects the originations of government guaranteed PPP loans during 2020.
Residential mortgages comprised 8% of the allowance for loan losses and 22% of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020, as compared with 7% of the allowance and 13% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2019. The change in the residential mortgage percentage of the allowance as it compares to the percentage of total loans primarily reflects the acquisition of FSB loans which were recorded at fair value with no related allowance for loan loss at inception. Subsequently, the acquired portfolio is evaluated for potential allowances.
Overall, the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans decreased from 1.24% at December 31, 2019 to 1.21% on December 31, 2020. The decrease reflects the impact of the additions FSB loans and PPP loans, as well as a sustained level of low charge-offs, partially offset by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020. The non-performing loans to total loans ratio increased from 1.17% at the end of 2019, to 1.66% at the conclusion of 2020.
The Company evaluates the loan portfolio to ensure that specific credits are appropriately graded and reserved. At least annually, borrowers’ financial information is reviewed by the individual relationship managers. Independent of the individual relationship managers, the loan review department monitors the management of the Company’s commercial loan
portfolio. The Company’s loan review function reviews at least 35% of the commercial loan portfolio annually. The Company believes that the allowance for loan losses is reflective of a fair assessment of the current environment and credit quality trends.
Non-Interest Income
Total non-interest income increased by $0.1 million from $18.1 million in 2019 to $18.2 million in 2020. The Company recorded a net loss of $0.6 million as a result of the recognition of a historic tax credit transaction in non-interest income during 2020. Additionally, deposit service charges were down $0.3 million to $2.2 million at December 31, 2020 due to certain fees that had been temporarily suspended during the second quarter of 2020 to assist customers affected by COVID-19. These decreases were offset by a $0.7 million gain on sale of investment securities and a $0.7 million gain on sale of the Company’s previous administrative headquarters in 2020. Insurance services fees of $10.6 million remained relatively flat compared to 2019. Insurance revenue remains the largest component of non-interest income at 58% of total non-interest income. TEA is a source of diversification in the earnings of the Company and helps generate income not directly impacted by difficult credit or interest rate environments.
The Company is actively engaged in the community by financing historic rehabilitation projects in Buffalo and enhances its yield by investing in related tax credits. When a project is completed, the Company recognizes tax benefits with a related reduction in the investment. The impact on non-interest income from historic tax credit investments was a $0.6 million loss in 2020. There were no significant historic tax credit transactions in 2019. The 2020 loss on historic tax credit investments was more than offset by corresponding income tax benefit.
Non-Interest Expense
Total non-interest expense increased $12.1 million, or 25%, from $47.8 million in 2019 to $59.9 million in 2020. The largest increases in non-interest expense in 2020 when compared with 2019 were merger-related expenses in connection with the acquisition of FSB of $5.7 million, salaries and employee benefits, which increased $3.4 million, or 11%, due to the addition of new employees from FSB and merit increases, technology and communication expenses, which increased $1.1 million, or 27%, FDIC insurance expense, which increased $0.7 million as a result of growth in assets and the reduction of prior year expenses due to the application of the FDIC’s small bank assessment credit in 2019, and occupancy expense, which increased $0.9 million also reflecting the addition of FSB.
Technology and communications expenses increased due to higher software costs, volume related ATM card costs and online banking activity, primarily as a result of the FSB acquisition and COVID-19 impact.
The efficiency ratio expresses the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. The Company's GAAP efficiency ratio, or non-interest operating expenses divided by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income, was 76.7% in 2020 compared with 68.2% in 2019. The Company’s non-GAAP efficiency ratio, which excludes amortization expense, gains and losses from investment securities, merger-related expenses and the impact of historic tax credit transactions, was 68.5% in 2020 compared with 67.2% in 2019.
Taxes
Income tax expense for the year was $1.6 million, representing an effective tax rate of 12.2% compared with an effective tax rate of 23.5% in 2019. Income tax expense in 2020 included a tax benefit relating to historic tax credit transactions. Excluding the impact of the historic tax credit transaction, the effective tax rate was 23.9% in 2020. For further discussion of the Company’s income taxes, including a reconciliation from the statutory rate to the actual rate for 2020 and 2019, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
‎
FINANCIAL CONDITION
The Company had total assets of $2.0 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $584 million, or 40%, from $1.5 billion at December 31, 2019. Net loans of $1.7 billion at the most recent year end were $462 million, or 38%, higher than at December 31, 2019. Total investment securities increased $36 million, or 28%, from $130 million at December 31, 2019 to $167 million at December 31, 2020, and deposits increased by $504 million, or 40%, to $1.8 billion as of the end of 2020. Stockholders’ equity was $169 million at the conclusion of 2020, a $20 million, or 14% increase from $148 million at the previous year end.
Securities Activities
The primary objectives of the Bank’s securities portfolio are to provide liquidity and maximize income while preserving safety of principal. Secondary objectives include: providing collateral to secure local municipal deposits, the investment of funds during periods of decreased loan demand, interest rate sensitivity considerations, supporting local communities through the purchase of tax-exempt securities and tax planning considerations. The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for establishing overall policy and reviewing performance of the Bank’s investments.
Under the Bank’s policy, acceptable portfolio investments include: United States Government obligations, obligations of federal agencies or U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises, mortgage-backed securities, municipal obligations (general obligations, revenue obligations, school districts and non-rated issues from the Bank’s general market area), banker’s acceptances, certificates of deposit, Industrial Development Authority Bonds, Public Housing Authority Bonds, corporate bonds (each corporation limited to the Bank’s legal lending limit), collateralized mortgage obligations, Small Business Investment Companies (SBIC), Federal Reserve stock and Federal Home Loan Bank stock.
In regard to municipal securities, the Company’s general investment policy is that in-state securities must be rated at least Moody’s Baa (or equivalent) at the time of purchase. The Company reviews the ratings report and municipality financial statements and prepares a pre-purchase analysis report before the purchase of any municipal securities. Out-of-state issues must be rated by Moody’s at least Aa (or equivalent) at the time of purchase. The Company did not own any out-of-state municipal bonds at December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019. Bonds rated below A are reviewed periodically to ensure their continued creditworthiness. While purchase of non-rated municipal securities is permitted, such purchases are limited to bonds issued by municipalities in the Company’s general market area. Those municipalities are typically customers of the Bank whose financial situation is familiar to management. The financial statements of the issuers of non-rated securities are reviewed by the Bank and a credit file of the issuers is kept on each non-rated municipal security with relevant financial information.
The Company has not experienced any credit troubles in its municipal bond portfolio and does not believe any credit troubles are imminent. Aside from the non-rated municipal securities to local municipalities discussed above that are considered held-to-maturity, all of the Company’s available-for-sale municipal bonds are investment-grade government obligation (“G.O.”) bonds. G.O. bonds are generally considered safer than revenue bonds because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the government while revenue bonds rely on the revenue produced by a particular project. All of the Company’s municipal bonds are to municipalities in New York State. To the Company’s knowledge, there has never been a default on a NY G.O. bond in the history of the state. The Company believes that its risk of loss on default of a G.O. municipal bond for the Company is relatively low. However, historical performance does not guarantee future performance.
All fixed and adjustable rate mortgage pools backing the Company’s mortgage-backed securities contain a certain amount of risk related to the uncertainty of prepayments of the underlying mortgages. Interest rate changes have a direct impact on prepayment rates. The Company uses a third-party developed model to monitor the average life and yield volatility of mortgage pools under various interest rate assumptions.
The Company designates all securities at the time of purchase as either “held to maturity” or “available for sale.” Securities designated as held to maturity are reported at amortized cost and consist of municipal investments that the Bank has made in its local market area. At December 31, 2020, $4.2 million in securities were designated as held to maturity. Debt and mortgage backed securities designated as available for sale are reported at fair market value.
Fair values for available for sale securities are determined using independent pricing services and market-participating brokers. The Company utilizes a third-party for these pricing services. The third-party utilizes evaluated pricing models that vary by asset class and incorporate available trade, bid and other market information for structured securities, cash flow and, when available, loan performance data. Because many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis, the third-party service provider’s evaluated pricing applications apply information as applicable through processes, such as benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing, to prepare evaluations. In addition, our third-party pricing service provider uses model processes, such as the Option Adjusted Spread model, to assess interest rate impact and develop prepayment scenarios. The models and the process take into account market convention. For each asset class, a team of evaluators gathers information from market sources and integrates relevant credit information, perceived market movements and sector news into the evaluated pricing applications and models. The third party, at times, may determine that it does not have sufficient verifiable information to value a particular security. In these cases the Company will utilize valuations from another pricing service.
Management believes that it has a sufficient understanding of the third party service’s valuation models, assumptions and inputs used in determining the fair value of securities to enable management to maintain an appropriate system of internal control. On a quarterly basis the Company reviews changes, as submitted by our third-party pricing service provider, in the market value of its securities portfolio. Individual changes in valuations are reviewed for consistency with general interest rate movements and any known credit concerns for specific securities. Additionally, on a quarterly basis the Company has its entire securities portfolio priced by a second pricing service to determine consistency with another market evaluator. If, on the Company’s review or in comparing with another servicer, a material difference between pricing evaluations were to exist, the Company may submit an inquiry to our third party pricing service provider regarding the data used to value a particular security. If the Company determines it has market information that would support a different valuation than our third-party pricing service provider’s evaluation it can submit a challenge for a change to that security’s valuation. There were no material differences in valuations noted in 2020 or 2019.
The available for sale portfolio totaled $162 million or approximately 97% of the Company’s securities portfolio at December 31, 2020. Net unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities resulted in an unrealized gain of $3.2 million at December 31, 2020, as compared with $0.7 million at December 31, 2019. The change in the net unrealized position of the portfolio in 2020 was due to the decrease in market interest rates during the year. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are reported, net of taxes, as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the impact of net unrealized gains, net of taxes, on stockholders’ equity was $1.9 million.
Certain securities available for sale were in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2020. Management assessed those securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2020 and determined the decline in fair value below amortized cost to be temporary. In making this determination, management considered the period of time the securities were in a loss position, the percentage decline in comparison to the securities’ amortized cost, the financial condition of the issuer (primarily government or government-sponsored enterprises) and the Company’s ability and intent to hold these securities until their fair value recovers to their amortized cost. Management believes the decline in fair value is primarily related to market interest rate fluctuations and not to the credit deterioration of the individual issuer.
Securities and interest-bearing deposits at banks made up 14% of the Company’s total average interest-earning assets in 2020 compared with 13% in 2019. The Company’s securities portfolio outstanding balances increased from $130 million at December 31, 2019 to $167 million at December 31, 2020 and the Company’s interest-bearing deposits at banks increased from $28 million to $84 million over the same time period. The interest-bearing deposits are liquid interest-bearing cash accounts at correspondent banks. The increase in interest-bearing deposits reflective of excess liquidity due to growth in funding from customer deposits. At December 31, 2020, the Company’s concentration in U.S. government-sponsored agency bonds was 41% of the total securities balance versus 22% at December 31, 2019. Government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities comprised 52% of the portfolio at December 31, 2020, compared with 74% of the portfolio at December 31, 2019, and tax-advantaged municipal bonds made up 7% of the portfolio at December 31, 2020 versus 4% of the portfolio at December 31, 2019. The increase in securities was a result of the FSB acquisition in which $21 million of securities from FSB was added to the portfolio.
Income from securities held in the Bank’s investment portfolio represented 6% of total interest income of the Company in 2020 and 2019 and 7% in 2018. Taxable securities yields declined to 2.35% in 2020 from 2.71% in 2019, and 2.67% in 2018, while tax-exempt yields were 2.36% in 2020, 2.57% in 2019 from 2.34% in 2018. Returns weakened in 2020 as market interest rates declined. The tax-exempt portfolio has significantly declined since 2017 as the decrease in the Company’s federal tax rate has reduced the effectiveness of municipal bonds.
As a member of both the Federal Reserve System and the FHLB, the Bank is required to hold stock in those entities. The Bank held $3.5 million and $1.6 million in FHLB stock as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $2.3 million and $2.0 million in FRB stock at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Available for sale securities with a total fair value of $135 million at December 31, 2020 were pledged as collateral to secure public deposits and for other purposes required or permitted by law.
The following table summarizes the Bank’s securities with those designated as debt and mortgage backed securities at fair value and securities designated as equity and held to maturity at amortized cost as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:
‎
The following table sets forth the contractual maturities and weighted average interest yields of the Bank’s securities portfolio (yields on tax-exempt obligations are not presented on a tax-equivalent basis) as of December 31, 2020. Expected maturities will differ from contracted maturities since issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations without penalties.
LENDING ACTIVITIES
The Bank has a loan policy which is approved by its Board of Directors on an annual basis. The loan policy governs the conditions under which loans may be made, addresses the lending authority of Bank officers, documentation requirements, appraisal policy, charge-off policies and desired portfolio mix. The Bank’s lending limit to any one borrower is subject to regulation by the OCC. The Bank continually monitors its loan portfolio to review compliance with new and existing regulations.
The Bank offers a variety of loan products to its customers, including residential and commercial real estate mortgage loans, commercial loans, and installment loans. The Bank primarily extends loans to customers located within the Company’s footprint. Interest income on loans represented 94% of the total interest income of the Company in 2020, 93% in 2019 and 92% in 2018. The Bank’s loan portfolio, net of the allowances for loan losses, totaled $1.7 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The net loan portfolio represented 86% and 87% of the Company’s average interest-earning assets during 2020 and 2019, respectively.
‎
The following table summarizes the major classifications of the Bank’s loans as of the dates indicated:
Real Estate Loans
Approximately 75% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 consisted of real estate loans or loans collateralized by mortgages on real estate, including residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other types of real estate loans. The Bank’s real estate loan portfolio was $1.27 billion at December 31, 2020, compared with $972 million at December 31, 2019. The real estate loan portfolio increased by 31% in 2020 over 2019, primarily as a result of the acquired FSB loan portfolio.
The Bank offers fixed rate residential mortgage loans with terms of 10 to 30 years with, typically, up to an 80% loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio. Fixed rate residential mortgage loans outstanding totaled $348 million at December 31, 2020 compared with $156 million at December 31, 2019, which was 21% and 13% of total loans outstanding, respectively. This balance did not include any construction residential mortgage loans, which are discussed below. Residential mortgage originations in 2020 were $107 million compared with $28 million in 2019. The increase was primarily the result of customers refinancing as they were able to benefit from lower interest rates.
In connection with the FSB acquisition, the Company acquired a loan servicing portfolio of $107 million in principal balances in which residential real estate loans were sold to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”) and the servicing rights are retained by the Company. No loans were sold to FHLMC by the Company during the years 2020 and 2019. At December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $95 million in unpaid principal balances of loans that it services for FHLMC. The Company did not service FHLMC loans at December 31, 2019.
The Bank has a contractual arrangement with FNMA, pursuant to which the Bank sells certain mortgage loans to FNMA and the Bank retains the servicing rights to those loans. The Bank determines with each origination of residential real estate loans which desired maturities, within the context of overall maturities in the loan portfolio, provide the appropriate mix to optimize the Bank’s ability to absorb the corresponding interest rate risk within the Company’s tolerance ranges. In 2020, the Bank sold $15 million in mortgages to FNMA under this arrangement, compared with $13 million in mortgages sold in 2019.
‎
At December 31, 2020, the Bank had retained the servicing rights on $77 million in mortgages sold to FNMA, compared with a $76 million servicing portfolio of loans sold to FNMA at December 31, 2019. The Company recorded a net servicing asset for such loans of $0.9 million at December 31, 2020 and $0.6 million at December 31, 2019.
The Bank offers adjustable rate residential mortgage loans with terms of up to 30 years. Rates on these mortgage loans remain fixed for a predetermined time and are adjusted annually thereafter. The Bank’s outstanding adjustable rate residential mortgage loans were $16 million at December 31, 2020 compared with $2 million at December 31, 2019. At each respective time period adjustable rate residential mortgage loans represented less than 1% of total loans outstanding. With rates on fixed rate mortgage products at still near historic lows, there has been little demand for variable-rate products which has resulted in minimal growth in variable rate mortgage loan balances.
Overall, residential real estate loans increased from $159 million at December 31, 2019 to $365 million at December 31, 2020.
The Bank also offers commercial mortgage loans with up to an 80% LTV ratio for up to 20 years on a variable and fixed rate basis. Many of these mortgage loans either mature or are subject to a rate call after three to five years. To the extent required, loans exceeding an 80% LTV are reported on an exception report to the Board of Directors. The Bank’s outstanding commercial mortgage loans were $706 million at December 31, 2020, which was 42% of total loans outstanding, and 9% higher than the $645 million balance at December 31, 2019. The balance at December 31, 2020 included $634 million in fixed rate and $72 million in variable rate commercial mortgage loans, which include interest rate calls.
The Bank also offers other types of loans collateralized by real estate, such as home equity loans. The Bank offers home equity loans at variable and fixed interest rates with terms of up to 15 years and up to an 85% combined LTV ratio. At December 31, 2020, the real estate loan portfolio included $83 million of home equity loans, which represented 5% of total loans outstanding, compared with $69 million and 6% at December 31, 2019, respectively. Excluding home equity loans acquired from FSB, home equity loans were $66 million. The total home equity portfolio included $74 million in variable rate loans and $9 million in fixed rate loans.
The Bank also offers both residential and commercial real estate construction loans at up to an 80% LTV ratio at fixed interest or adjustable interest rates and multiple maturities. At December 31, 2020, adjustable rate construction loans outstanding totaled $73 million, or 4% of total loans outstanding, and fixed rate real estate construction loans outstanding totaled $41 million, or 2% of total loans outstanding. At December 31, 2019, adjustable rate construction loans outstanding totaled $85 million, or 7% of total loans outstanding, and fixed rate real estate construction loans outstanding totaled $14 million, or 1% of total loans outstanding.
Commercial and Industrial Loans
The Bank offers C&I loans on a secured and unsecured basis, including lines of credit and term loans at fixed and variable interest rates and multiple maturities. The Bank’s C&I loan portfolio totaled $430 million at December 31, 2020, compared with $251 million at December 31, 2019, a 71% increase. The growth primarily is attributable to PPP lending which added almost 1,000 new commercial customers. At December 31, 2020 there was $187 million in PPP loans outstanding. Excluding PPP loans, loan growth was muted due to economic factors, including the contraction in economic activity resulting from the pandemic and the reduced demand resulting from the availability of PPP loans. C&I loans represented 25% of the Bank’s total loans at the end of 2020 and 20% at the end of 2019.
Collateral for C&I loans, where applicable, may consist of inventory, receivables, equipment and other business assets. At December 31, 2020, 28% of the Bank’s C&I loans were at variable rates which are tied to the prime rate or LIBOR.
Consumer Loans
The Bank’s consumer installment and other loan portfolio totaled $0.2 at December 31, 2020 compared with $2 million at December 31, 2019, representing less than 1% of the Bank’s total loans outstanding at those dates. Traditional installment loans are offered at fixed interest rates with various maturities of up to 60 months, on a secured and unsecured basis. This
segment of the portfolio is done on an accommodation basis for customers. The Company does not actively try to grow the portfolio in a significant way. Other loans consisted primarily of cash reserves, overdrafts, and loan clearing accounts.
Loan Maturities and Sensitivities of Loans to Changes in Interest Rates
The following table shows the maturities of commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate construction loans outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and the classification of those loans due after one year according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates.
SOURCES OF FUNDS
General
Customer deposits represent the primary source of the Bank’s funds for lending and other investment purposes. In addition to deposits, other sources of funds include loan repayments, loan sales on the secondary market, interest and dividend income from investments, matured investments, and borrowings from the FHLB and from correspondent banks.
Deposits
The Bank offers a variety of deposit products, including checking, savings, NOW accounts, certificates of deposit and jumbo certificates of deposit. Bank deposits are insured up to the limits provided by the FDIC. The following table details the Bank’s deposits as of the dates indicated:
The following schedule sets forth the maturities of the Bank’s time deposits as of December 31, 2020:
Total deposits at December 31, 2020 increased $504 million or 40% from the end of 2019. The increase from the prior year reflects $239 million of deposits acquired from FSB and an accumulation of liquidity by commercial customers in response to the pandemic, including deposits related to PPP loans, and increases in consumer deposits from government stimulus payments and lower consumer spending.
Excluding acquired deposits from FSB, total deposits increased $296 million, or 21% from prior year. Included in the increase were non-interest bearing demand deposits and NOW deposits of $212 million and total savings of $167 million, reflecting deposits related to PPP loans and lower consumer spending. Partially offsetting the increase, total time deposits decreased $82 million from prior year. Economic factors, such as lower interest rates played a role in the changes in deposit mix from prior year.
As of December 31, 2020, savings deposits increased $239 million, or 41%, over the previous year end. The growth in savings deposits was attributable to a $153 million increase in consumer savings, $56 million in commercial savings deposits, and $30 million in municipal savings deposits.
Time deposits were $279 million as of December 31, 2020, a $3 million or 1% increase from December 31, 2019. The Company took a less aggressive stance during 2020 in rates for time deposits as liquidity was higher due to commercial customers response to the pandemic. Consumer time deposits increased $13 million or 5% from previous year end. Brokered time deposits, included in other time deposits in the tables above, provide an additional funding source for loan growth. Brokered time deposits decreased $10 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
The following table shows daily average deposits and average rates paid on significant deposit categories by the Bank:
Federal Funds Purchased and Other Borrowed Funds
Another source of the Bank’s funds for lending and investing activities is borrowings from the FHLB. The Bank had no outstanding balance on its overnight line of credit with the FHLB as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company’s use of its overnight line of credit with FHLBNY varies depending on its ability to fund investment and loan growth with deposits along with the line usage’s impact on interest rate risk. At December 31, 2020, the Bank had $44 million in FHLB borrowings compared with $10 million at December 31, 2019. The FHLB borrowings as of December 31, 2020 have various maturity dates through 2024 and a weighted average rate of 2.47%. In connection with Small Business Administrative Paycheck Protection Program, the FRB deployed the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (“PPPLF”) to supply
liquidity to participating financial institutions through term financing backed by PPP loans. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $0.7 million in PPPLF funds.
Subordinated Debt
On October 1, 2004, Evans Capital Trust I, a statutory business trust wholly-owned by the Company (the “Trust”), issued $11.0 million in aggregate principal amount of floating rate preferred capital securities due November 23, 2034 (the “Capital Securities”) and $0.3 million of common securities (the “Common Securities”). The Capital Securities represent preferred undivided interests in the assets of the Trust. The Common Securities are wholly-owned by the Company and are the only class of the Trust’s securities possessing general voting powers.
On July 9, 2020, the Company entered into Subordinated Note Purchase Agreements with certain qualified institutional buyers and institutional accredited investors. The Company issued and sold $20 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.00% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due July 15, 2030.
Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase
The Bank enters into agreements with certain customers to sell securities owned by the Bank to those customers and repurchase the identical security within one day. No physical movement of the securities is involved. The customer is informed that the securities are held in safekeeping by the Bank on behalf of the customer. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled $4.1 million at December 31, 2020 compared with $2.4 million at December 31, 2019. Balances can vary day to day based on customer needs.
Pension
The Bank maintains a qualified defined benefit pension plan (the “Pension Plan”), which covered substantially all employees of the Bank at the time the Pension Plan was frozen on January 31, 2008. All benefits eligible participants accrued in the Pension Plan through the freeze date have been retained. Employees have not accrued additional benefits in the Pension Plan from that date. Employees will be eligible to receive these benefits at normal retirement age. Additionally, the Company has entered into individual retirement agreements with certain of its executive officers providing for unfunded supplemental pension benefits under the Company’s Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and Senior Executive Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (collectively, the “SERP plans”). Information about the Company’s Pension Plan and SERP plans, including contributions, pension expense and actuarial assumptions, including return on plan assets and the discount rate utilized to determine future pension obligations, can be found in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company decided to fully fund the Pension Plan in 2017. As a result, the primary objective of the investment philosophy for the management of the Pension Plan assets shifted from long term capital appreciation to capital preservation. The Company believes that because the Pension Plan is frozen, managing the assets of the Pension Plan with a lower risk investment strategy is the optimal course of action. At December 31, 2020, the projected benefit obligation of the Pension Plan exceeded the value of the plan assets by $0.3 million.
The Company tested the sensitivity of the pension expense to changes in three key assumptions: return on plan assets, the discount rate, and salary rate increases. A 0.25% decrease in the rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in a decrease in pension benefit of 52% or $12 thousand. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would have resulted in a decrease in pension benefit of 8% or $2 thousand. Since the Pension Plan has been frozen, pension expense is not sensitive to compensation scale increases or decreases. The SERP has no plan assets; therefore there is no rate of return on plan assets. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would have resulted in an increase in SERP expense of 2% or $15 thousand. A 0.25% increase in the rate of annual salary increases would have resulted in an increase in SERP expense of less than 1% or $1 thousand.
‎
Liquidity
The Company utilizes cash flows from its investment portfolio and federal funds sold balances to manage the liquidity requirements it experiences due to loan demand and deposit fluctuations. The Bank also has many borrowing options. As a member of the FHLB, the Bank is able to borrow funds at competitive rates. Given the current collateral available, advances of up to $302 million can be drawn on the FHLB via the Bank’s Overnight Line of Credit Agreement. The Bank also has the ability to purchase up to $18 million in federal funds from its correspondent banks. By placing sufficient collateral in safekeeping at the Federal Reserve Bank, the Bank could also borrow at the FRB’s discount window. The Company’s liquidity needs also can be met by more aggressively pursuing time deposits, accessing the brokered time deposit market, including the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”) network, or accessing PPPLF. Additionally, the Company has access to capital markets as a funding source.
The cash flows from the Company’s investment portfolio are laddered, so that securities mature at regular intervals, to provide funds from principal and interest payments at various times as liquidity needs may arise. Contractual maturities are also laddered, with consideration as to the volatility of market prices, so that securities are available for sale from time-to-time without the need to incur significant losses. At December 31, 2020, approximately 3% of the Company’s debt securities had maturity dates of one year or less, and approximately 8% had maturity dates of five years or less. In addition, the Company receives regular cash flows on its mortgage-backed securities.
The Company, on an ongoing basis, closely monitors the Company’s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies, and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs in the normal course of business. As part of that monitoring process, management calculates the 90-day liquidity each month by analyzing the cash needs of the Bank. Included in the calculation are liquid assets and potential liabilities. The Company stresses the potential liabilities calculation to ensure a strong liquidity position. Included in the calculation are assumptions of some significant deposit run-off as well as funds needed for loan closing and investment purchases. At December 31, 2020, in the stress test, the Bank had net short-term liquidity available of $410 million as compared with $209 million at December 31, 2019. Available assets of $252 million divided by public and purchased funds of $358 million resulted in a long-term liquidity ratio of 70% at December 31, 2020, compared with 59% at December 31, 2019.
The Company does not anticipate engaging in any activities, either currently or over the long-term, for which adequate funding would not be available and which would therefore result in significant pressure on liquidity. However, an economic recession could negatively impact the Company’s liquidity. The Bank relies heavily on FHLBNY as a source of funds, particularly with its overnight line of credit. In past economic recessions, some FHLB branches have suspended dividends, cut dividend payments, and not bought back excess FHLB stock that members hold in an effort to conserve capital. FHLBNY has stated that it expects to be able to continue to pay dividends, redeem excess capital stock, and provide competitively priced advances in the future. The 11 FHLB branches are jointly liable for the consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. To the extent that one FHLB branch cannot meet its obligations to pay its share of the system’s debt, other FHLB branches can be called upon to make the payment.
Systemic weakness in the FHLB could result in higher costs of FHLB borrowings and increased demand for alternative sources of liquidity that are more expensive, such as brokered time deposits, the discount window at the Federal Reserve, or lines of credit with correspondent banks.
Contractual Obligations
The Company is party to contractual financial obligations, including repayment of borrowings, operating lease payments, commitments to extend credit, and purchase agreements.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had commitments to extend credit of $359 million, compared with $332 million at December 31, 2019. For additional information regarding future financial commitments, this disclosure should be read in conjunction with Note 19 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Capital
Total Company stockholders’ equity was $169 million at December 31, 2020, an increase from $148 million at December 31, 2019. Equity as a percentage of assets was 8.3% at December 31, 2020, compared with 10.2% at December 31, 2019. Book value per share of common stock increased to $31.21 at December 31, 2020 from $30.12 at December 31, 2019. The increase in stockholders’ equity and book value per share was primarily the result of $11 million in net income, common stock consideration issued in connection with the FSB acquisition of $12 million, and a $2 million unrealized gain on available for sale investment securities, offset in part by $6 million in dividends paid to common stockholders in 2020.
The aggregate dividend payment of $1.16 per share in 2020 was $0.12, or 12% higher per share than dividends paid in 2019. The Company typically pays a semi-annual dividend in April and October of each year. Management and the Board of Directors of the Company believe that the dividend level is prudent to maintain available capital to support the continued growth of the Company, as well as to manage the Company’s and the Bank’s capital ratios, while providing a dividend yield (dividend per share divided by stock price) competitive with peers in the industry at an annualized rate of 2.75% at December 31, 2020.
Included in stockholders’ equity is accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) which includes the net after-tax impact of unrealized gains or losses on investment securities classified as available for sale. Net unrealized gains after tax were $2.4 million at December 31, 2020, compared with $0.5 million at December 31, 2019. Such unrealized gains and losses are generally due to changes in interest rates and represent the difference, net of applicable income tax effect, between the estimated fair value and amortized cost of investment securities classified as available-for-sale. The Company had no other-than-temporary impairment charges in its investment portfolio in 2020 or 2019.
The Company and the Bank have consistently maintained regulatory capital ratios above well capitalized standards. For further detail on capital and capital ratios, see Note 23 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Market Risk
Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and/or interest rates of the Bank’s financial instruments. The primary market risk the Company is exposed to is interest rate risk. The core banking activities of lending and deposit-taking expose the Bank to interest rate risk, which occurs when assets and liabilities re-price at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest income earned by the Bank is subject to the effects of changing interest rates. The Bank measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in the future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Management’s philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income. The balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities and expected maturities of investment securities, loans and deposits. Management supplements the modeling technique described above with the analysis of market values of the Bank’s financial instruments and changes to such market values given changes in interest rates.
ALCO, which includes members of the Bank’s senior management, monitors the Bank’s interest rate sensitivity with the aid of a model that considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, as well as the interrelationships between the magnitude and timing of the re-pricing of financial instruments, including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. When deemed prudent, the Bank’s management has taken actions and intends to do so in the future, to mitigate the Bank's exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or off-balance sheet financial instruments. Possible actions include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the purchase of other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes. In 2020 and 2019, the Bank did not use off-balance sheet financial instruments to manage interest rate risk.

SENSITIVITY OF NET INTEREST INCOME TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES
Many assumptions are utilized by the Bank to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income. The more significant assumptions relate to the rate of prepayments of mortgage-related assets, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit maturities. The Bank also assumes immediate changes in rates, including 100 and 200 basis point rate changes. In the event that a 100 or 200 basis point rate change cannot be achieved, the applicable rate changes are limited to lesser amounts, such that interest rates cannot be less than zero. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the Bank cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ significantly due to the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials (spreads) between maturity/re-pricing categories, as well as any actions, such as those previously described, which management may take to counter such changes. At each of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Bank's projected net interest income benefitted more from a 100 basis point increase in market rates compared with a 200 basis point increase in rates. This relationship was due in part to expected increases in deposit rates needed to retain deposit customers if rates moved up 200 basis points but were not required if rates only moved 100 basis points higher. In light of the uncertainties and assumptions associated with the process, the amounts presented in the table, and changes in such amounts, are not considered significant to the Bank’s projected net interest income
Financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk at December 31, 2020 included $328 million in undisbursed lines of credit at an average interest rate of 3.15%; $7 million in fixed rate loan origination commitments at 2.89%; and $1 million in adjustable rate letters of credit, which if drawn upon, would typically earn an interest rate equal to the prime lending rate plus 2%. Unused overdraft protection lines totaled $22 million.

The following table represents expected maturities of interest-bearing assets and liabilities and their corresponding average interest rates.
The amounts in the above table exclude acquisition fair value adjustments and debt issuance costs.
When rates rise or fall, the market value of the Company’s rate-sensitive assets and liabilities increases or decreases. As a part of the Company’s asset/liability policy, the Company has set limitations on the acceptable level of the negative impact of such rate fluctuations on the market value of the Company’s balance sheet. The Bank’s securities portfolio is priced monthly and adjustments are made on the balance sheet to reflect the market value of the available for sale portfolio. At December 31, 2020, the impact on equity, net of tax, as a result of marking available for sale securities to market was an unrealized gain of $2.4 million. On a monthly basis, the available for sale portfolio is shocked for immediate rate increases of 200 basis points. At December 31, 2020, the Company determined it would take an immediate increase in rates in excess of 200 basis points to eliminate the current capital cushion in excess of regulatory requirements. The Company’s and the Bank’s capital ratios are also reviewed by management on a quarterly basis.
Capital Expenditures
Significant planned expenditures for 2021 include the purchase of technology to improve workflow automation and operational efficiency. The Company believes it has a sufficient capital base to support these known and potential capital expenditures, currently expected to total approximately $1 million, with current assets.
‎
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
There will continually be economic events, such as changes in the economic policies of the FRB, which will have an impact on the profitability of the Company. Inflation may result in impaired asset growth, reduced earnings and substandard capital ratios. The net interest margin can be adversely impacted by the volatility of interest rates throughout the year. Since these factors are unknown, management attempts to structure the balance sheet and re-pricing frequency of assets and liabilities to avoid a significant concentration that could result in a negative impact on earnings.
Segment Information
The Company’s operating segments have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting. The Company’s operating segments consist of banking activities and insurance agency activities.
The banking activities segment includes all of the activities of the Bank in its function as a full-service commercial bank. Net income from banking activities was $10.1 million in 2020 compared with $16.0 million in 2019. The decrease in net income from banking activities was driven by a $5.3 million increase in provision for loan loss reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and higher non-interest expense in 2020 primarily as a result of the acquisition of FSB including merger-related expenses and salaries and employee benefit expenses. Non-interest expense increased $12.4 million to $51.3 million in 2020. The increase in non-interest expense was partially offset by an increase in net interest income. Net interest income, increased 15% from $52.2 million in 2019 to $59.8 million in 2020, resulting from growth of interest earning assets from loans acquired in the FSB acquisition and the origination off PPP loans. Total assets of the banking activities segment were $2.0 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $582 million or 40% from December 31, 2019. The year over year increase in total assets is primarily a result of PPP loans and the FSB acquisition.
The insurance activities segment includes activities of TEA, a property and casualty insurance agency with locations in the Western New York area. Net income from insurance activities was $1.2 million in 2020, an increase from $1.0 million in 2019. TEA’s total assets were $18.6 million at December 31, 2020 and $16.6 million at December 31, 2019.
