Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview
Reliance Global Group, Inc. (formerly known as Ethos Media Network, Inc.) was incorporated in Florida on August 2, 2013. In September 2018, Reliance Global Holdings, LLC, a related party, purchased a controlling interest in the Company. Ethos Media Network, Inc. was renamed Reliance Global Group, Inc. on October 18, 2018.
We operate as a diversified company engaging in business in the insurance market, as well as other related sectors. Our focus is to grow the Company by pursuing an aggressive acquisition strategy, initially and primarily focused upon wholesale and retail insurance agencies. The Company is controlled by the same management team as Reliance Global Holdings, LLC (“Reliance Holdings”), a New York based firm that is the owner and operator of numerous companies with core interests in real estate and insurance. Our relationship with Reliance Holdings provides us with significant benefits: (1) experience, knowhow, and industry relations; (2) a source of acquisition targets currently under Reliance Holdings’ control; and (3) financial and logistics assistance. We are led and advised by a management team that offers over 100 years of combined business expertise in real estate, insurance, and the financial service industry.
In the insurance sector, our management has extensive experience acquiring and managing insurance portfolios in several states, as well as developing specialized programs targeting niche markets. Our primary strategy is to identify specific risk to reward arbitrage opportunities and develop these on a national platform, thereby increasing revenues and returns, and then identify and acquire undervalued wholesale and retail insurance agencies with operations in growing or underserved segments, expand and optimize their operations, and achieve asset value appreciation while generating interim cash flows.
As part of our growth and acquisition strategy, we are currently in negotiations with several affiliated and non-affiliated parties and expect to complete a number of material insurance asset transactions throughout the course of 2020. We have acquired seven insurance agencies, including both affiliated and unaffiliated companies.
Long term, we seek to conduct all transactions and acquisitions through our direct operations.
Over the next 12 months, we plan to focus on the expansion and growth of our business through continued asset acquisitions in insurance markets and organic growth of our current insurance operations through geographic expansion and market share growth.
Further, the Company recently announced the beta launch of its 5MinuteInsure.com platform as the next step in expanding our national footprint. 5minuteInsure.com is a new and proprietary tool developed by Reliance Global to be utilized in conjunction with current and planned agency acquisitions, as well as affiliated agencies. The goal of the new offering is to tap into the growing number of online shoppers in order to drive traffic to the Company’s insurance agents and affiliates. 5minuteInsure.com utilizes artificial intelligence and data mining, to provide competitive insurance quotes within 5 minutes, with minimal data input. Live “hot leads” are then immediately transferred to the geographically closest agent and/or affiliates.
Insurance Operations
Our insurance operations focus on the acquisition and management of insurance agencies throughout the U.S. Our primary focus is to pinpoint undervalued wholesale and retail insurance agencies with operations in growing or underserved segments (including healthcare and Medicare, as well as personal and commercial insurance lines). We then focus on expanding their operations on a national platform and improving operational efficiencies in order to achieve asset value appreciation while generating interim cash flows. In the insurance sector, our management team has over 100 years of experiences acquiring and managing insurance portfolios in several states, as well as developing specialized programs targeting niche markets. We plan to accomplish these objectives by acquiring wholesale and retail insurance agencies it deems to represent a good buying opportunity (as opposed to insurance carriers) as insurance agencies bear no insurance risk. Once acquired, we will develop them on a national platform to increase revenues and profits through a synergetic structure. The Company is initially focused on segments that are underserved or growing, including healthcare and Medicare, as well as personal and commercial insurance lines.
Insurance Acquisitions and Strategic Activities
To date, we have acquired seven insurance brokerages (see table below), including both acquisitions of affiliated companies (i.e., owned by Reliance Holdings before the acquisition) and unaffiliated companies. As our acquisition strategy continues, our reach within the insurance arena can provide us with the ability to offer lower rates, which could boost our competitive position within the industry.

In 2020 the Company acquired one agency, UIS Agency LLC, and in 2019, the Company acquired three additional agencies to grow the company and improve profitability. Since these acquisitions are recent, management’s plans to achieve operational efficiencies and reduce expenses to enable the Company to continue to meet its obligations for at least the next twelve months. Additionally, Reliance Holdings has committed to fund the Company for at least the next 12 months in the event that the capital raise is not successful.
The spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in the United States has resulted in economic uncertainties which may negatively impact the Company’s business operations. While the disruption is expected to be temporary, there is uncertainty surrounding the duration and extent of the impact. Currently the Company has not seen any material financial impact as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. However, management is actively monitoring the global situation on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, industry and workforce.
Adverse events such as health-related concerns about working in our offices, the inability to travel and other matters affecting the general work environment could harm our business and our business strategy. While we do not anticipate any material impact to our business operations as a result of the coronavirus, in the event of a major disruption caused by the outbreak of pandemic diseases such as coronavirus, we may lose the services of our employees or experience system interruptions, which could lead to diminishment of our business operations. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and delay the implementation of our business strategy and we cannot anticipate all the ways in which the current global health crisis and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.
To this effect on April 4, 2020, the Company entered into a loan agreement with First Financial Bank for a loan of $673,700 pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) under the CARES Act. The Company intends to use the entire loan amount for designated qualifying expenses and to apply for forgiveness in accordance with the terms of the PPP. This loan is evidenced by a promissory note dated April 4, 2020 and matures two years from the disbursement date. This loan bears interest at a rate of 1.00% per annum, with the first six months of interest deferred. Principal and interest are payable monthly commencing one year after the disbursement date and may be prepaid by the Company at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. This loan contains customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults or breaches of the terms of the loan. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lender may require immediate repayment of all amounts outstanding under the note. The principal and interest of the loan are repayable in 18 monthly equal installments of $37,913 each. Interest accrued in the first six months is included in the monthly installments. Installments must be paid on the 24th day of each month. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has repaid a total of $165,000 on this loan. As of December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any loans payable in relation to the PPP loan. On November 17, 2020 the Company received notification from the SBA that the PPP loan has been forgiven in its entirety.
Off-balance sheet arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as such term is defined in Regulation S-K.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.
Business acquisitions: Accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired, which involves a number of judgments, assumptions, and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized in subsequent periods. Accounting for acquisitions can also involve significant judgment to determine when control of the acquired entity is transferred. We typically obtain independent third-party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values, including assistance in determining future cash flows, discount rates, and comparable market values. Items involving significant assumptions, estimates, and judgments include the following:
● Debt, including discount rate and timing of payments;
● Deferred tax assets, including projections of future taxable income and tax rates;
● Fair value of consideration paid or transferred;
● Intangible assets, including valuation methodology, estimations of future revenue and costs, and discount rates;
Contingencies: We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Significant judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of a loss, if any, from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In accounting for the resolution of contingencies, significant judgment may be necessary to estimate amounts pertaining to periods prior to the resolution that are charged to operations in the period of resolution and amounts related to future periods.
Goodwill and intangible assets: We test goodwill for impairment in our fourth quarter each year, or more frequently if indicators of an impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit with goodwill is less than its carrying value. For reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value, goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform the goodwill impairment test. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the fair value of the reporting unit. For reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value, goodwill is tested for impairment by determining the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we would record an impairment loss up to the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value.
Determining when to test for impairment, the reporting units, the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, and the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, and expenses and are developed as part of our long-range planning process. The same estimates are used in business planning, forecasting, and capital budgeting. We test the reasonableness of the output of our long-range planning process by calculating an implied value per share and comparing that to current stock prices, analysts’ consensus pricing, and management’s expectations. These estimates and assumptions are used to calculate projected future cash flows for the reporting unit, which are discounted using a risk-adjusted rate to estimate a fair value. The discount rate requires determination of appropriate market comparables. We base fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.
We test other identified intangible assets with definite useful lives when events and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable by comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. We test intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value method such as discounted cash flows. Estimating fair values involves significant assumptions, including future sales prices, sales volumes, costs, and discount rates.
Income taxes: We are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world. These estimates involve significant judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex. Resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of the applicable year. We are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income. In recent periods, our results of operations have benefited from increases in the amount of deferred taxes we expect to realize, primarily from the levels of capital spending and increases in the amount of taxable income we expect to realize in Japan and the United States. Our income tax provision or benefit is dependent, in part, on our ability to forecast future taxable income in these and other jurisdictions. Such forecasts are inherently difficult and involve significant judgments including, among others, projecting future average selling prices and sales volumes, manufacturing and overhead costs, levels of capital spending, and other factors that significantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized.
Revenue recognition:
All commission revenue is recorded net of any deductions for estimated commission adjustments due to lapses, policy cancellations, and revisions in coverage.
The Company earns additional revenue including contingent commissions, profit-sharing, override and bonuses based on meeting certain revenue or profit targets established periodically by the carriers (collectively the Contingent Commissions). The Contingent Commissions are earned when the Company achieves the targets established by the insurance carries. The insurance carriers notify the company when it has achieved the target. The Company only recognizes revenue to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the revenue will not occur.
Stock-based compensation: Stock-based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense using the straight-line amortization method over the requisite service period. For performance-based stock awards, the expense recognized is dependent on our assessment of the likelihood of the performance measure being achieved. We utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires significant judgment.
Determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires significant judgment, including estimating stock price volatility and expected option life. We develop these estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time. A small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation. We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model to value employee stock options and awards granted under our employee stock purchase plan. We estimate stock price volatility based on our historical volatility implied volatility derived from traded options on our stock.
