Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
General
On January 15, 2003, the Company became the holding company for the Bank, following the completion of the conversion of the Bank to a New Jersey-chartered capital stock savings bank. The Company issued an aggregate of 59,618,300 shares of its common stock in a subscription offering to eligible depositors. Concurrent with the conversion, the Company contributed an additional 1,920,000 shares of its common stock and $4.8 million in cash to The Provident Bank Foundation, a charitable foundation established by the Bank.
The Company conducts business through its subsidiary, the Bank, a community- and customer-oriented bank currently operating full-service branches and loan production offices throughout northern and central New Jersey, as well as Bucks, Lehigh and Northampton counties in Pennsylvania.
Strategy
Established in 1839, the Bank is the oldest New Jersey-chartered bank in the state. The Bank offers a full range of commercial and retail loan and deposit products, and emphasizes personal service and convenience.
The Bank’s strategy is to grow profitably through a commitment to credit quality and expanding market share by acquiring, retaining and expanding customer relationships, while carefully managing interest rate risk.
The Bank continues to maintain a diversified loan portfolio with an emphasis on commercial mortgage, multi-family, construction and commercial loans in its efforts to reduce interest rate risk. These types of loans generally have adjustable rates that initially are higher than residential mortgage loans and generally have a higher rate of credit risk. The Bank’s lending policy focuses on quality underwriting standards and close monitoring of the loan portfolio. At December 31, 2020, these commercial loan types accounted for 81.8% of the loan portfolio and retail loans accounted for 18.2%. The Company intends to continue to focus on commercial mortgage, multi-family, construction and commercial lending relationships.
The Company’s relationship banking strategy focuses on increasing core accounts and expanding relationships through its branch network, mobile banking, online banking and other digital services. The Company continues to evaluate opportunities to increase market share by expanding within existing and contiguous markets. Core deposits, consisting of savings and demand deposit accounts, are generally a stable, relatively inexpensive source of funds. At December 31, 2020, core deposits were 88.9% of total deposits.
The Company’s results of operations are primarily dependent upon net interest income, the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in interest rates could have an adverse effect on net interest income to the extent the Company’s interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature at different times or relative interest rates. The Company believes based upon its current balance sheet mix that assets may reprice more quickly than liabilities. Therefore, due to the current historically low interest environment, and with deposit rates at or near zero, a decrease in interest rates may result in a decrease in the Company’s average interest rate spread and net income, which could have a negative effect on profitability. The Company generates non-interest income such as income from retail and business account fees, loan servicing fees, loan origination fees, loan level swap fees, appreciation in the cash surrender value of Bank-owned life insurance, income from loan or securities sales, fees from wealth management services, investment product sales, insurance brokerage fees and other fees. The Company’s operating expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits expense, occupancy and equipment expense, data processing expense, the amortization of intangible assets, marketing and advertising expense and other general and administrative expenses. The Company’s results of operations are also affected by general economic conditions, changes in market interest rates, changes in asset quality, changes in asset values, actions of regulatory agencies and government policies.
Acquisitions
SB One Bancorp
On July 31, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of SB One Bancorp ("SB One"), which added $2.20 billion to total assets, $1.77 billion to total loans, which included PCD loans totaling $294.2 million, and $1.76 billion to total deposits, and added 18 full-service banking offices in New Jersey and New York. As part of the acquisition, the addition of SB One Insurance Agency, Inc. allows the Company to expand its products offerings to its customers to include an array of commercial and personal insurance products.
Under the merger agreement, each share of SB One common stock was exchanged for 1.357 shares of the Company's common stock. The Company issued 12.8 million shares of common stock from treasury stock, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares in the acquisition of SB One. The total consideration paid in the acquisition of SB One was $180.8 million. In connection with the acquisition, SB One Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of SB One, was merged with and into Provident Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method of accounting, the respective assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair value. The excess of consideration paid over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired totaled $22.4 million and was recorded as goodwill.
Acquisition of Tirschwell & Loewy, Inc.
On April 1, 2019, Beacon Trust Company ("Beacon") completed its acquisition of certain assets of Tirschwell & Loewy, Inc. ("T&L"), a New York City-based independent registered investment adviser. Beacon is a wholly owned subsidiary of Provident Bank. This acquisition expanded the Company’s wealth management business by $822.4 million of assets under management at the time of acquisition.
The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The Company recorded goodwill of $8.2 million, a customer relationship intangible of $12.6 million and $800,000 of other identifiable intangibles related to the acquisition. In addition, the Company recorded a contingent consideration liability at its fair value of $6.6 million. The contingent consideration arrangement requires the Company to pay additional cash consideration to T&L's former stakeholders over a three-year period after the closing date of the acquisition if certain financial and business retention targets are met. The acquisition agreement limits the total additional payment to a maximum of $11.0 million, to be determined based on actual future results. Total cost of the acquisition was $21.6 million, which included cash consideration of $15.0 million and contingent consideration with a fair value of $6.6 million. Tangible assets acquired in the transaction were nominal. No liabilities were assumed in the acquisition. The goodwill recorded in the transaction is deductible for tax purposes.
In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recognized a $2.8 million increase in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability. While performance of the acquired business has been adversely impacted at December 31, 2020 due to worsening economic conditions and declining asset valuations attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, asset valuations improved in the fourth quarter of 2020 and management has not identified a reduction in assets under management due to a declining customer base. As a result, the $9.4 million fair value of the contingent liability was unchanged at December 31, 2020, from December 31, 2019, with maximum potential future payments totaling $11.0 million.
Critical Accounting Policies
The Company considers certain accounting policies to be critically important to the fair presentation of its financial condition and results of operations. These policies require management to make complex judgments on matters which by their nature have elements of uncertainty. The sensitivity of the Company’s consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies, and the assumptions and estimates applied, could have a significant impact on its financial condition and results of operations. These assumptions, estimates and judgments made by management can be influenced by a number of factors, including the general economic environment. The Company has identified the following as critical accounting policies:
•Adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on loans
•Valuation of deferred tax assets
On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, "Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) methodology. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures, including loan commitments and lines of credit. The adoption of the new standard resulted in the Company recording a $7.9 million increase to the allowance for credit losses and a $3.2 million liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures. The adoption of the standard did not result in a change to the Company's results of operations upon adoption as it was recorded as an $8.3 million cumulative effect
adjustment, net of income taxes, to retained earnings.
The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that reflects management’s evaluation of the current expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. The Company maintains the allowance for credit losses through provisions for credit losses that are charged to income. Charge-offs against the allowance for credit losses are taken on loans where management determines that the collection of loan principal and interest is unlikely. Recoveries made on loans that have been charged-off are credited to the allowance for credit losses.
The calculation of the allowance for credit losses is a critical accounting policy of the Company. Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, related to past events, current conditions, and a reasonable and supportable forecast. Historical credit loss experience for both the Company and peers provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, where observed credit losses are converted to probability of default rate (“PDR”) curves through the use of segment-specific loss given default (“LGD”) risk factors that convert default rates to loss severity based on industry-level, observed relationships between the two variables for each segment, primarily due to the nature of the underlying collateral. These risk factors were assessed for reasonableness against the Company’s own loss experience and adjusted in certain cases when the relationship between the Company’s historical default and loss severity deviate from that of the wider industry. The historical PDR curves, together with corresponding economic conditions, establish a quantitative relationship between economic conditions and loan performance through an economic cycle.
Using the historical relationship between economic conditions and loan performance, management’s expectation of future loan performance is incorporated using an externally developed economic forecast. This forecast is applied over a period that management has determined to be reasonable and supportable. Beyond the period over which management can develop or source a reasonable and supportable forecast, the model will revert to long-term average economic conditions using a straight-line, time-based methodology. The Company's current forecast period is six quarters, with a four quarter reversion period to historical average macroeconomic factors. The Company's economic forecast is approved by the Company's Asset-Liability Committee.
The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective (pool) basis, with both a quantitative and qualitative analysis that is applied on a quarterly basis, when similar risk characteristics exist. The respective quantitative allowance for each segment is measured using an econometric, discounted PD/LGD modeling methodology in which distinct, segment-specific multi-variate regression models are applied to an external economic forecast. Under the discounted cash flows methodology, expected credit losses are estimated over the effective life of the loans by measuring the difference between the net present value of modeled cash flows and amortized cost basis. Contractual cash flows over the contractual life of the loans are the basis for modeled cash flows, adjusted for modeled defaults and expected prepayments and discounted at the loan-level effective interest rate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless either of the following applies: management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) will be executed with an individual borrower or the extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company.
After quantitative considerations, management applies additional qualitative adjustments so that the allowance for credit loss is reflective of the estimate of lifetime losses that exist in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. Qualitative considerations include limitations inherent in the quantitative model; portfolio concentrations that may affect loss experience across one or more components of the portfolio; changes in industry conditions; changes in the Company’s loan review process; changes in the Company's loan policies and procedures, economic forecast uncertainty and model imprecision.
Portfolio segment is defined as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine its allowance for credit losses. Management developed segments for estimating loss based on type of borrower and collateral which is generally based upon federal call report segmentation and have been combined or sub-segmented as needed to ensure loans of similar risk profiles are appropriately pooled. As of December 31, 2020, the portfolio and class segments for the Company’s loan portfolio were:
•Mortgage Loans - Residential, Commercial Real Estate, Multi-Family and Construction
•Commercial Loans - Commercial Owner Occupied and Commercial Non-Owner Occupied
•Consumer Loans - First Lien Home Equity and Other Consumer
The allowance for credit losses on loans individually evaluated for impairment is based upon loans that have been identified through the Company’s normal loan monitoring process. This process includes the review of delinquent and problem loans at the Company’s Delinquency, Credit, Credit Risk Management and Allowance Committees; or which may be identified through the Company’s loan review process. Generally, the Company only evaluates loans individually for impairment if the loan is non-accrual, non-homogeneous and the balance is at least $1.0 million, or if the loan was modified in a TDR. When management determines that foreclosure is probable, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the
reporting date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. If the loan is not collateral dependent, the allowance for credit losses related to individually assessed loans is based on discounted expected cash flows using the loan’s initial effective interest rate.
A loan for which the terms have been modified resulting in a concession by the Company, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties is considered to be a TDR. The allowance for credit losses on a TDR is measured using the same method as all other impaired loans, except that the original interest rate is used to discount the expected cash flows, not the rate specified within the restructuring.
As previously noted, in accordance with the CARES Act, the Company elected to not apply troubled debt restructuring classification to any COVID-19 related loan modifications that occurred after March 1, 2020 to borrowers who were current as of December 31, 2019. Accordingly, these modifications were not classified as TDRs. In addition, for loans modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that did not meet the above criteria (e.g., current payment status at December 31, 2019), the Company applied the guidance included in an interagency statement issued by the bank regulatory agencies. This guidance states that loan modifications performed in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, including loan payment deferrals that are up to six months in duration, that were granted to borrowers who were current as of the implementation date of a loan modification program or modifications granted under government mandated modification programs, are not TDRs.
Loans that have been or are expected to be granted COVID-19 related deferrals or modifications decreased from a peak level of $1.31 billion, or 16.8% of loans, to $207.4 million, or 2.1% of loans. This $207.4 million of loans consists of $9.1 million in a first 90-day deferral period, $51.3 million in a second 90-day deferral period, $121.2 million that required additional payment relief and $25.8 million that have completed their initial deferral periods, but are expected to require ongoing assistance. Included in the $207.4 million of loans, $49.2 million are secured by hotels, $35.9 million are secured by retail properties, $30.4 million are secured by multi-family properties, of which $21.1 million are student housing related, $29.7 million are secured by residential mortgages and $4.9 million are secured by restaurants, with the balance comprised of diverse commercial loans.
For loans acquired that have experienced more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination are considered PCD loans. The Company evaluates acquired loans for deterioration in credit quality based on any of, but not limited to, the following: (1) non-accrual status; (2) troubled debt restructured designation; (3) risk ratings of special mention, substandard or doubtful; (4) watchlist credits; and (5) delinquency status, including loans that are current on acquisition date, but had been previously delinquent. At the acquisition date, an estimate of expected credit losses is made for groups of PCD loans with similar risk characteristics and individual PCD loans without similar risk characteristics. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the initial allowance for credit losses on PCD loans will increase or decrease based on future evaluations, with changes recognized in the provision for credit losses.
Management believes the primary risks inherent in the portfolio are a general decline in the economy, a decline in real estate market values, rising unemployment or a protracted period of elevated unemployment, increasing vacancy rates in commercial investment properties and possible increases in interest rates in the absence of economic improvement. As the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, the effectiveness of medical advances, government programs, and the resulting impact on consumer behavior and employment conditions will have a material bearing on future credit conditions. Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect borrowers’ ability to repay the loans, resulting in increased delinquencies, credit losses and higher levels of provisions. Management considers it important to maintain the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total loans at an acceptable level given current and forecasted economic conditions, interest rates and the composition of the portfolio.
Although management believes that the Company has established and maintained the allowance for credit losses at appropriate levels, additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment and economic forecast. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis giving consideration to forecasted economic factors, historical loss experience and other factors. Such estimates and assumptions are adjusted when facts and circumstances dictate. In addition to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, illiquid credit markets, volatile securities markets, and declines in the housing and commercial real estate markets and the economy in general may increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods. In addition, various regulatory agencies periodically review the adequacy of the Company’s allowance for credit losses as an integral part of their examination process. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance or additional write-downs based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Although management uses the best information available, the level of the allowance for credit losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short-term change.
Going forward, the impact of utilizing the CECL approach to calculate the allowance for credit losses on loans will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of the Company’s loan portfolio, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecast utilized. Material changes to these and other relevant factors may result in greater volatility to the allowance for credit losses, and therefore, greater volatility to the Company’s reported earnings. For the year ended, December 31, 2020, changing economic forecasts attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and projected economic recovery led to provisions for credit losses and off-balance sheet credit exposures. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) for more information on the allowance for credit losses on loans.
The determination of whether deferred tax assets will be realizable is predicated on the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities and estimates of future taxable income. Such estimates are subject to management’s judgment. A valuation allowance is established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will realize deferred tax assets based on the nature and timing of these items. The Company did not require a valuation allowance at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2020
In May 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2019-05, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326); Targeted Transition Relief.” This ASU allows entities to irrevocably elect, upon adoption of ASU 2016-13, the fair value option on financial instruments that (1) were previously recorded at amortized cost and (2) are within the scope of ASC 326-20 if the instruments are eligible for the fair value option under ASC 825-10. The fair value option election does not apply to held-to-maturity debt securities. Entities are required to make this election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. ASU 2019-05 had the same effective date as ASU 2016-13 (i.e., the first quarter of 2020). The adoption of this guidance had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-04, "Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments" which clarifies and improves areas of guidance related to the recently issued standards on credit losses, hedging, recognition and measurement. The most significant provisions of this ASU relate to how companies will estimate expected credit losses under Topic 326 by incorporating (1) expected recoveries of financial assets, including recoveries of amounts expected to be written off and those previously written off, and (2) clarifying that contractual extensions or renewal options that are not unconditionally cancellable by the lender are considered when determining the contractual term over which expected credit losses are measured. ASU No. 2019-04 is effective for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance had no impact related to Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. At January 1, 2020, a $1.3 million allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures was recorded related to extensions on construction loans and is reflected below in the ASU 2016-13 calculation.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, “Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement.” This ASU eliminates, adds and modifies certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. Among the changes, entities will no longer be required to disclose the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, but will be required to disclose the range and weighted average used to develop significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements. ASU No. 2018-13 was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019; early adoption was permitted. Entities are also allowed to elect early adoption of the eliminated or modified disclosure requirements and delay adoption of the new disclosure requirements until their effective date. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” The main objective of this ASU is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The amendments in this ASU require financial assets measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses would represent a valuation account that would be deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The income statement would reflect the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period. The measurement of expected credit losses would be based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and a reasonable and supportable forecast that affect the collectability of the reported amount. An entity will be required to use judgment in determining the relevant information and estimation methods that are appropriate in its circumstances. Furthermore, ASU 2016-13 will necessitate establishing an allowance for expected credit losses on held to maturity debt securities. This also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures, which includes loan commitments, unused lines of credit and other similar instruments. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 are effective for fiscal years, including interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption of
this ASU was permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 involves changing from an "incurred loss" model, which encompasses allowances for current known and inherent losses within the portfolio, to an "expected loss" model (“CECL”), which encompasses allowances for losses expected to be incurred over the life of the portfolio. The Company adopted CECL on January 1, 2020 using the modified retrospective method for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and off-balance sheet ("OBS") credit exposures. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2020 are presented under ASC 326 while prior period amounts continue to be recorded with previously applicable GAAP. The Company recorded a $7.9 million increase to the allowance for credit losses and a $3.2 million liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures, which resulted in an $8.3 million cumulative effect adjustment decrease, net of tax, to retained earnings. With regard to regulatory capital, the Company has elected to utilize the five-year CECL transition, which gives the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay.
Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
ASU 2020-04, "Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848)" ("ASU 2020-04") provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to loan and lease agreements, derivative contracts, and other transactions affected by the anticipated transition away from LIBOR toward new interest rate benchmarks. For transactions that are modified because of reference rate reform and that meet certain scope guidance: (i) modifications of loan agreements should be accounted for by prospectively adjusting the effective interest rate and the modification will be considered "minor" so that any existing unamortized origination fees/costs would carry forward and continue to be amortized; and (ii) modifications of lease agreements should be accounted for as a continuation of the existing agreement with no reassessments of the lease classification and the discount rate or re-measurements of lease payments that otherwise would be required for modifications not accounted for as separate contracts. ASU 2020-04 also provides numerous optional expedients for derivative accounting. ASU 2020-04 is effective March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. An entity may elect to apply ASU 2020-04 for contract modifications as of January 1, 2020, or prospectively from a date within an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020, up to the date that the financial statements are available to be issued. Once elected for a Topic or an Industry Subtopic within the Codification, the amendments in this ASU must be applied prospectively for all eligible contract modifications for that Topic or Industry Subtopic. The Company anticipates this ASU will simplify any modifications we execute between the selected start date (yet to be determined) and December 31, 2022 that are directly related to LIBOR transition by allowing prospective recognition of the continuation of the contract, rather than the extinguishment of the old contract resulting in writing off unamortized fees/costs. In addition, in January 2021 the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01 “Reference Rate Reform - Scope,” which clarified the scope of ASC 848 relating to contract modifications. The Company is evaluating the impacts of this guidance and has not determined whether LIBOR transition and this guidance will have material effects on the Company's business operations and consolidated financial statements.
Analysis of Net Interest Income
Net interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the rates of interest earned on such assets and paid on such liabilities.
Average Balance Sheet. The following table sets forth certain information for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. For the periods indicated, the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest-earning assets and the resultant yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities is expressed both in dollars and rates. No tax equivalent adjustments were made. Average balances are daily averages.
(1) Average outstanding balance amounts are at amortized cost.
(2) Average outstanding balances are net of the allowance for credit losses, deferred loan fees and expenses, and loan premiums and discounts and include non-accrual loans.
(3) Net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.
Rate/Volume Analysis. The following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to: (i) changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); (ii) changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume); and (iii) the net change. The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate.
Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019
Total assets at December 31, 2020 were $12.92 billion, a $3.11 billion increase from December 31, 2019. The increase in total assets was primarily due to $2.20 billion of assets acquired from SB One, which includes $22.4 million of goodwill and $10.0 million of other intangible assets, as well as an increase of $473.2 million related to commercial loans made under the Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP").
The Company’s loan portfolio increased $2.49 billion to $9.82 billion at December 31, 2020, from $7.33 billion at December 31, 2019, which included $1.77 billion of loans acquired from SB One and $473.2 million of PPP loans. For the year ended December 31, 2020, loan originations, including advances on lines of credit, totaled $3.50 billion, compared with $2.83 billion for 2019. The loan portfolio had net increases of $932.7 million in commercial loans, $880.2 million in commercial mortgage loans, $258.8 million in multi-family mortgage loans, $216.5 million in residential mortgage loans and $112.1 million in construction loans.
Commercial loans, consisting of commercial real estate, multi-family, construction and commercial loans, totaled $8.05 billion, accounting for 81.8% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2020, compared to $5.87 billion, or 80.0% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2019. The Company intends to continue to focus on the origination of commercially-oriented loans. Retail loans, which consist of one- to four-family residential mortgage and consumer loans, such as fixed-rate home equity loans and lines of credit, totaled $1.79 billion and accounted for 18.2% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2020, compared to $1.47 billion, or 20.0%, of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2019.
The Company participates in loans originated by other banks, including participations designated as Shared National Credits (“SNC”). The Company’s gross commitments and outstanding balances as a participant in SNCs were $225.4 million and $110.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, one SNC relationship was classified as
substandard. Our share of the gross commitments and outstanding balances for this substandard SNC relationship totaled $10.4 million.
The Company had outstanding junior lien mortgages totaling $174.0 million at December 31, 2020. Of this total, 17 loans totaling $1.2 million were 90 days or more delinquent, and were allocated total loss reserves of $22,590.
At December 31, 2020, the allowance for credit losses on loans was $101.5 million, representing 1.03% of total loans, or 1.09% of total loans excluding PPP, compared to $55.5 million, or 0.76% of total loans, prior to the adoption of CECL at December 31, 2019. The allowance for credit losses on loans increased $45.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in the allowance for credit losses was attributable to elevated provisions for credit losses primarily due to the current weak economic forecast attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and the adoption of CECL, along with $15.5 million and $13.6 million additions to the allowance for credit losses for loans and PCD loans, respectively, related to the acquisition of the SB One loan portfolio. The Company incurred net charge-offs of $5.3 million, compared to net-charge-offs of $13.1 million for the prior year.
Total non-performing loans at December 31, 2020 were $87.1 million, or 0.89% of total loans, compared with $40.2 million, or 0.55% of total loans at December 31, 2019. The increase in non-performing loans in 2020 reflects the effects of the protracted duration of the pandemic and related government response, and the attendant increased uncertainty of affected borrowers’ ability to repay all contractually due principal and interest. At December 31, 2020, impaired loans totaled $86.0 million with related specific reserves of $9.0 million, compared with impaired loans totaling $70.6 million with related specific reserves of $5.1 million at December 31, 2019. Within total impaired loans, there were $43.7 million of loans for which the present value of expected future cash flows or current collateral valuations exceeded the carrying amounts of the loans and for which no specific reserves were required in accordance with GAAP.

At December 31, 2020, non-performing commercial mortgage loans consisted of 20 loans at December 31, 2020. Of these 20 loans, 11 loans totaling $11.3 million were PCD loans. The largest non-performing commercial mortgage loan was an $11.5 million loan secured by a first mortgage on a property located in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. This loan is currently paying in accordance with its restructured terms.
Non-performing commercial loans increased $17.0 million to $42.1 million at December 31, 2020, from $25.2 million at December 31, 2019.

Of these non-performing commercial loans, 16 were PCD loans totaling $5.5 million. The largest non-performing commercial loan relationship was a Shared National Credit ("SNC") relationship, which consisted of three loans to a restaurant group with our share totaling outstanding balances of $10.4 million at December 31, 2020. All of these loans are unsecured/non-real estate secured. These loans are currently not paying in accordance with their restructured terms. A new modification/forbearance agreement is currently being negotiated.
Non-performing construction loans totaled $1.4 million at December 31, 2020. Non-performing construction loans at December 31, 2020 consisted of two PCD loans.
At December 31, 2020, the Company held $4.5 million of foreclosed assets, compared with $2.7 million at December 31, 2019. Foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of the outstanding loan balance at the time of foreclosure or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. During the year ended December 31, 2020, there were three additions to foreclosed assets with an aggregate carrying value of $2.6 million and 12 properties sold with an aggregate carrying value of $2.5 million and valuation charges of $693,000. Foreclosed assets acquired from SB One totaled $2.4 million.
Non-performing assets totaled $91.6 million, or 0.71% of total assets at December 31, 2020, compared to $42.9 million, or 0.44% of total assets at December 31, 2019. If the non-accrual loans had performed in accordance with their original terms, interest income would have increased by $3.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The amount of cash basis interest income that was recognized on impaired loans during the year ended December 31, 2020 was not material.
Total deposits increased $2.74 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $9.84 billion. The increase in total deposits consisted of $1.76 billion of deposits acquired from SB One and additional net deposit growth of $977.4 million. Total core deposits, consisting of savings and demand deposit accounts, increased $2.38 billion to $8.74 billion at December 31, 2020, while total time deposits increased $360.1 million to $1.09 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase in core deposits for the year ended December 31, 2020 was comprised of a $787.2 million increase in non-interest bearing demand deposits, a $716.2 million increase in interest bearing demand deposits, a $507.2 million increase in money market deposits and a $364.4 million increase in savings deposits. In addition to the deposit relationships acquired from SB One, core deposit growth benefited from the deposit of PPP loan proceeds and government stimulus payments. The increase in time deposits was largely
the result of $577.3 million acquired from SB One, partially offset by the outflow of time deposits totaling $217.2 million. Core deposits represented 88.9% of total deposits at December 31, 2020, compared to 89.7% at December 31, 2019.
Borrowed funds increased $50.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to $1.18 billion. The increase for the period was primarily due to $201.6 million of borrowings acquired from SB One, partially offset by the replacement of wholesale funding with deposits. Borrowed funds represented 9.1% of total assets at December 31, 2020, a decrease from 11.5% at December 31, 2019.
Stockholders’ equity increased $206.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 to $1.62 billion, primarily due to the issuance of 12,788,370 shares of common stock related to the acquisition of SB One, net income earned for the period and an increase in unrealized gains on available for sale debt securities, partially offset by dividends paid to stockholders, the charge to equity of $8.3 million, net of tax, related to the adoption of CECL effective January 1, 2020 to establish initial allowances against credit losses on loans and off-balance sheet credit exposures, and common stock repurchases. For the year ended December 31, 2020, common stock repurchases totaled 1.3 million shares at an average cost of $16.59, of which 49,461 shares, at an average cost of $19.69, were made in connection with withholding to cover income taxes on the vesting of stock-based compensation. At December 31, 2020, 262,927 shares remained eligible for repurchase under the current authorization. Following completion of the current authorization, a new authorization will commence for the repurchase of up to 5% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, or approximately 3.9 million shares.
Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019
General. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $97.0 million, compared to $112.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $1.39 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.74 for 2019.
The Company’s earnings for the year ended December 31, 2020 were aided by the July 31, 2020 acquisition of SB One which added $2.20 billion to total assets, $1.77 billion to loans, and $1.76 billion to deposits. Earnings for the year were also affected by the January 1, 2020 adoption of a new accounting standard requiring the current recognition of allowances for losses expected to be incurred over the life of covered assets (“CECL”). The acquisition of SB One and changing economic forecasts attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and projected economic recovery significantly impacted provisions for credit losses and off-balance sheet credit exposures and resulted in year-over-year fluctuations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, provisions for credit losses on loans were $29.7 million and provisions for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures were $1.8 million, reflecting the acquisition of SB One and the economic challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 included pre-tax non-recurring charges related to the acquisition and integration of SB One totaling $6.3 million and direct COVID-19 related costs such as supplemental pay for branch employees and personal protective equipment totaling $1.4 million.
Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $14.6 million to $312.6 million for 2020, from $298.0 million for 2019. The interest rate spread decreased 18 basis points to 2.92% for 2020, from 3.10% for 2019. The net interest margin decreased 26 basis points to 3.09% for 2020, compared to 3.35% for 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the net interest margin was favorably impacted by the net assets acquired from SB One, partially offset by year-over-year compression in the net interest margin as the decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets outpaced the decline in the Company's cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The degree of net interest margin compression was tempered by growth in both average loans outstanding and lower-costing average interest-bearing and non-interest bearing core deposits, which mitigated the Company's need to utilize higher-cost sources to fund average interest-earning assets. In the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized the accelerated accretion of $2.2 million in interest income upon the prepayment of loans which had been non-accruing.
Interest income decreased $8.2 million to $363.3 million for 2020, compared to $371.5 million for 2019. The decrease in interest income was attributable to the downward repricing of certain adjustable rate assets and lower rates on newly originated loans, partially offset by interest income from the SB One loan portfolio. Average interest-earning assets increased $1.23 billion to $10.12 billion for 2020, compared to $8.89 billion for 2019. The increase in average earning assets was largely due to a $1.18 billion increase in average outstanding loan balances to $8.37 billion for 2020, attributable to the loan portfolios acquired from SB One and PPP loan originations. The yield on interest-earning assets decreased 59 basis points to 3.59% for 2020, from 4.18% for 2019. The weighted average yield on total loans decreased 64 basis points to 3.87% for 2020 and the weighted average yield on available for sale debt securities decreased 48 basis points to 2.08% for 2020, from 2.56% for 2019. The weighted average yield on FHLBNY stock decreased to 6.00% for 2020, compared to 6.62% for 2019.
Interest expense decreased $22.8 million to $50.7 million for 2020, from $73.5 million for 2019. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by an increase in average interest-bearing deposits. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased 41 basis points to 0.67% for 2020, compared to 2019. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits decreased 31 basis points to 0.53% for 2020, from 0.84% for 2019. The average rate paid on borrowings decreased 74 basis points to 1.36% for 2020, from 2.10% for 2019. The average rate paid on subordinated debentures assumed in the SB One acquisition was 4.90% for 2020. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $932.9 million to $6.38 billion for 2020, from $5.44 billion for 2019. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased $834.6 million to $7.61 billion for 2020, compared to $6.78 billion for 2019. Within average interest-bearing deposits, average interest-bearing core deposits increased $866.1 million to $4.64 billion for 2020, compared with 2019, while average time deposits increased $66.8 million for 2020, compared with 2019. Average non-interest bearing demand deposits increased $481.7 million to $1.98 billion for 2020, from $1.50 billion for 2019. Average outstanding borrowings decreased $108.7 million to $1.23 billion for 2020, compared to 2019. Average outstanding subordinated debentures for 2020 was $10.4 million.
Provision for Credit Losses. Provisions for credit losses are charged to operations in order to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level management considers necessary to absorb projected credit losses that may arise over the expected term of each loan in the portfolio. In determining the level of the allowance for credit losses, management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information from internal and external sources relating to past events, current conditions and a reasonable and supportable forecast. The amount of the allowance is based on estimates, and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or later events change. Management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis and makes provisions for credit losses, if necessary, in order to maintain the valuation of the allowance.
The provision for loan losses was $29.7 million in 2020, compared to $13.1 million in 2019. Net charge-offs for 2020 were $5.3 million, compared to $13.1 million for 2019. Total charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $7.9 million, compared to $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $2.6 million, compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in the provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was related to the January 1, 2020 adoption of CECL, the current weak economic forecast attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and a $15.5 million provision for credit losses related to the acquisition of the SB One loan portfolio. Future credit loss provisions are subject to significant uncertainty given the undetermined nature of prospective changes in economic conditions, as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold. The effectiveness of medical advances, government programs, and the resulting impact on consumer behavior and employment conditions will have a material bearing on future credit conditions and reserve requirements.
Non-Interest Income. For the year ended December 31, 2020, non-interest income totaled $72.4 million, an increase of $8.6 million, compared to the same period in 2019. Other income increased $6.2 million to $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a $4.3 million increase in net fees on loan-level interest rate swap transactions, a $931,000 increase in net gains on the sale of fixed assets, a $723,000 increase in net gains on the sale of foreclosed real estate and a $451,000 increase in net gains from the sale of loans. Insurance agency income totaled $3.5 million following the July 31, 2020 acquisition of SB One. Wealth management income increased $3.2 million to $25.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $22.5 million for the same period in 2019, primarily due to growth in assets under management from the April 2019 T&L acquisition, combined with an increase in the market value of assets under management. Partially offsetting these increases, fee income decreased $4.5 million to $23.8 million, compared to the same period in 2019, largely due to a $2.6 million decrease in deposit related fee income, a $1.7 million decrease in prepayment fees on commercial loans and a $400,000 decrease in other loan-related fee income, all largely due to the effects of COVID-19 on consumer and business activities.
Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $227.7 million, an increase of $26.1 million from 2019. Non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, included $6.3 million of non-recurring costs related to the acquisition and integration of SB One and $1.4 million of COVID-19 related expenses. Compensation and benefits expense increased $14.0 million to $130.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $116.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to an increase in salary expense associated with the addition of former SB One and T&L employees, an increase in severance expense, an increase in the accrual for incentive compensation, and COVID-19 supplemental pay for branch employees, partially offset by the increased deferral of salary expense related to PPP loan originations and a decrease in stock-based compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2020, data processing costs increased $3.9 million to $20.8 million, compared with 2019, primarily due to non-recurring core system conversion costs related to the SB One acquisition and increases in software subscription service expense and online banking costs. Other operating expenses increased $2.4 million to $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $33.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was largely due to increases in consulting and legal expenses primarily related to the SB One acquisition, an increase in debit card maintenance expense and a market valuation
adjustment on foreclosed real estate, partially offset by a $2.8 million prior year estimated fair value adjustment of the contingent consideration related to the T&L acquisition. FDIC insurance expense increased $1.8 million to $3.1 million for year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1.3 million for the same period in 2019, largely due to the receipt of the small bank assessment credit in the prior year, the addition of SB One and increases in both the insurance assessment rate and total assets subject to assessment. For the year ended December 31, 2020, credit loss expense for off-balance sheet credit exposures totaled $1.8 million based upon the January 1, 2020 adoption of CECL and the subsequent changes in loss factors due to changes in the economic forecast, the pipeline of loans approved awaiting closing and the availability on committed lines of credit. Additionally, net occupancy costs increased $1.2 million to $27.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase in rent expense, a portion of which was related to the addition of SB One facilities, and a full year of the T&L acquisition, while the amortization of intangibles increased $685,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 2019, mainly due to an increase in the customer relationship intangible amortization attributable to the acquisition of SB One Insurance Agency, partially offset by scheduled reductions in amortization.
Income Tax Expense. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company’s income tax expense was $30.6 million, compared with $34.5 million, for the same period in 2019. The Company’s effective tax rate was 24.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 23.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in tax expense and the higher effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was largely the result of corresponding changes in taxable income, while the changes in the effective tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with the same period in 2019 were primarily due to the proportion of income derived from tax exempt sources to total pre-tax income.
Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018
General. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $112.6 million, compared to $118.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Basic and diluted earnings per share were both $1.74 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.82 for 2018.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company’s earnings were adversely impacted by a $2.0 million, or $0.03 per basic and diluted share, net of tax expense, increase in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration related to the April 1, 2019 acquisition of T&L. The earn-out of this contingent consideration is based upon T&L achieving certain revenue growth and retention targets over a three-year period from the date of acquisition. Based upon recent performance and improved projections for the remaining measurement period, an increase to the fair value of the contingent liability was warranted. At December 31, 2019, the contingent liability was $9.4 million, with maximum potential future payments totaling $11.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, a non-recurring $1.9 million tax benefit was recorded stemming from the Company's completion of a cost segregation study that assigned shorter taxable lives to certain fixed assets. This benefit contributed $0.03 per basic and diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, the Company realized a $1.6 million, or $0.02 per share, net of tax gain on the sale of Visa Class B common shares in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Net Interest Income. Net interest income decreased $2.7 million to $298.0 million for 2019, from $300.7 million for 2018. The interest rate spread decreased 10 basis points to 3.10% for 2019, from 3.20% for 2018. The net interest margin decreased four basis points to 3.35% for 2019, compared to 3.39% for 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the decrease in net interest income was primarily due to compression in the net interest margin as the increase in the cost of the Company’s average interest-bearing deposits and borrowings outpaced the improvement in the yield on average total loans. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was aided by the recognition of $2.2 million in interest income, in the second quarter of 2019, upon the prepayment of loans which had previously been non-accruing.
Interest income increased $11.6 million to $371.5 million for 2019, compared to $359.8 million for 2018. The increase in interest income was attributable to an increase in average earning asset balances and an increase in the yield on average interest-earning assets. Average interest-earning assets increased $29.4 million to $8.89 billion for 2019, compared to $8.87 billion for 2018. The increase in average earning assets was largely attributable to a $47.8 million increase in the average balance of the total investment portfolio. This was partially offset by an $18.3 million decrease in average outstanding loan balances to $7.19 billion for 2019 from $7.21 billion for 2018. The yield on interest-earning assets increased 12 basis points to 4.18% for 2019, from 4.06% for 2018, mainly due to increases in the weighted average yields on total loans and the available for sale debt securities portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in FHLBNY stock yield. The weighted average yield on total loans increased 15 basis points to 4.51% for 2019 and the weighted average yield on available for sale debt securities increased seven basis points to 2.56% for 2019, from 2.49% for 2018. The weighted average yield on FHLBNY stock decreased to 6.62% for 2019, compared to 6.78% for 2018.
Interest expense increased $14.3 million to $73.5 million for 2019, from $59.2 million for 2018. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities and an increase in average interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a decline in average borrowings. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities
increased 22 basis points to 1.08% for 2019, compared to 2018. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased 26 basis points to 0.84% for 2019, from 0.58% for 2018. The average rate paid on borrowings increased 25 basis points to 2.10% for 2019, from 1.85% for 2018. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $125.1 million to $5.44 billion for 2019, from $5.32 billion for 2018. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities decreased $74.2 million to $6.78 billion for 2019, compared to $6.85 billion for 2018. Within average interest-bearing deposits, average time deposits increased $129.7 million for 2019, compared with 2018, while average interest-bearing core deposits decreased $4.6 million to $4.64 billion for 2019, compared with 2018. Average non-interest bearing demand deposits increased $39.0 million to $1.50 billion for 2019, from $1.46 billion for 2018. Average outstanding borrowings decreased $199.3 million to $1.34 billion for 2019, compared to 2018.
Provision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses was $13.1 million in 2019, compared to $23.7 million in 2018. The decrease in the provision for loan losses was primarily attributable to a $14.9 million loss related to a commercial borrower that filed a Chapter 7 petition in bankruptcy on March 27, 2018 for a liquidation of assets. Net charge-offs for 2019 were $13.1 million, compared to $28.3 million for 2018. Total charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $15.0 million, compared to $30.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2019, were $1.9 million, compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 was $55.5 million, or 0.76% of total loans, compared to $55.6 million, or 0.77% of total loans, at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans were 0.55%, compared to 0.35% at December 31, 2018. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.44% at December 31, 2019, compared to 0.28% at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, non-performing loans were $40.2 million, compared to $25.7 million at December 31, 2018, and non-performing assets were $42.9 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $27.3 million at December 31, 2018.
Non-Interest Income. For the year ended December 31, 2019, non-interest income totaled $63.8 million, an increase of $5.1 million, compared to the same period in 2018. Wealth management income increased $4.5 million to $22.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $18.0 million for the same period in 2018, primarily due to fees earned from assets under management acquired in the T&L transaction, partially offset by a decrease in managed mutual fund fees. Other income increased $1.7 million to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a $2.6 million increase in net fees on loan-level interest rate swap transactions, partially offset by decreases of $659,000 and $353,000 in net gains on the sale of foreclosed real estate and net gains on the sale of loans, respectively. Income from BOLI increased $783,000 to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, due to an increase in benefit claims and greater equity valuations, while fee income increased $237,000 to $28.3 million, compared to the same period in 2018, largely due to a $1.0 million increase in prepayment fees on commercial loans, partially offset by a $264,000 decrease in debit card revenue, a $144,000 decrease in income from non-deposit investment products and a $125,000 decrease in deposit related fee income. Partially offsetting increases in other income, net gains on securities transactions decreased $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to the sale of Visa Class B common shares in 2018.
Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $201.6 million, an increase of $9.8 million from 2018. Compensation and benefits expense increased $5.4 million to $116.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $111.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was due to additional compensation expense arising from the T&L acquisition, increased salary expense related to annual merit increases and additions of risk management and compliance professionals, along with increases in the accrual for incentive compensation and stock-based compensation. Other operating expenses increased $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $31.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a $2.8 million increase in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration related to the T&L purchase transaction. Data processing costs increased $2.2 million to $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared with 2018, primarily due to increases in software subscription service expense and implementation costs. Additionally, net occupancy costs increased $839,000, to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to an increase in rent expense, a portion of which was related to the T&L acquisition, while the amortization of intangibles increased $613,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared with 2018, largely due to an increase in the customer relationship intangible amortization attributable to the acquisition of T&L. Partially offsetting these increases in non-interest expense, FDIC insurance expense decreased $2.2 million to $1.3 million for year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $3.5 million for the same period in 2018, largely due to the receipt of the small bank assessment credit for the second and third quarters of 2019 and the discontinuance of the FICO assessment.
Income Tax Expense. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company’s income tax expense was $34.5 million, compared with $25.5 million, for the same period in 2018. The Company’s effective tax rate was 23.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared with 17.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in tax expense and the higher effective tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2019 were primarily attributable to the effects of a technical bulletin issued by the New Jersey Division of Taxation in the second quarter of 2019 that specified treatment of real estate investment trusts in connection with combined reporting for New Jersey corporate business tax purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2018,
tax expense and the effective tax rate were favorably impacted by a non-recurring $1.9 million tax benefit related to the Company's completion of a cost segregation study that assigned shorter taxable lives to select fixed assets.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity refers to the Company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet financial obligations to its depositors, to fund loans and securities purchases, deposit outflows and operating expenses. Sources of funds include scheduled amortization of loans, loan prepayments, scheduled maturities of investments, cash flows from mortgage-backed securities and the ability to borrow funds from the FHLBNY and approved broker-dealers.
Cash flows from loan payments and maturing investment securities are fairly predictable sources of funds. Changes in interest rates, local economic conditions, the COVID-19 pandemic and related government response and the competitive marketplace can influence loan prepayments, prepayments on mortgage-backed securities and deposit flows. For each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, loan repayments totaled $2.60 billion and $2.71 billion, respectively.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has escalated the monitoring of deposit behavior, utilization of credit lines, and borrowing capacity with the FHLBNY and FRBNY, and is enhancing its collateral position with these funding sources.
Commercial real estate loans, multi-family loans, commercial loans, one- to four-family residential loans and consumer loans are the primary investments of the Company. Purchasing securities for the investment portfolio is a secondary use of funds and the investment portfolio is structured to complement and facilitate the Company’s lending activities and ensure adequate liquidity. Loan originations and purchases totaled $3.50 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $2.83 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Purchases for the investment portfolio totaled $298.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $137.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020, the Bank had outstanding loan commitments to borrowers of $1.99 billion, including undisbursed home equity lines and personal credit lines of $212.4 million.
Total deposits increased $2.74 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. Deposit activity is affected by changes in interest rates, competitive pricing and product offerings in the marketplace, local economic conditions, customer confidence and other factors such as stock market volatility. Certificate of deposit accounts that are scheduled to mature within one year totaled $886.0 million at December 31, 2020. Based on its current pricing strategy and customer retention experience, the Bank expects to retain a significant share of these accounts. The Bank manages liquidity on a daily basis and expects to have sufficient cash to meet all of its funding requirements.
As of December 31, 2020, the Bank exceeded all minimum regulatory capital requirements. At December 31, 2020, the Bank’s leverage (Tier 1) capital ratio was 8.75%. FDIC regulations require banks to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets of 4.00%. At December 31, 2020, the Bank’s total risk-based capital ratio was 11.21%. Under current regulations, the minimum required ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets is 10.50%. A bank is considered to be well-capitalized if it has a leverage (Tier 1) capital ratio of at least 5.00% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.00%.
Off-Balance Sheet and Contractual Obligations
Off-balance sheet and contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020, are summarized below:
