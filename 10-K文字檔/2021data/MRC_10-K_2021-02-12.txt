Overview
We are the largest distributor of pipe, valves, and fittings ("PVF") and other infrastructure products and services to the energy industry, based on sales. We also sell our products and provide our services to industrial applications. We provide innovative supply chain solutions and technical product expertise to customers globally through our leading position across each of our diversified end-markets including the following sectors:
● gas utilities (storage and distribution of natural gas)
● downstream and industrial (crude oil refining and petrochemical and chemical processing and general industrials)
● upstream production (exploration, production and extraction of underground oil and gas)
● midstream pipeline (gathering, processing and transmission of oil and gas)
We offer over 200,000 SKUs, including an extensive array of PVF, oilfield supply, valve automation and modification, measurement, instrumentation and other general and specialty products from our global network of over 10,000 suppliers. With 100 years of history, our over 2,600 employees serve approximately 12,000 customers through approximately 230 service locations including regional distribution centers, branches, corporate offices and third party pipe yards, where we often deploy pipe near customer locations.
Our customers use the PVF and other infrastructure products that we supply in mission critical process applications that require us to provide a high degree of product knowledge, technical expertise and comprehensive value-added services to our customers. We seek to provide best-in-class service and a one-stop shop for customers by satisfying the most complex, multi- site needs of many of the largest companies in the energy sector as their primary PVF supplier. We believe the critical role we play in our customers' supply chain, together with our extensive product and service offerings, broad global presence, customer-linked scalable information systems and efficient distribution capabilities, serve to solidify our long-standing customer relationships and drive our growth. As a result, we have an average relationship of over 25 years with our 25 largest customers.
Key Drivers of Our Business
Our revenue is predominantly derived from the sale of PVF and other oilfield and industrial supplies to the energy sector globally. In addition to general economic conditions, our business is, therefore, dependent upon both the current conditions and future prospects in the energy industry and, in particular, maintenance and expansionary operating and capital expenditures by our customers in the gas utilities, downstream and industrial, upstream production and midstream pipeline sectors of the industry. Long-term growth in spending has been driven by several factors, including demand growth for petroleum and petroleum derived products, underinvestment in global energy infrastructure, growth in shale and unconventional exploration and production (“E&P”) activity, and anticipated strength in the oil, natural gas, refined products and petrochemical sectors. The outlook for future oil, natural gas, refined products and petrochemical PVF spending is influenced by numerous factors, including the following:
●
Energy Infrastructure Integrity and Modernization. Currently, gas utilities is our largest sector by sales. Activity with customers in this market is dependent on new residential and commercial development as well as upgrades of existing infrastructure. Maintenance of an aging network of pipelines is a critical requirement for these customers irrespective of broader economic conditions. As a result, this business tends to be more stable over time and moves independently of commodity prices.
● Oil and Natural Gas Prices. Sales of PVF and related infrastructure products to the oil and natural gas industry constitute a significant portion of our sales. As a result, we depend upon the oil and natural gas industry and its ability and willingness to make maintenance and capital expenditures to explore for, produce and process oil, natural gas and refined products. Oil and natural gas prices, both current and projected, along with the costs necessary to produce oil and gas, impact other drivers of our business, including capital spending by customers, additions to and maintenance of pipelines, refinery utilization and petrochemical processing activity.
●
Economic Conditions. The demand for the products we distribute is dependent on the general economy, the energy sector and other factors. Changes in the general economy or in the energy sector (domestically or internationally) can cause demand for the products we distribute to materially change.
●
Manufacturer and Distributor Inventory Levels of PVF and Related Products. Manufacturer and distributor inventory levels of PVF and related products can change significantly from period to period. Increased inventory levels by manufacturers or other distributors can cause an oversupply of PVF and related products in the industry sectors we serve and reduce the prices that we are able to charge for the products we distribute. Reduced prices, in turn, would likely reduce our profitability. Conversely, decreased manufacturer inventory levels may ultimately lead to increased demand for our products and would likely result in increased sales volumes and overall profitability.
●
Steel Prices, Availability and Supply and Demand. Fluctuations in steel prices can lead to volatility in the pricing of the products we distribute, especially carbon steel line pipe products, which can influence the buying patterns of our customers. A majority of the products we distribute contain various types of steel. The worldwide supply and demand for these products, or other steel products that we do not supply, impacts the pricing and availability of our products and, ultimately, our sales and operating profitability.
Recent Trends and Outlook
During 2020, the average oil price of West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) decreased to $39.16 per barrel from $56.98 per barrel in 2019. Natural gas prices decreased to an average price of $2.03/Mcf (Henry Hub) for 2020 compared to $2.56/Mcf (Henry Hub) for 2019. North American drilling rig activity decreased 52% in 2020 compared to 2019. U.S. well completions were down 49% in 2020 as compared to 2019.
The energy industry, and our business in turn, is cyclical in nature. In 2019, our customers demonstrated an increased focus on returns, which has affected the risk assessment related to new projects and resulted in a more disciplined approach to spending that continues to impact each of our business sectors with the exception of gas utilities. In the first half of 2020, demand for oil and natural gas declined sharply as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As various governments implemented COVID-19 isolation orders, transportation use declined, energy use declined and manufacturing declined. As a result, oil consumption dropped dramatically. At the same time, OPEC and other oil producing nations were initially unable to reach an agreement on oil production levels. This lack of agreement, between Saudi Arabia and Russia in particular, escalated concerns over the potential for oversupply of oil during a period of weakened demand thereby causing a significant, sustained decline in commodity prices. Although major oil-producing nations subsequently responded by reducing oil production, the expected level of oil demand in the near term is projected to be substantially lower than pre-pandemic levels. Oil prices have recently improved due to near-term OPEC production cuts, but there remains significant uncertainty regarding the timing and extent of a recovery. The pace of demand recovery could still possibly slow or pause as a result of additional waves of pandemic outbreak or heightened pandemic control measures. The possibility of a global recession or depression still exists and, over the longer term, we could experience a structural shift in the global economy and its demand for oil and natural gas as a result of changes in the way people work, travel and interact. As a result of these factors, based on an average of industry research estimates, there was a decrease in oil and gas industry spending in 2020 of 32% globally, including approximately 45% in the U.S. upstream production market. These reductions in spending directly impact both the upstream production and midstream pipeline components of our business. In addition, we have seen our customers in the downstream and industrial sector seek to defer turnarounds and routine maintenance as well as idle facilities in order to preserve liquidity and comply with COVID-19 related limitations on employee activities. Furthermore, 79% of our business is concentrated in the U.S. where the majority of industry spending reductions occurred. Given these developments, the risk of resurgence of the COVID-19 virus and the continuing focus on capital discipline by oil and gas exploration and production operators, we experienced a sharp decline in sales beginning in the second quarter of 2020 and expect the market to remain challenged until there is a step-change improvement related to COVID-19 concerns, improving the outlook for global oil demand.
Notwithstanding the ongoing uncertainty, recent spending plan estimates by sell-side research analysts indicate possible outcomes ranging from a modest, single-digit improvement in U.S. upstream spending to a potential decline of up to 10% in 2021. While the mid-point of this range suggests a possible year-over-year decline in activity, it would represent an increase in activity as compared to recent pandemic-impacted quarters.
We play a critical role in supporting our customers and the energy industry throughout the cycles. We believe that carbon-based energy will continue to play a critical role in supporting economic growth, particularly in developing countries, and that oil and gas demand will continue to be significant in the coming decades. The U.S. EIA in its Reference Case published in the International Energy Outlook 2019 projects world energy consumption rising by 50% between 2018 and 2050. This Reference Case remains the latest EIA case for world energy markets; however, it was issued before the COVID-19 pandemic and may change to take into account energy use declines during the pandemic. Even so, we believe that oil and gas will continue to be in demand for some time. Even as the EIA projects in its Reference Case that renewables become the most used energy source by 2050, the EIA also projects petroleum and other liquids to rise more than 20% and natural gas to rise more than 40% in that timeframe. This would require an increase in oil and gas to meet the rise in demand from current levels, which would continue to provide a robust market for our existing goods and services. Furthermore, our largest customers are among the leading investors in renewable energy technology. As they further rebalance their capital investment from traditional, carbon-based energy to alternative sources, we expect to continue to supply them and enhance our product and service offering as needed to support their changing requirements.
The gas utility sector of our business which is independent of oil and gas commodity prices was also initially impacted by certain customer activity delays due to COVID-19 concerns but has not experienced any material budget cuts or project cancellations. In the second half of the year we saw a modest rebound in sales for this sector and expect this business to continue to grow in 2021 due to recent market share gains and higher activity levels as COVID-19 concerns begin to diminish.
Because of the challenging environment in 2020, we took a number of actions to further reduce our operating costs. These steps included the following:
●
A voluntary early retirement program and an involuntary reduction in force to reduce headcount
●
Ongoing freezes on hiring and compensation increases
●
An indefinite suspension of the company’s matching provision for the 401(k) and RSP programs for its U.S. and Canadian employees respectively
●
Reductions in annual bonus incentive targets and resulting payouts for both executive management and eligible employees
● A 30% reduction in 2020 equity grants to non-executive directors
● For eligible executives and employees, a reduction in the long-term incentive awards for 2021 that the Company grants to them pursuant to the Company’s 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan
● Management and employee furloughs
● Closure of certain branches and distribution centers where customer spending demand does not warrant continuation of those operations as we continue to adjust our distribution network as needed
● Continued cost reductions and efficiency efforts throughout the Company
In addition to these efforts, we have and continue actively managing our investment in working capital which allows us to generate cash and reduce our indebtedness. In the fourth quarter, we completed the sale leaseback of four facilities which generated $29 million of net proceeds which we also used to reduce our indebtedness. For the year, we generated $261 million of cash from operations and reduced our net debt by almost half to $264 million.
During 2020, we closed 27 facilities and took other actions to reduce our costs associated with leased branches. As a result of these actions, we incurred charges totaling $14 million related to impairment of right of use assets, lease abandonment and charges associated with contractual obligations under lease agreements. Through these facility closures and other reductions in force, we have reduced headcount by approximately 600 employees. In connection with these reductions, we have incurred severance costs of $14 million.
During the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, we have continued to operate our business. Our video and audio conferencing and enterprise resource planning and other operational systems have enabled our office employees to work from home, performing their job functions with minimal disruption or impact on our internal control environment. We required our employees to work from home as a result of governmental isolation orders and, in many cases, in advance of those orders for the health and safety of our employees. We have limited employee travel, with few exceptions, to local deliveries of our products. Our warehouses and regional distribution centers have remained open. Under various isolation orders by national, state, provincial and local governments, we have been exempted as an "essential' business as the products we sell are necessary for the maintenance and functioning of the energy infrastructure. We have taken measures to safeguard the health and welfare of our employees, including (among other things) social distancing measures while at work, certain screening, providing personal protection equipment such as face masks and hand sanitizer and providing "deep" cleaning services at Company facilities. As of February 2, 2021, of our approximate 2,600 employees, we had 10 employees with current cases of COVID-19. If we were to develop a COVID-19 outbreak at one of our facilities, we have plans to isolate those in contact with the impacted employees and to either staff the facility with employees from other facilities or supply product to customers from other facilities. We monitor guidelines of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control ("CDC") and other authorities on an ongoing basis, and as various governmental isolation orders evolve, we continue to review our operational plans to continue operating our business while addressing the health and safety of our employees and those with whom our business comes into contact.
As a distribution business, we have also closely monitored the ability of our suppliers and transportation providers to continue the functioning of our supply chain, particularly in cases where there are limited alternative sources of supply. While there were initially some temporary interruptions of manufacturing for some of our products in the Spring of 2020, especially those who manufacture product or components in China, South Korea and Italy, many of these manufacturers have now resumed production. We have not experienced significant delays by transportation providers. Our inventory position for most products has allowed us to continue supply to most customers with little interruption. In those instances where there is interruption, we are working with our customers to discuss the impact of the COVID-19 delay. We continue to monitor the situation and have ongoing dialogue with our customers regarding the status of impacted orders.
In recent years, the United States imposed tariffs on imports of some products that we distribute. Although these actions generally cause the price we pay for products to increase, we are generally able to leverage long-standing relationships with our suppliers and the volume of our purchases to receive market competitive pricing. In addition, our contracts with customers generally allow us to react quickly to price increases through mechanisms that enable us to pass those increases along to customers as they occur. Of course, the price increases that tariffs and quotas engender may be offset by the pricing impacts of lower demand that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused. These issues are dynamic and continue to evolve. To the extent our products are further impacted by pricing fluctuations caused by tariffs and quotas, the ultimate impact on our revenue and cost of sales, which is determined using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") inventory costing methodology, remains subject to uncertainty and volatility.
In January 2021, a new U.S. President took office and new U.S. Congress was seated. They have publicly made statements regarding the desire to support alternative energy sources such as solar, wind and “green” hydrogen, reduce U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases and generally address climate change. To that end, the new administration has implemented executive orders for the U.S. to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which presumably will require the U.S. to set greenhouse gas reduction goals and enact policies to meet those goals. It has also announced an aggressive policy agenda to change the tax system, increase corporate and other income taxes, modify the relationships between the United States and other countries and make changes that reverse actions taken by the prior President. While at first impression these policies could impact demand for our oil and gas customers’ product and further regulate the industry, it is not clear that these actions will actually have that impact. For instance, the new President has signed an executive order placing a moratorium on the leasing of U.S. federal lands for oil and gas exploration and production. However, given the current supply and demand for oil and gas, there does not appear to be a robust market for any such new leasing by our customers. Until specific laws are passed, executive actions are taken or federal regulatory action is enacted, it is unclear what impact these policies will have on our business.
Effective January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom formally exited the European Union (“EU”). Following the exit, there was a transition period until December 31, 2020. During the transition period, the UK's trading relationship with the EU remained the same while the two sides negotiated a free trade deal. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement was signed on December 30, 2020 between the EU and the United Kingdom. Although this agreement is still awaiting ratification by the European Parliament, it has been applied provisionally since January 1, 2021 when the transition period ended. Although we don't expect these developments to have a meaningful impact on our business, we continue to maintain a physical presence in both the U.K. and EU member states that allow us to operate and to serve our customers as needed. In 2020, 3.0% of our revenue was derived from our U.K. business.
We determine backlog by the amount of unshipped customer orders, either specific or general in nature, which the customer may revise or cancel in certain instances. The table below details our backlog by segment (in millions):
There can be no assurance that the backlog amounts will ultimately be realized as revenue or that we will earn a profit on the backlog of orders, but we expect that substantially all of the sales in our backlog will be realized within twelve months.

Sales. Sales reflect consideration we are entitled to for goods and services when control of those goods and services is transferred to our customers. Our sales were $2,560 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $3,662 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $1,102 million, or 30%, decrease included a $6 million unfavorable impact from the weakening of foreign currencies in areas where we operate relative to the U.S. dollar.
U.S. Segment-Our U.S. sales decreased $933 million to $2,023 million for 2020 from $2,956 million for 2019. This 32% decrease reflected a $20 million decrease in the gas utilities sector, a $288 million decrease in the downstream and industrial sector, a $394 million decrease in the upstream production sector and a $231 million decrease in the midstream pipeline sector. The decline in gas utilities was primarily due to pandemic restrictions as customers paused or slowed spending during the second quarter. The decline in the upstream production sector is a result of reduced customer spending and lower activity levels, including a 49% reduction in well completions. The decline in the midstream pipeline sector is attributable to lower production levels and reduced demand for infrastructure, as well as the timing of project activity. Downstream and industrial sales declined due to delayed or reduced maintenance spending from lower demand as well as non-recurring turnarounds. All sectors were negatively impacted by the economic slowdown resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which started in March 2020.
Canadian Segment-Our Canadian sales decreased $98 million to $128 million for 2020 from $226 million for 2019. This 43% decrease was across all sectors including a $73 million decrease in the upstream production sector, which was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated reduced demand. In addition, the midstream pipeline sector declined $13 million as a result of non-recurring project work. The weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar unfavorably impacted sales by $1 million, or 1%.
International Segment-Our International sales decreased $71 million to $409 million for 2020 from $480 million for 2019. The 15% decrease is attributable to reduced spending in the upstream production sector followed by the downstream and industrial sector due to lower activity levels associated with reduced demand. Upstream production sales also declined, in part, due to the 2019 completion of a multi-year project in Kazakhstan. In addition, the weakening of foreign currencies in areas where we operate relative to the U.S. dollar unfavorably impacted sales by $5 million, or 1%.
Gross Profit. Our gross profit was $431 million (16.8% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $653 million (17.8% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $222 million decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in sales volumes. As compared to average cost, our last-in first-out (“LIFO”) inventory costing methodology reduced cost of sales by $19 million in 2020 compared to $2 million in 2019. In addition, gross profit for 2020 was negatively impacted by $46 million of inventory-related charges to reduce the carrying value of certain excess and obsolete inventory items to their realizable value compared to $5 million of similar charges in 2019.
Adjusted Gross Profit. Adjusted Gross Profit decreased to $504 million (19.7% of sales) for 2020 from $719 million (19.6% of sales) for 2019, a decrease of $215 million. Adjusted Gross Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted Gross Profit as sales, less cost of sales, plus depreciation and amortization, plus amortization of intangibles, plus inventory-related charges and plus or minus the impact of our LIFO inventory costing methodology. We present Adjusted Gross Profit because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance without regard to items, such as amortization of intangibles that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon the nature and extent of acquisitions. Similarly, the impact of the LIFO inventory costing method can cause results to vary substantially from company to company depending upon whether they elect to utilize LIFO and depending upon which method they may elect. We use Adjusted Gross Profit as a key performance indicator in managing our business. We believe that gross profit is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to Adjusted Gross Profit.

Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses. Costs such as salaries, wages, employee benefits, rent, utilities, communications, insurance, fuel and taxes (other than state and federal income taxes) that are necessary to operate our branch and corporate operations are included in SG&A. Also contained in this category are certain items that are non-operational in nature, including certain costs of acquiring and integrating other businesses. Our SG&A expenses were $449 million (17.5% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $550 million (15.0% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $101 million decrease in SG&A was driven by lower employee-related costs, including incentives and benefits, resulting from the decline in business activity. These lower personnel costs were partially offset by $14 million of expenses associated with facilities closures and $14 million of severance and restructuring charges in 2020 as compared to $9 million of severance and restructuring charges in 2019. 2020 SG&A was reduced by the $2 million recovery of supplier bad debt. 2019 SG&A included a $5 million charge associated with the doubtful collection of a product claim against a foreign supplier. Excluding the impact of these charges, SG&A decreased $113 million. The weakening of foreign currencies in areas where we operate relative to the U.S. dollar favorably impacted SG&A by $3 million.
Operating (Loss) Income. Operating loss was $260 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to operating income of $103 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decline of $363 million.
U.S. Segment-Our U.S. segment had an operating loss of $207 million for 2020 as compared to operating income of $104 million for 2019. The $311 million decrease was impacted by $202 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairments, $28 million of inventory-related charges, $8 million of severance costs, and $3 million of costs associated with facility closures. Excluding these charges, the decline in operating income was driven by lower sales offset by a reduction in SG&A.
Canadian Segment-Our Canadian segment had an operating loss of $6 million for 2020 as compared to $1 million for 2019. The $5 million decline was primarily a result of $2 million of inventory-related charges, $1 million of severance costs, and $1 million of costs associated with facility closures. The impact of the decline in sales was largely offset by reductions in SG&A expenses resulting from cost reduction measures.
International Segment-Our International segment had operating loss of $47 million for 2020 as compared to $0 million in 2019. The $47 million decline in operating income was primarily attributable to certain unusual charges. These included $40 million of goodwill impairment charges, $16 million of inventory-related charges, $5 million of severance and $10 million of cost associated with facility closures. Excluding these charges, operating income would have increased which was primarily attributable to cost reductions that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2019 as well as the $2 million reduction in 2020 SG&A expense resulting from the recovery of a supplier bad debt.
Interest Expense. Our interest expense was $28 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in interest expense was attributable to lower average debt levels and lower interest rates in 2020 as compared to 2019.
Other Income. Our other income was $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other income for 2020 included a $5 million gain from a sale leaseback transaction.
Income Tax (Benefit) Expense. Our income tax benefit was $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to expense of $27 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our effective tax rates were 3% and 41% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our rates generally differ from the U.S. federal statutory rates of 21% as a result of state income taxes and differing foreign income tax rates. The effective tax rate for the 2020 was lower primarily due to a non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge during the second quarter.
Net (Loss) Income. Our net loss was $274 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to net income of $39 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $313 million reflecting a decline in income before taxes for the reasons noted above.
Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $97 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $201 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our Adjusted EBITDA decreased $104 million over that period primarily as a result of the factors noted above.
We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangibles and certain other expenses, including non-cash expenses (such as equity-based compensation, severance and restructuring, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and asset impairments, including inventory) and plus or minus the impact of our LIFO inventory costing methodology.
We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors a helpful measure for comparing our operating performance with the performance of other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. We believe that net income is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA.
The following table reconciles net income, as derived from our consolidated financial statements, with Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure (in millions):
Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018
For discussion and analysis of fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, please refer to Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 14, 2020 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Financial Condition and Cash Flows
Cash Flows
The following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated below (in millions):
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $261 million in 2020 compared to $242 million provided by operating activities in 2019. The change in operating cash flows was primarily the result of lower working capital requirements due to declining sales in 2020 as compared to 2019. A reduction in working capital provided cash of $220 million in 2020 compared to $118 million provided by working capital in 2019. The decline in accounts receivable generated $141 million of cash in 2020 as compared to $127 million in accounts receivable in 2019. In addition, because of the decline in sales, we have reduced inventory resulting in $173 million of cash provided from inventory in 2020 as compared to $95 million in 2019. These reductions in the use of cash were offset by $98 million of cash utilized from a reduction in accounts payable in 2020 as compared to $79 million in 2019.
Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities was $19 million in 2020 compared to $16 million used in 2019. In 2020, we completed sale leaseback transactions involving four of our locations which generated net proceeds of $29 million. Purchases of property, plant and equipment utilized cash of $11 million and $18 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $195 million in 2020, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $238 million in 2019. Net payments on our Global ABL Facility totaled $161 million in 2020 compared to $129 million in 2019. In 2019, we used $75 million to fund purchases of our common stock. We used $24 million to fund dividends on our preferred stock in each of 2020 and 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary credit facilities consist of a Term Loan maturing in September 2024 with an original principal amount of $400 million and an $800 million Global ABL Facility. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance on our Term Loan, net of original issue discount and issuance costs, was $383 million. On an annual basis, we are required to repay an amount equal to 50% of excess cash flow, as defined in the Term Loan agreement, reducing to 25% if the Company’s senior secured leverage ratio is no more than 2.75 to 1.00. No payment of excess cash flow is required if the Company’s senior secured leverage ratio is less than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00. Under the terms of the Term Loan, the amount of cash used in the determination of the senior secured leverage ratio is limited to $75 million. For the current year, as a result of declining profitability and the generation of positive cash flow from working capital contraction, we would be required to make a repayment by April 2021 pursuant to this provision unless we obtain an amendment to the Term Loan. We are exploring the possibility of entering into such an amendment with representatives of our Term Loan lenders. If we make this payment, which we currently estimate will be approximately $105 million, we expect to source it from availability on our Global ABL Facility. As such, the payment would reduce overall liquidity and result in lower interest expense going forward.
The Global ABL Facility matures in September 2022 and provides $675 million in revolver commitments in the United States, $65 million in Canada, $18 million in Norway, $15 million in Australia, $13 million in the Netherlands, $7 million in the United Kingdom and $7 million in Belgium. The Global ABL Facility contains an accordion feature that allows us to increase the principal amount of the facility by up to $200 million, subject to securing additional lender commitments. Availability is dependent on a borrowing base comprised of a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory which is subject to redetermination from time to time. As of December 31, 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding and $432 million of Excess Availability, as defined under our Global ABL Facility.
Our primary sources of liquidity consist of cash generated from our operating activities, existing cash balances and borrowings under our existing Global ABL Facility. At December 31, 2020, our total liquidity, consisting of cash on hand and amounts available under our Global ABL Facility, was $551 million. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from our operating activities is primarily dependent on our sales of products to our customers at profits sufficient to cover our fixed and variable expenses. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $119 million and $32 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $57 million and $32 million of our cash and cash equivalents were maintained in the accounts of our various foreign subsidiaries and, if those amounts were transferred among countries or repatriated to the U.S., those amounts may be subject to additional tax liabilities, which would be recognized in our financial statements in the period during which the transfer decision was made. During 2020, we repatriated $29 million of cash from our Canadian subsidiaries.
Our credit ratings are below “investment grade” and, as such, could impact both our ability to raise new funds as well as the interest rates on our future borrowings. In the second quarter of 2020, Moody’s Investor Services and S&P Global Ratings downgraded our credit ratings, from B1 to B2 and B to B-, respectively, largely due to softening demand for our products due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the reduction in our customer’s spending outlook from unusually low oil and gas prices. Our existing obligations restrict our ability to incur additional debt. We were in compliance with the covenants contained in our various credit facilities as of and during the year ended December 31, 2020. Our credit facilities contain provisions that address the forthcoming need to transition away from LIBOR when it is discontinued or replaced.
We believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy the anticipated cash requirements associated with our existing operations for at least the next twelve months. However, our future cash requirements could be higher than we currently expect as a result of various factors. Additionally, our ability to generate sufficient cash from our operating activities depends on our future performance, which is subject to general economic, political, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. We may, from time to time, seek to raise additional debt or equity financing or re-price or refinance existing debt in the public or private markets, based on market conditions. Any such capital markets activities would be subject to market conditions, reaching final agreement with lenders or investors, and other factors, and there can be no assurance that we would successfully consummate any such transactions.
Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies
Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes our minimum payment obligations as of December 31, 2020 relating to long-term debt, interest payments, capital leases, operating leases, purchase obligations and other long-term liabilities for the periods indicated (in millions):
(1)
Long-term debt is based on debt outstanding at December 31, 2020.
(2)
Interest payments are based on interest rates in effect at December 31, 2020 and assume contractual amortization payments.
(3)
Purchase obligations reflect our commitments to purchase PVF products in the ordinary course of business. While our vendors often allow us to cancel these purchase orders without penalty, in certain cases cancellations may subject us to cancellation fees or penalties, depending on the terms of the contract.
We historically have been an acquisitive company. We expect to fund future acquisitions primarily from (i) borrowings, either the unused portion of our facilities or new debt issuances, (ii) cash provided by operations or (iii) the issuance of additional equity in connection with the acquisitions.
Other Commitments
In the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we are contingently liable for performance under standby letters of credit and bid, performance and surety bonds. We were contingently liable for approximately $20 million of standby letters of credit, trade guarantees that banks issue and bid, and performance and surety bonds at December 31, 2020. Management does not expect any material amounts to be drawn on these instruments.
Legal Proceedings
Asbestos Claims. We are one of many defendants in lawsuits that plaintiffs have brought seeking damages for personal injuries that exposure to asbestos allegedly caused. Plaintiffs and their family members have brought these lawsuits against a large volume of defendant entities as a result of the various defendants’ manufacture, distribution, supply or other involvement with asbestos, asbestos-containing products or equipment or activities that allegedly caused plaintiffs to be exposed to asbestos. These plaintiffs typically assert exposure to asbestos as a consequence of third-party manufactured products that the Company’s subsidiary, MRC Global (US) Inc., purportedly distributed. As of December 31, 2020, we are a named defendant in approximately 578 lawsuits involving approximately 1,153 claims. No asbestos lawsuit has resulted in a judgment against us to date, with the majority being settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved. Applicable third-party insurance has substantially covered these claims, and insurance should continue to cover a substantial majority of existing and anticipated future claims. Accordingly, we have recorded a liability for our estimate of the most likely settlement of asserted claims and a related receivable from insurers for our estimated recovery, to the extent we believe that the amounts of recovery are probable.
We annually conduct analyses of our asbestos-related litigation to estimate the adequacy of the reserve for pending and probable asbestos-related claims. Given these estimated reserves and existing insurance coverage that has been available to cover substantial portions of these claims, we believe that our current accruals and associated estimates relating to pending and probable asbestos-related litigation likely to be asserted over the next 15 years are currently adequate. This belief, however, relies on a number of assumptions, including:
●
That our future settlement payments, disease mix and dismissal rates will be materially consistent with historic experience;
●
That future incidences of asbestos-related diseases in the U.S. will be materially consistent with current public health estimates;
●
That the rates at which future asbestos-related mesothelioma incidences result in compensable claims filings against us will be materially consistent with its historic experience;
●
That insurance recoveries for settlement payments and defense costs will be materially consistent with historic experience;
●
That legal standards (and the interpretation of these standards) applicable to asbestos litigation will not change in material respects;
●
That there are no materially negative developments in the claims pending against us; and
●
That key co-defendants in current and future claims remain solvent.
If any of these assumptions prove to be materially different in light of future developments, liabilities related to asbestos-related litigation may be materially different than amounts accrued or estimated. Further, while we anticipate that additional claims will be filed in the future, we are unable to predict with any certainty the number, timing and magnitude of such future claims. In addition, applicable insurance policies are subject to overall caps on limits, which coverage may exhaust the amount available from insurers under those limits. In those cases, the Company is seeking indemnity payments from responsive excess insurance policies, but other insurers may not be solvent or may not make payments under the policies without contesting their liability. In our opinion, there are no pending legal proceedings that are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Other Legal Claims and Proceedings. From time to time, we have been subject to various claims and involved in legal proceedings incidental to the nature of our businesses. We maintain insurance coverage to reduce financial risk associated with certain of these claims and proceedings. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these claims and proceedings. However, in our opinion, there are no pending legal proceedings that are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. See also “Note 17-Commitments and Contingencies” to the audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any material “off-balance sheet arrangements” as SEC rules and regulations define that term.
Critical Accounting Estimates
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. To apply these principles, management must make judgments and assumptions and develop estimates based on the best available information at the time. Actual results may differ based on the accuracy of the information utilized and subsequent events. The notes to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this report describe our accounting policies. These critical accounting policies could materially affect the amounts recorded in our financial statements. We believe the following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
Inventories: Our U.S. inventories are valued at the lower of cost (principally using the LIFO method) or market. We record an estimate each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation (using period to date inflation rates) and estimated year-end inventory balances. These estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Our inventories that are held outside of the U.S., totaling $145 million and $181 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were valued at the lower of weighted-average cost or estimated net realizable value.
Under the LIFO inventory valuation method, changes in the cost of inventory are recognized in cost of sales in the current period even though these costs may have been incurred at significantly different values. Since the Company values most of its inventory using the LIFO inventory costing methodology, a rise in inventory costs has a negative effect on operating results, while, conversely, a fall in inventory costs results in a benefit to operating results.
We determine reserves for inventory based on historical usage of inventory on-hand, assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Customers rely on the company to stock specialized items for certain projects and other needs. Therefore, the estimated carrying value of inventory depends upon demand driven by oil and gas spending activity, which in turn depends on oil and gas prices, the general outlook for economic growth worldwide, political stability in major oil and gas producing areas, and the potential obsolescence of various inventory items we sell.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets: We record goodwill and intangible assets in conjunction with acquisitions that we make. These assets comprise 28% of our total assets as of December 31, 2020. We record goodwill as the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets that we acquire. We record intangible assets at fair value at the date of acquisition and amortize the value of intangible assets over the assets’ estimated useful lives unless we determine that an asset has an indefinite life. We make significant judgments and estimates in both calculating the fair value of these assets and determining their estimated useful lives. The carrying values of our goodwill and intangible assets, by reporting unit, were as follows as of December 31, 2020 (in millions):
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:
Our long-lived assets consist primarily of:
●
customer base intangibles; and
●
property, plant and equipment.
The carrying value of these assets is subject to an impairment test when circumstances indicate a possible impairment. These circumstances would include significant decreases in our operating results and significant changes in market demand for our products and services. When events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment, we assess recoverability from future operations using an undiscounted cash flow analysis, derived from the lowest appropriate asset group. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, we would recognize an impairment charge to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
We group customer base intangible assets on a basis consistent with our reporting units. We determine the fair value of customer base intangibles using a discounted cash flow analysis. The most significant factor in the determination of the fair value of our customer base intangibles is forecasted sales to our customers including, in particular, our largest customers. Possible indicators of impairment could include the following:
●
prolonged decline in commodity oil and natural gas prices;
●
the resulting decline in activity levels of many of our major customers;
●
significant reductions in capital spending budgets of our customers; and
●
a pessimistic outlook for the price of oil and natural gas.
Although we determined there were no impairments of long-lived assets in 2020 and 2019, significant decreases in our forecasted sales, particularly with our largest customers, could result in future impairments of our customer base intangible assets.
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment as of December 31, 2020 was $103 million, or 6% of total assets. This amount was comprised of $89 million, $2 million and $12 million in our U.S., Canada and International segments, respectively. We group property, plant and equipment and evaluate it for recoverability at a country or regional level. We determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment based on appraisal procedures which involve both market and cost techniques depending on the nature of the specific assets and the availability of market information. In 2020, no indicators of property, plant and equipment impairment were present. Based on the nature of our property, plant and equipment and the reduction in carrying value each year through depreciation, we believe future impairments are not likely.
When testing for the impairment of the value of long-lived assets, we make forecasts of:
●
our future operating results;
●
the extent and timing of future cash flows;
●
working capital;
●
profitability; and
●
sales growth trends.
We make these forecasts using the best available information at the time, including information regarding current market conditions and customer spending forecasts. While we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable, because of the volatile nature of the energy industry, actual results may differ materially from the projected results which could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges. Factors that could lead to actual results differing materially from projected results include, among other things, further reductions of oil and natural gas prices and changes in projected sales growth rates.
Impairment of Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets: We test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. Within each reporting unit, we have elected to aggregate the component countries and regions into a single reporting unit based on their similar economic characteristics, products, customers, suppliers, methods of distribution and the manner in which we operate each segment. We perform our annual tests for goodwill impairment as of October 1st of each year, updating on an interim basis should indications of impairment exist.
When we perform the goodwill impairment test, we compare the carrying value of the reporting unit that has the goodwill with the estimated fair value of that reporting unit. To the extent the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than its estimated fair value, a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the difference, up to the carrying value of goodwill. Our impairment methodology uses discounted cash flow and multiples of cash earnings valuation techniques, acquisition control premium and valuation comparisons to similar businesses to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. Each of these methods involves Level 3 unobservable market inputs and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding:
●
future operating results,
●
the extent and timing of future cash flows,
●
working capital,
●
sales prices,
●
profitability,
●
discount rates; and
●
sales growth trends.
We make these forecasts using the best available information at the time including information regarding current market conditions and customer spending forecasts. While we believe that these assumptions and estimates are reasonable, because of the volatile nature of the energy industry, actual results may differ materially from the projected results which could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges. Factors that could lead to actual results differing materially from projected results include, among other things:
●
reduction of oil and natural gas prices,
●
changes in projected sales growth rate; and
●
changes in factors affecting our discount rate including risk premiums, risk free interest rates and costs of capital.
In the first half of 2020, demand for oil and natural gas declined sharply as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This disruption in demand and the resulting decline in the price of oil had a dramatic negative impact on our business. We experienced a significant reduction in sales beginning in April 2020 which continued throughout the second quarter. At that time, there remained ongoing uncertainty around the timing and extent of any recovery. We took a more pessimistic long-term outlook due to the significant reduction in the demand for oil, the implications of that demand destruction on the price of oil for an extended period of time and actions our customers had taken to curtail costs and reduce spending. As a result of those developments, we concluded that it was more likely than not the fair values of our U.S. and International reporting units were lower than their carrying values. Accordingly, we completed an interim goodwill impairment test as of April 30, 2020. This test resulted in a $217 million goodwill impairment charge comprised of $177 million in our U.S. reporting unit and $40 million in our International reporting unit.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are recorded in our U.S. segment. We test these assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. This test compares the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets with their estimated fair value. If the carrying value is more than the estimated fair value, we recognize impairment losses in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value. Our impairment methodology uses discounted cash flow and estimated royalty rate valuation techniques. Utilizing these valuation methods, we make certain assumptions and estimates regarding:
●
future operating results,
●
sales prices,
●
discount rates; and
●
sales growth trends.
As with the goodwill impairment test described above, while we believe that our assumptions and estimates are reasonable, because of the volatile nature of the energy industry, actual results may differ materially from the projected results which could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges.
As a result of the same factors that necessitated an interim impairment test for goodwill, we completed an interim impairment test, as of April 30, 2020, for our U.S. indefinite-lived tradename asset. This test resulted in an impairment charge of $25 million.
In connection with our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived tradename impairment tests as of October 1, 2020, we performed a qualitative assessment of the carrying value of the goodwill for our U.S. reporting unit and U.S. indefinite-lived tradename asset. This assessment took into consideration changes in the broader economy, our industry and our business since the quantitative impairment tests completed as of April 30, 2020. Based on our assessment, we concluded that it was not more likely than not that the carrying value of the U.S. reporting unit or tradename asset exceeded their fair values. The U.S. tradename is our only indefinite-lived intangible asset.
Income Taxes: We use the liability method for determining our income taxes, under which current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the tax rate expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refunds received. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
In determining the need for valuation allowances and our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider and make judgments regarding all the available positive and negative evidence, including the timing of the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, estimated future taxable income, ongoing, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and recent financial results of operations. The amount of valuation allowances, however, could be adjusted in the future if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present in certain jurisdictions and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.
Our tax provision is based upon our expected taxable income and statutory rates in effect in each country in which we operate. We are subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and foreign tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes we provide during any given year.
A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits. We adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which the new information is available.
