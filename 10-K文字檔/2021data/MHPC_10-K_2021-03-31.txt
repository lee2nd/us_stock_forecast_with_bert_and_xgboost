ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our plans and financial condition. The following selected financial information is derived from our historical financial statements should be read in conjunction with such financial statements and notes thereto set forth elsewhere herein and the “Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements” explanation included in the “Introductory Notes” above.
Overview
We are a self-administered, self-managed, vertically integrated owner and operator of manufactured housing communities. We earn income from leasing manufactured home sites to tenants who own their own manufactured home and the rental of company-owned manufactured homes to residents of the communities.
We own and operate nineteen manufactured housing communities containing approximately 1,249 developed sites and a total of 407 company-owned manufactured homes. The communities are located in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. See Item 2. “Properties” for a description of these manufactured housing communities.
We believe that manufactured housing is accepted by the public as a viable and economically attractive alternative to common stick-built single-family housing. We believe that the affordability of the modern manufactured home makes it a very attractive housing alternative. Manufactured housing is one of the only non-subsidized affordable housing options in the U.S. Demand for housing affordability continues to increase, but supply remains static, as there are virtually no new manufactured housing communities being developed. We are committed to becoming an industry leader in providing this affordable housing option and an improved level of service to our residents, while producing an attractive and stable risk adjusted return to our investors.
Recent Developments
Impact of Coronavirus Pandemic
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. The virus has since spread to over 150 countries and every state in the United States. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency.
Most states and cities, including where our properties are located, have reacted by instituting quarantines, restrictions on travel, “stay at home” rules and restrictions on the types of businesses that may continue to operate, as well as guidance in response to the pandemic and the need to contain it.
We are carefully reviewing all rules, regulations, and orders and responding accordingly. We have taken steps to take care of our employees, including providing the ability for employees to work remotely and implementing strategies to support appropriate social distancing techniques for those employees who are not able to work remotely. We have also taken precautions with regard to employee, facility and office hygiene as well as implementing significant travel restrictions. We are also assessing our business continuity plans for all business units in the context of the pandemic. This is a rapidly evolving situation, and we will continue to monitor and mitigate developments affecting our workforce, our tenants, and the public at large to the extent we are able to do so.
The rules and restrictions put in place have had a negative impact on the economy and business activity and may adversely impact the ability of our tenants, many of whom may be restricted in their ability to work, to pay their rent as and when due. In addition, our property managers may be limited in their ability to properly maintain our properties. Enforcing our rights as landlord against tenants who fail to pay rent or otherwise do not comply with the terms of their leases may not be possible as many jurisdictions, including those where are properties are located, have established rules and/or regulations preventing us from evicting tenants for certain periods in response to the pandemic. If we are unable to enforce our rights as landlords, our business would be materially affected.
If the current pace of the pandemic cannot be slowed and the spread of the virus is not contained, our business operations could be further delayed or interrupted. We expect that government and health authorities may announce new or extend existing restrictions, which could require us to make further adjustments to our operations in order to comply with any such restrictions. The duration of any business disruption cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but may materially affect our ability to operate our business and result in additional costs.
The extent to which the pandemic may impact our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted as of the date of this offering circular, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the pandemic and steps taken to contain the pandemic or treat its impact, among others. Nevertheless, the pandemic and the current financial, economic and capital markets environment present material uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See also “Risk Factors” above.
Additional Closings of Regulation A Offering
Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we sold an aggregate of 74,882 shares of Series B Preferred Stock is additional closings of the Regulation A offering described below for total gross proceeds of $748,820. After deducting a placement fee, we received net proceeds of approximately $696,403. We also issued 2,900 shares of Common Stock to additional early investors.
Results of Operations
The following table sets forth key components of our results of operations during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had total revenues of $6,380,515, as compared to $3,205,925 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $3,174,590, or 99.02%. The increase was primarily due to $558,222 of rental income from the acquisition of two manufactured housing communities during 2020 and a complete year of rental income totaling $1,744,478 related to five properties acquired during 2019. The remaining increase was due to an average 7% increase in occupancy and rental rate increases.
Community Operating Expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had total community operating expenses of $1,633,480, as compared to $1,267,452 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $366,028, or 28.88%. The increase in community operating expenses was primarily due to the five properties acquired throughout 2019. Community operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 25.60% and 39.53% during 2020 and 2019, respectively. Community operating expenses as a percentage of revenues improved as we continued to scale resources as we grow and operate more efficiently.
Corporate Payroll and Overhead Expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had corporate payroll and overhead expenses of $1,581,807, as compared to $1,253,383 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $328,424, or 26.20%. Such increase was primarily due to additional legal and audit fees due to our acquisitions, and additional personnel to support our growth.
Depreciation Expense. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had depreciation expense of $1,652,509, as compared to $805,421 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $847,088, or 105.17%. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of two manufactured housing communities during 2020 and a complete year of depreciation expense related to the eight properties acquired during 2019.
Interest Expense. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had interest expense of $1,961,843, as compared to $1,334,090 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $ 627,753, or 47.05%. The increase was primarily related to the two additional loans related to the two acquisitions of manufactured housing communities during 2020 and a complete year of interest expense related to the eight properties acquired during 2019.
Refinancing Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we refinanced a total of $16,374,007 from our loans payable to $15,245,000 of new notes payable from five of our communities. We used the additional loans payable proceeds from the refinance to retire our related party note payable of $2,608,867 plus accrued interest. As of December 31, 2020, we recognized refinancing cost totaling $464,568.
Other Income. We recognized a gain on the sale of the property of $761,978 which is included in other income on the consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold the Butternut manufactured housing community for a total sale price of $2,100,000. The cost net of accumulated depreciation of the community at the time of the sale was $1,338,022. We wrote off mortgage costs of $109,529 which is included in refinancing costs on the consolidated statement of operations.
Net Loss. The factors described above resulted in a net loss of $151,714 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $2,013,040 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $1,861,326, or 92.46%. These losses were offset by the net income attributable to non-controlling interest - variable interest entity of $451,876 and $25,707 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,988,857, including restricted cash of $339,152. In addition to cash generated through operations, we use a variety of sources to fund our cash needs, including acquisitions and sales of properties. We intend to continue to increase our real estate investments. Our business plan includes acquiring communities that yield in excess of our cost of funds and then investing in physical improvements, including adding rental homes onto otherwise vacant sites. Our ability to continue acquiring communities are dependent on our ability to raise capital. There is no guarantee that any of these additional opportunities will materialize or that we will be able to take advantage of such opportunities. The growth of our real estate portfolio depends on the availability of suitable properties which meet our investment criteria and appropriate financing.
We will require additional funding to finance the growth of our current and expected future operations as well as to achieve our strategic objectives. We believe that our current available cash along with anticipated revenues is sufficient to meet our cash needs for the near future. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or terms acceptable to us, if at all.
Our working capital has been used in operating activities, the repayment of a related party revolving note and proceeds from our Regulation A offering described below. We plan to meet our short-term liquidity requirements for the next twelve months, generally through available cash as well as net cash provided by operating activities and availability under the existing $1.5 million revolving note described below. We also have availability from lenders under loan agreements for capital expenditure needs on acquisitions. We expect these resources to help us meet operating working capital requirements. On December 24, 2020, Gvest Homes I LLC entered into a loan agreement with a lender for a commitment amount of up to $20,000,0000 provided that only up to $8,500,000 is to be used for homes.

During 2020, we also issued 12,500 shares of Common Stock to early investors in this offering with a fair value of $4,030.
Promissory Notes
We have issued promissory notes payable to lenders related to the acquisition of our manufactured housing communities. These promissory notes range from 3.25% to 7.0% with 5 to 30 years principal amortization. Two of the promissory notes had an initial 6 months period on interest only payments. The promissory notes are secured by the real estate assets and $26,124,753 for eleven loans were guaranteed by Raymond M. Gee, our chairman, chief executive officer and owner of the principal stockholder of our company.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we refinanced a total of $16,374,007 from loans payable to $15,245,000 of new notes payable from five of the communities. We used the additional loans payable proceeds from the refinance to retire the related party note payable described below. As of December 31, 2020, we recognized refinancing cost totaling $464,568 and capitalized $640,895 of mortgage costs due to the refinancing.
In addition, on May 1, 2020, we received a $139,300 Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, loan from the United States Small Business Administration under provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act. The PPP loan has a two-year term and bears interest at a rate of 1.0% per annum. Monthly principal and interest payments are deferred for six months after the date of disbursement. The PPP loan may be prepaid at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. The PPP loan contains events of default and other provisions customary for a loan of this type. The PPP provides that the loan may be partially or wholly forgiven if the funds are used for certain qualifying expenses as described in the CARES Act. We used the proceeds from the PPP loan for qualifying expenses and applied for forgiveness of the PPP loan in accordance with the terms of the CARES Act. However, we cannot provide assurance that the loan will be forgiven.
The following are terms of these notes:
Metrolina Promissory Note
On May 8, 2017, we issued a promissory note to Metrolina Loan Holdings, LLC, or Metrolina, in the principal amount of $3,000,000. The note is interest only payment based on 8%, and 10% deferred until maturity to be paid with principal balance. The note originally awarded Metrolina 455,000 shares of Common Stock as consideration, which resulted in making Metrolina a related party due to its significant ownership. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid off the entire balance on the note of $2,754,550 plus interest and amended the agreement to allow for the redeployment of the $3,000,000 available, eliminated the conversion option whereby Metrolina could convert the ratio of total outstanding debt at time of exercise of the option into an amount of newly issued shares of our Common Stock determined by dividing the outstanding indebtedness by $3,000,000 multiplied by 10% with a cap of 864,500 shares. The amendment resulted in issuing an additional 545,000 shares with a fair value of $305,200 for a total of 1,000,000 shares awarded to Metrolina. The note gives Metrolina the right and option to purchase its pro rata share of debt or equity securities issued to maintain up to 10% equity interest in our company at the most recent price of any equity transaction for seven years from the amendment dated February 26, 2019. This note was to mature in May of 2023. In September 2020, we paid off the full balance and terminated the note. This related party note was guaranteed by Mr. Gee. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the balance on this note was $-0- and $1,730,000, respectively.
Note Payable - Related Party
On October 1, 2017, we issued a revolving promissory note to Mr. Gee, pursuant to which we may borrow up to $1,500,000 from Mr. Gee on a revolving basis for working capital purposes. This note has a five-year term with no annual interest and principal payment is deferred until the maturity date. In September 2020, we paid off the full balance. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the outstanding balance on this note was $0 and $878,867, respectively.
Line of Credit - Occupied Home Facility
On December 24, 2020, Gvest Homes I LLC entered into a loan agreement with a lender for a commitment amount of up to $20,000,0000 provided that only up to $8,500,000 is to be used for homes. The agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios and other affirmative and negative covenants. As of December 31, 2020, our company was not in compliance with a certain financial covenant. We obtained a waiver from the lender for the covenant in March 2021.
For the year ended December 31, 2020 the lender agreed to advance $3,348,967 to our company, of which $2,218,630 was due from the lender as of the balance sheet date. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we collected $770,463 of the outstanding balance owed to us from the lender. As of December 31, 2020 there was $5,151,033 available on the line of credit for the purchase of homes.
The advances bear interest at 8.375% and maturity date of the loan is January 1, 2030. Pursuant to the agreement, we are obligated to pay a fee to the lender equal to 1% of the amount of each advance which funding fee shall be deducted from he then available commitment amount. The advances are guaranteed by Raymond M. Gee, our chairman, chief executive officer and owner of the principal stockholder of our company.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Critical Accounting Policies
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Critical accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgment and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policies are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition.
Mobile home sale revenues are recognized in accordance with Topic 606 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, for revenue recognition. We recognize revenue in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. We consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when all the five following criteria are met: (1) identification of the contract with a customer, (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation.
Under ASC 842, we must assess on an individual lease basis whether it is probable that we will collect the future lease payments. We consider the tenant’s payment history and current credit status when assessing collectability. When collectability is not deemed probable, we write-off the tenant’s receivables, including straight-line rent receivable, and limit lease income to cash received.
Our revenues primarily consist of rental revenues and fee and other income. We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:
● Rental revenues include revenues from the leasing land lot or a combination of both, the mobile home and land at our properties to tenants.
○ Revenues from the leasing of land lot or a combination of both, the mobile home and land at our properties to tenants include (i) lease components, including land lot or a combination of both, the mobile home and land, and (ii) reimbursement of utilities and account for the components as a single lease component in accordance with ASC 842.
○ Revenues derived from fixed lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable period of the lease. We commence rental revenue recognition when the underlying asset is available for use by the lessee. Revenue derived from the reimbursement of utilities are generally recognized in the same period as the related expenses are incurred. Our leases are month-to-month.
● Fee and other income include late fees, violation fees and other revenue arising from contractual agreements with third parties. This revenue is recognized as the services are transferred in accordance with ASC 606.
Acquisitions. We account for acquisitions as asset acquisitions in accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations,” and allocate the purchase price of the property based upon the fair value of the assets acquired, which generally consist of land, site and land improvements, buildings and improvements and rental homes. We allocate the purchase price of an acquired property generally determined by internal evaluation as well as third-party appraisal of the property obtained in conjunction with the purchase.
Variable Interest Entities. In December 2020, we sold 305 park owned homes in four communities to Gvest Finance LLC, a company owned and controlled by our parent company, Gvest Real Estate Capital LLC, an entity whose sole owner is Raymond M. Gee, our chairman and chief executive officer, and to its wholly owned subsidiary Gvest Homes 1 LLC, for a total of $4,648,967. We also executed a management agreement with these entities to manage the homes while remitting to our company all income, less any sums paid out for debt service plus 5% of the debt service payment. Primarily due to our common ownership by Mr. Gee, our power to direct the activities of these entities that most significantly impact their economic performance, and the fact that our company has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from these entities that could potentially be significant to these entities, Gvest Finance LLC and Gvest Homes 1 LLC are considered to be VIEs in accordance with applicable GAAP. A company with interests in a VIE must consolidate the entity if the company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE; that is, if it has both (1) the power to direct the economically significant activities of the entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Such a determination requires management to evaluate circumstances and relationships that may be difficult to understand and to make a significant judgment, and to repeat the evaluation at each subsequent reporting date. In accordance with applicable GAAP, because of the common ownership among the entities, the consolidation of the VIEs have been accounted for retrospectively as of the beginning of the first period presented in the consolidated financial statements.
Investment Property and Depreciation. Investment property which consists of property and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation for Sites and Building is computed principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (ranging from 15 to 25 years). Depreciation of Improvements to Sites and Buildings, Rental Homes and Equipment and Vehicles is computed principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (ranging from 3 to 25 years). Land Development Costs are not depreciated until they are put in use, at which time they are capitalized as Sites and Land Improvements. Interest Expense pertaining to Land Development Costs are capitalized. Maintenance and Repairs are charged to expense as incurred and improvements are capitalized. The costs and related accumulated depreciation of property sold or otherwise disposed of are removed from the financial statement and any gain or loss is reflected in the current period’s results of operations.
Impairment Policy. We apply ASC 360-10, “Property, Plant & Equipment,” to measure impairment in real estate investments. Rental properties are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future cash flows (on an undiscounted basis without interest) from a rental property is less than the carrying value under its historical net cost basis. These expected future cash flows consider factors such as future operating income, trends and prospects as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. Upon determination that a permanent impairment has occurred, rental properties are reduced to their fair value. For properties to be disposed of, an impairment loss is recognized when the fair value of the property, less the estimated cost to sell, is less than the carrying amount of the property measured at the time there is a commitment to sell the property and/or it is actively being marketed for sale. A property to be disposed of is reported at the lower of its carrying amount or its estimated fair value, less its cost to sell. Subsequent to the date that a property is held for disposition, depreciation expense is not recorded. There was no impairment during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Stock Based Compensation. All stock based payments to employees, nonemployee consultants, and to nonemployee directors for their services as directors, including any grants of restricted stock and stock options, are measured at fair value on the grant date and recognized in the statements of operations as compensation or other expense over the relevant service period in accordance with ASC Topic 718. Stock based payments to nonemployees are recognized as an expense over the period of performance. Such payments are measured at fair value at the earlier of the date a performance commitment is reached or the date performance is completed. In addition, for awards that vest immediately and are nonforfeitable the measurement date is the date the award is issued. We recorded stock option expense of $2,370 and $4,774 during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments. We follow paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB ASC for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB ASC to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.
