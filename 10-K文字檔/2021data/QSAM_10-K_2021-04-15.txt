ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
A. Plan of Operation
Legacy Business
Until November 2020, our primary business was acquiring and overseeing the acquisition of companies in the compost and soil health sector (the “Legacy Business”). Through an affiliated company, Earth Property Holdings LLC (“EPH”), we completed two acquisitions of compost facilities in Austin, Texas and Jacksonville, Florida, and had been managing all the operations of those entities through an eight-year Management Agreement providing us $700,000 per year in fees. Prior to these operations, we were developing waste-to-power technology with the goal of pursuing business opportunities in the clean energy sector. In 2017 we raised funding through our Bridge Offering (see “Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources” below) to transition into the soil health sector, and sold our prior waste-to-power technology to a licensee.
EPH is an unconsolidated investee entity in which we owned approximately an 18% Class B subordinated equity stake as of December 31, 2020. Class A equity holders comprised of one primary institutional investor and two follow-on investors who have collectively provided approximately $7 million to EPH, own the other 82% of EPH. As of March 23, 2021, we sold our Class B equity stake in EPH to an unaffiliated party for $100,000, and currently hold no equity in and have no affiliation with EPH.
New Strategic Plan
In January 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a strategic plan comprised of: (1) securing new technologies and business opportunities in the broader biosciences sector, including both human and soil health; and (2) significantly reducing debt and liabilities of the Company (including over $4 million in the Company’s convertible bridge notes (the “Bridge Notes”) which were in default in 2020) and eliminating under-performing assets and agreements. The successful results of these actions were intended to attract new capital to fund long term growth opportunities for the Company, reduce the significant debt burden of the Company, and provide shareholders with new opportunities for growth and value appreciation. We believe we were successful in these efforts.
In January 2020, we appointed Douglas R. Baum to our Board of Directors. Mr. Baum has over 28 years of experience in the bioscience and biotech industries, including development, commercialization and marketing of multiple drugs and medical devices. After his appointment to the Board, Mr. Baum secured for the Company an Exclusive Dealing Option Agreement to provide us a 90-day period to negotiate with IGL Pharma Inc. (“IGL”) for a license to the radiopharmaceutical Samarium-153 DOTMP aka CycloSam® (“CycloSam” or the “New Technology”). CycloSam is a promising drug with initial indications for pediatric osteosarcoma, a devastating form of bone cancer afflicting children, as well as a broader market in bone marrow ablation and other metastasized bone cancers. IGL is an affiliated entity of IsoTherapeutics Group LLC, whose founders created Quadramet® (Samarium-153-EDTMP) one of the first effective commercial radiopharmaceuticals. After signing the option agreement for the licensing of CycloSam, we provided IGL with $50,000 of advanced support fees to fund a single patient test for the drug, which was approved by the FDA to treat a patient in a bone marrow ablation procedure and was performed with technical success.
On April 20, 2020, we exercised our option and executed a Patent and Technology License Agreement and Trademark Assignment (the “License Agreement”) with IGL, through a newly created, wholly-owned subsidiary called QSAM Therapeutics Inc. (“QSAM”). The License Agreement provides our subsidiary QSAM with exclusive, worldwide and sub-licensable rights to all of IGL’s patents, product data and knowhow with respect to CycloSam. The License Agreement also transfers to QSAM the rights to the product name CycloSam for the technology, and provides QSAM a first right of refusal to license other IGL/ISO technologies in the future.
The License Agreement is for 20 years or until the expiration of the multiple patents covered under the license, and requires multiple milestone-based payments including: $60,000 and other expense reimbursements within 60 days of signing (such expenses have been paid), up to $150,000 as CycloSam advances through multiple stages of clinical trials, and $1.5 million upon commercialization. IGL will also receive equity in QSAM equal to 5% of the company to be issued within 60 days of signing. This equity has not yet been issued. Upon commercialization, IGL will receive an on-going royalty equal to 4.5% of Net Sales, as defined in the License Agreement, and up to 50% of any sublicense consideration received by QSAM, as defined in the License Agreement. QSAM will also pay for ongoing patent filing and maintenance fees, and has certain requirements to defend the patents against infringement claims. The parties have agreed to mutual indemnification.
Either party may terminate the License Agreement 30 days after notice in the event of an uncured breach, or immediately in the case of bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. QSAM may terminate for any reason upon 30 days’ notice. In the case IGL terminates due to an uncured QSAM breach, IGL will repay to QSAM 25% of its direct clinical costs to assume ownership of data and other information gained in that process.
In connection with the License Agreement, QSAM signed a two-year Consulting and Confidentiality Agreement (the “Consulting Agreement”) with IGL, which provides IGL with payments of $8,500 per month starting 60 days after signing. The Consulting Agreement is to provide QSAM with additional consulting and advisory services from the technology’s founders to assist in the clinical development of CycloSam.
Separation from EPH and New Business Path
Our Board of Directors determined in the fourth quarter of 2020 that the opportunities presented through the development of the New Technology present shareholders with the best path forward. As a result, on November 6, 2020, we entered into an Omnibus Separation Agreement (the “Separation Agreement”) with EPH. Under the terms of the Separation Agreement, the parties agreed that we will continue to operate and pursue opportunities in the biosciences and pharmaceutical fields while EPH will continue to operate in the compost and soil manufacturing fields. More specifically:
● The Management Agreement, dated January 18, 2019, as amended, between EPH and the Company was terminated by mutual agreement of the parties. Fees from this agreement constituted most of the Company’s revenue over the prior two years. We have presented revenue and expenses related to the Management Agreement, as well as other expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Legacy Business, as “discontinued operations” in our consolidated financial statements.
● In lieu of any severance or other termination payments due under the Management Agreement, EPH released the Company from a total of $993,985 in liabilities, inclusive of advanced management fees and multiple promissory notes, including accrued and unpaid interest. An additional $114,700 in promissory notes plus accrued interest owed to an affiliate of EPH were converted into Company common stock at a price of $0.22 per share.
● The Company agreed to transfer to EPH the license agreement with Agrarian Technologies LLC and Mulch Masters Inc. for the ABS soil enhancement product and all associated knowhow, trade secrets and trademark/service marks. Accrued license fees in connection with that license agreement were also transferred to and assumed by EPH.
● The prior officers and employees of the Company engaged in the Legacy Business were released from any non-competition, non-solicitation or other restricted covenant pursuant to their respective employment agreements. Several of these employees had already been removed from the Company’s payroll as of October 1, 2020.
● EPH received the right in its sole discretion to use the name “Q2Earth” in all jurisdictions of the United States and worldwide.
New Equity Financing and Debt Conversions
To advance the development of the New Technology, in November 2020 we commenced a $2.5 million Series B Preferred stock offering (the “Series B Offering”), issuing 281 shares of Series B Preferred stock for $125,000 ($25,000 of which was recorded as a subscription receivable at the end of 2020) and $156,000 in debt conversion. In January 2021, we completed the Series B Offering, raising $2.5 million (inclusive of the debt conversion) and issuing a total of 2,500 shares of Series B Preferred Stock.
In connection with this Series B Offering closing, our Board approved a modification to the offering terms and we issued in 2021 a total of 6.27 million common stock warrants, which are exercisable prior to July 8, 2021 at an exercise price of $0.35 per share. Also in 2021, our lead investor in the Series B Offering earned a warrant for 475,000 shares which expire January 15, 2022 and are exercisable at $0.45 per share. None of these warrants provide a cashless exercise option nor any registration rights, and none of these warrants were issued or approved in 2020.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, we also further advanced the conversion of Bridge Notes and other liabilities into equity. As of December 31, 2020, a total of $1,965,030 plus $964,525 in accrued interest on the Bridge Notes were converted into approximately 13.3 million shares of common stock. Officers, directors and related parties of the Company converted $346,867 in accrued compensation, unpaid bonuses and other notes payable into 1,576,668 shares of common stock. This is in addition to the $993,985 in liabilities owed to EPH that were forgiven and additional $117,659 note principal and accrued interest converted into 534,814 shares of common stock.
As of the first quarter of 2021, all remaining Bridge Note holders converted their notes, representing $1,447,312 in principal and accrued interest, into 6,578,702 shares of common stock. Also in December 2020 and January 2021, one of the Company convertible debenture holders converted the remaining balance of $27,500 and $72,500 of its debenture into 125,000 and 329,545 shares of common stock, respectively; and in February 2021, converted $120,000 of its Series A Preferred stock into 750,000 shares of common stock. In February 2021, a second debenture holder converted $30,000 of its debenture into 187,541 shares of common stock.
As of the end of the first quarter of 2021, the Company had approximately $2 million in cash and only approximately $35,000 in debt, not including trade payables and the Series A Preferred stock which is still outstanding and subject to a redemption clause in default. Management is in discussions with the Series Preferred A stockholders to convert the remaining balance of these securities into common stock or otherwise amend the redemption terms of their securities.
We believe our transition plan, including the execution of the Separation Agreement and the subsequent debt reduction and equity raise, has significantly strengthened our balance sheet and provided us the funding to pursue the New Technology. Management believes these results have materially improved the chance for shareholder value appreciation in the following periods.
B. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. We are monitoring this closely, and although operations have not been materially affected by the COVID-19 outbreak to date, the ultimate duration and severity of the outbreak and its impact on the economic environment and our business is uncertain. Accordingly, while we do not anticipate an impact on our operations, we cannot estimate the duration of the pandemic and potential impact on our business. In addition, a severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business, including a possible delay in our ability to raise money. At this time, the Company is unable to estimate the impact of this event on its operations.
Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded no revenue from continuing operations. Revenue from the Management Agreement and other Legacy Business operations have been reclassified in our Statement of Operations on our Consolidated Financial Statements as “discontinued operations.”
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a net loss from continuing operations of $4,898,123, an increase of $4,180,144 (582%) from our net loss from continuing operations of $717,979 for the same period in 2019. Basic and diluted net loss per share was $0.88 and $0.34 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The primary reasons for the increase in the net loss for 2020 over 2019 were an increase of $194,702 in operating expenses, as well as an increase in the loss recognized due to the change in the fair value of the convertible bridge notes of $4,228,113 and the loss of $834,903 on convertible debt and other liabilities converted to equity; offset slightly by a decrease of $50,475 in financing costs. Expenses from the Legacy Business operations have been reclassified in our Statement of Operations on our Consolidated Financial Statements as “discontinued operations.”
The majority of the $194,702 increase in operating expenses was due to the research and development expenses of $362,456 and higher general and administrative expenses of $103,955 (246%); offset by lower payroll and related expenses of $277,222 (43%) to $372,938 in the year ended December 31, 2020 from $650,160 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
For year ended December 31, 2020, cash increased by $7,826 from $478 as of December 31, 2019 to $8,304 at the end of 2020. This increase was primarily the result of cash provided by financing activities of $750,725, offset by cash used in operating activities of $742,899.
Net cash used by operating activities was $742,899 for the year ended December 31, 2020, which reflected our net loss during the period of $4,862,683, non-cash adjustments of $3,741,254, and a net increase in operating liabilities of $378,530. The majority of non-cash adjustments consists of a $3,170,236 loss on change in fair value of the Bridge Notes primarily as a result of our higher stock price and proximity to maturity, $484,031 in paid-in-kind interest related to the Bridge Notes, the loss on conversion into common stock of the Bridge Notes and accrued interest of $495,320, the loss on conversion of accrued salary and bonus, director fees and promissory notes with related parties of $271,210 and $258,667 of stock based compensation; offset by the gain on forgiveness of promissory notes and accrued expenses.
Our net loss resulted largely from the non-cash items of the change in fair value of the Bridge Notes and loss on convertible debt and other liabilities that were converted to equity.
Net cash used in investing activities during year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of $0.
Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of additional notes from EPH of $788,500 and additional convertible Bridge Note of $30,000.
At December 31, 2020, our cash totaled $8,304. Our cash is currently held at large U.S. banks.
Based on our current strategy and operating plan, at the end of 2020 we needed to raise additional capital to support operations. This was accomplished in the first quarter of 2021; however, at the end of 2020 there was still substantial doubt about our ability to operate as a going concern. See “Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Going Concern” in our consolidated financial statements.
Series B Financing. In January 2021, the Company closed a Series B Convertible Preferred Stock private placement (the “Series B Offering”) and issued a total of 2,500 shares at a price of $1,000 per share, raising an aggregate amount of $2.5 million, inclusive of $156,000 in debt conversion. The Series B Offering, which commenced in 2020, was led by Checkmate Capital Group, LLC, a California based investment firm focused on biotechnology and other technology investments. The Company completed the offering primarily to advance its new business of drug development including funding the Company’s upcoming clinical trials for its flagship drug candidate CycloSam, as well as for general working capital and overhead.
The shares of Series B Preferred Stock are convertible into an aggregate of approximately 16.6 million shares of common stock of the Company and have voting rights alongside common stockholders on an as-converted basis. In 2021, our Board approved a modification to the offering and issued to investors six-month, non-registered warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 6.27 million shares of Common Stock at $0.35 per share. For the performance of its lead investor commitment in 2021, Checkmate Capital also earned a 12 month warrant convertible into 475,000 shares of Common Stock at $0.45 per share. All warrants were approved and issued in 2021 at the closing of the offering, and therefore were not outstanding at the end of 2020.
Funds received from the Series B Offering are expected to support operations through the end of 2021. Furthermore, if Series B warrants are exercised, the Company expects to have the capital needed to fund both operations and the start of clinical trials of CycloSam at least into the beginning of 2022.
Bridge Note Financing. The Company issued a total of $2,851,908 in Convertible Promissory Notes (the “Bridge Notes”) during 2017, 2018 and 2019. Proceeds from the Bridge Notes were used to for the Company’s legacy business. As of December 31, 2020, a total of $1,965,030 plus $964,525 in accrued interest on the Bridge Notes were converted into approximately 13.3 million shares of common stock. As of March 31, 2021, the remaining $1,447,312 of principal and interest was converted into 6,578,702 shares of common stock, and no Bridge Notes currently remain outstanding.
Additional Debt Settlement. As of December 31, 2020, officers, directors and related parties of the Company converted $346,867 in accrued compensation, unpaid bonuses and other notes payable into 1,576,668 shares of common stock. This is in addition to the $993,985 in liabilities owed to EPH that were forgiven pursuant to the Separation Agreement, and additional $117,659 note principal and accrued interest converted into 534,814 shares of common stock.
Company’s Prior Series A Preferred Stock Financing.
We raised $600,000 in our Series A 6% Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”) from two separate accredited investors in November 2015 and January 2016, respectively. The Preferred Stock bears a 6% dividend per annum, calculable and payable per quarter in cash or additional shares of common stock as determined in the Certificate of Designation. The Preferred Stock was originally convertible at $6.50 per share at the discretion of the holders and contains price protection provisions in the instance that we issue shares at a lower price, subject to certain exemptions. The price has been reset several times since the issuance of the Preferred Stock. Most currently, as a result of the recent debt conversions, the conversation price for these Preferred Shares automatically reduced to $0.22 per share, and as a result of the closing of the Series B preferred stock offering in January 2021, the conversion price was reset to $0.16 per share. Preferred Stock holders also received other rights and protections including piggy-back registration rights, rights of first refusal to invest in subsequent offerings, security over our assets (secondary to our debt holders), and certain negative covenant guaranties that we will not incur non-ordinary debt, enter into variable pricing security sales, redeem or repurchase stock or make distributions, and other similar warranties. The Preferred Stock was redeemable on July 1, 2019 per a March 2019 modification and is currently in technical default. The Preferred Stock has no voting rights until converted to common stock. The Preferred Stockholders also received warrants in connection with their investment, all of which had expired in January 2021.
All promissory notes and shares in these offerings were sold pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Exchange Commission under Regulation D to accredited or sophisticated investors who completed questionnaires confirming their status. Unless otherwise described in this Quarterly Report, reference to “restricted” common stock means that the shares have not been registered and are restricted from resale pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Cash and Working Capital
We have incurred negative cash flows from operations since inception. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $15,911,895 and working capital deficit of $4,168,618.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Disclosures regarding our Critical Accounting Policies are provided in Note 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company did not engage in any “off-balance sheet arrangements” (as that term is defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) as of December 31, 2020.
