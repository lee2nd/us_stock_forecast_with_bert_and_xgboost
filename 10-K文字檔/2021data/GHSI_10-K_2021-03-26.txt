Presentation of Information
As used in this Annual Report, the terms “we,” “us” “our” and the “Company” mean Guardion Health Sciences, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context requires otherwise. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited (and unaudited) financial statements and the related notes thereto. All dollar amounts in this Annual Report refer to U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
Overview
Guardion Health Sciences, Inc. (the “Company” or “we”) was formed in December 2009 in California as a limited liability company under the name P4L Health Sciences, LLC, and it subsequently changed its name to Guardion Health Sciences, LLC.

The Company is a specialty health sciences company (1) that has developed medical foods and medical devices in the ocular health space and (2) that is developing nutraceuticals that the Company believes will provide supportive health benefits to consumers.
We see opportunities to grow our business and create value by developing and distributing condition-specific, clinically proven nutrition, medical foods, and diagnostic devices. Our portfolio of science-based, clinically supported products support healthcare professionals, their patients, and consumers in achieving health goals.
Recent Trends - Market Conditions
The COVID-19 pandemic has and will continue affecting economies and businesses around the world. The impacts of the pandemic could be material, but due to the evolving nature of this situation, we are not able at this time to estimate the impact on our financial or operational results. Among the factors that could impact our results are: effectiveness of COVID-19 mitigation measures; global economic conditions; consumer spending; work from home trends; supply chain sustainability; and other factors. These factors could result in increased or decreased demand for our products and services and impact our ability to serve customers.
Recent Developments
January and February 2021 At the Market Offerings
On January 8, 2021, we entered into the Sales Agreement and filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to which we could sell up to $10,000,000 worth of shares of our common stock in an “at the market” offering through the Distribution Agent (the “January 2021 1st ATM Offering”). On January 15, 2021, we completed the January 2021 1st ATM Offering, pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 2,559,834 shares of our common stock, raised gross proceeds of approximately $10,000,000 and net proceeds of approximately $9,500,000.
On January 28, 2021, we entered into the Sales Agreement and filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to which we could sell up to $25,000,000 worth of shares of our common stock in an “at the market” offering through the Distribution Agent (the “January 2021 2nd ATM Offering”). On February 10, 2021, we completed the January 2021 2nd ATM Offering, pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 5,006,900 shares of our common stock, raised gross proceeds of approximately $25,000,000 and net proceeds of approximately $24,100,000.
In addition, in January 2021 and February 2021, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,647,691 shares of common stock upon the exercise of warrants and received $3,608,509.
Initial Public Offering and 2019 Follow-On Public Offerings
On April 9, 2019, the Company closed its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 208,334 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at an IPO price to the public of $24.00 per share resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $3,888,000 after all costs and expenses. The shares began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market on April 5, 2019 under the symbol “GHSI.”
On August 15, 2019, the Company completed a second public offering (the “August Offering”) of (i) 2,000,000 shares of common stock, (ii) pre-funded warrants exercisable for 166,667 shares of common stock (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”), and (iii) warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,166,667 shares of common stock (the “August Warrants”). The August Offering was conducted pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, dated August 13, 2019 by and between the Company and Maxim Group LLC and WallachBeth Capital, LLC. On August 16, 2019, the Company sold an additional 325,000 August Warrants upon exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. The net proceeds to the Company from the August Offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated expenses were $4,944,340.
The public offering price was $2.64 per share of common stock and $0.01 per accompanying August Warrant. Each August Warrant represents the right to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $3.51 per share. The August Warrants are exercisable immediately, expire five years from the date of issuance and provide that, beginning on the earlier of (i) September 11, 2019 and (ii) the date on which the common stock traded an aggregate of more than 6,666,667 shares after the announcement of the pricing of the August Offering, and ending on the twelve (12) month anniversary thereof, each August Warrant may be exercised at the option of the holder on a cashless basis at a ratio of one August Warrant for one share of common stock, in whole or in part, if the weighted average price of the Common Stock on the trading day immediately prior to the exercise date fails to exceed the initial exercise price of the August Warrant
On October 30, 2019, the Company completed a third public offering of 4,083,334 shares of its common stock (including 283,334 pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock in lieu thereof) and Series B warrants to purchase up to 4,083,334 shares of the Company’s common stock. Each share of common stock (or pre-funded warrant) was sold together with one Series B warrant to purchase one share of common stock at a combined price to the public of $2.052 per share and Series B warrant. The shares of common stock or pre-funded warrants and the accompanying Series B warrants were sold together but will be issued separately and will be immediately separable upon issuance. Net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, were approximately $7.4 million.
The Series B warrants are exercisable at a price of $2.05 per share of common stock and will expire five years from the date on which the Series B warrants become initially exercisable.
Warrant Exercises
From January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, the Company received total gross proceeds of $5,451,892 from the exercise of 2,656,868 warrants issued in the Company’s October 2019 follow-on offering.
NutriGuard Acquisition
Effective September 20, 2019 (the “Effective Date”), the Company’s newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary, NutriGuard Formulations, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Buyer”), entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with NutriGuard Research, Inc., a California corporation (“NutriGuard”), and NutriGuard’s sole shareholder, Mark McCarty (the “NutriGuard Acquisition”).
Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, Buyer purchased from NutriGuard specified assets of the NutriGuard brand and business, primarily consisting of inventory, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property. In exchange, Buyer agreed to pay a royalty fee to NutriGuard subsequent to meeting certain financial performance metrics based on the operating results of the NutriGuard brand of products following the Effective Date. NutriGuard and Mr. McCarty also agreed, among other terms, to no longer use the “NutriGuard” name upon the Effective Date.
Nutraceutical Sales to Malaysian Customer
In February 2020, the Company contracted with a Malaysian company to develop an immune-supportive formula for its consumer base. An initial order was placed, and the Company completed shipment of the product, received payment in full, and recognized revenue for this order of $890,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 1 to the financial statements regarding recent accounting pronouncements.
Concentration of Risk
Cash balances are maintained at large, well-established financial institutions. At times, cash balances may exceed federally insured limits. Insurance coverage limits are $250,000 per depositor at each financial institution. The Company has never experienced any losses related to these balances.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The preparation of its financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company’s financial statements included herein include all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
The following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Revenue is recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those products or services. The Company reviews its sales transactions to identify contractual rights, performance obligations, and transaction prices, including the allocation of prices to separate performance obligations, if applicable.
All products sold by the Company are distinct individual products and are offered for sale as finished goods only, and there are no performance obligations required post-shipment for customers to derive the expected value from them. Contracts with customers contain no incentives or discounts that could cause revenue to be allocated or adjusted over time.
Shipping and handling activities are performed before the customer obtains control of the goods and therefore represent a fulfillment activity rather than a promised service to the customer. Payments for sales of medical foods and dietary supplements are generally made by approved credit cards. Payments for medical device sales are generally made by check, credit card, or wire transfer. Historically the Company has not experienced any significant payment delays from customers.
The Company provides a 30-day right of return to its retail customers. A right of return does not represent a separate performance obligation, but because customers are allowed to return products, the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled is variable. Upon evaluation of historical product returns, the Company determined that less than one percent of products is returned, and therefore believes it is probable that such returns will not cause a significant reversal of revenue in the future. Due to the insignificant amount of historical returns as well as the standalone nature of the Company’s products and assessment of performance obligations and transaction pricing for the Company’s sales contracts, the Company does not currently maintain a contract asset or liability balance at this time. The Company assesses its contracts and the reasonableness of its conclusions on a quarterly basis.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) basis. The Company records adjustments to its inventory for estimated obsolescence or diminution in net realizable value equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. The difference is recognized as a loss in the period in which it occurs. Once inventory has been written down, it creates a new cost basis for inventory that is not subsequently written up.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company periodically issues stock-based compensation to officers, directors, contractors and consultants for services rendered. Such issuances vest and expire according to terms established at the issuance date.
Stock-based payments to officers, directors, consultants, contractors, and employees, which include grants of employee stock options, are recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. Stock option grants, which are generally time or performance vested, are measured at the grant date fair value and charged to operations on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The fair value of stock options is determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which is affected by several variables, including the risk-free interest rate, the expected dividend yield, the expected life of the equity award, the exercise price of the stock option as compared to the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date and the estimated volatility of the common stock over the term of the equity award.
Plan of Operations

Results of Operations
Through December 31, 2020, the Company has primarily been engaged in product development, commercialization, building infrastructure and raising capital. The Company has incurred and will continue to incur significant expenditures for the development of its products and intellectual property, which includes medical foods and medical devices for the treatment of various eye diseases and nutraceuticals. The Company had limited revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Revenue
For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue from product sales was $1,889,844 compared to $902,937 for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting in an increase of $986,907 or 109%. The increase is due primarily to a sale to a Malaysian company of $890,000 for an immune-supportive formula that was delivered by the Company in June 2020.
Cost of Goods Sold
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cost of goods sold was $1,946,635 compared to $341,315 for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting in an increase of $1,605,320 or 470%. One part of the increase in 2020 reflects the costs of goods sold associated with the Malaysian order noted above. In addition, as a result of the deterioration of the forecasted marketability of certain of the Company’s inventory, management recorded a write-down of inventory of $971,719 in cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2020. Without the impact of the inventory write-down in the year ended December 31, 2020, cost of goods sold increased $633,601 or 186%.
Gross Profit (Loss)
For the year ended December 31, 2020, gross loss was $(56,791) compared to gross profit of $561,622 for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting in a decrease of $618,413 or 110%. Gross profit (loss) represented (3)% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, versus 62% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. The lower gross profit in 2020 is primarily as a result of lower distributor pricing given to the Malaysian customer and the write-down of certain inventory that increased cost of goods sold by $971,719.
Research and Development
For the year ended December 31, 2020, research and development costs were $160,978 compared to $194,311 for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting in a decrease of $33,333 or 17%. Research and development costs in our current yearly-period consist primarily of clinical studies related to our medical foods and nutraceuticals versus engineering efforts related to our medical devices in our prior period.
Sales and Marketing
For the year ended December 31, 2020, sales and marketing expenses were $1,450,205 compared to $1,874,901 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses of $424,696 or 23% compared to the prior period was primarily due to a decrease of trade show activity as a result of COVID-19 “stay at home” measures.
General and Administrative
For the year ended December 31, 2020, general and administrative expenses were $7,450,245 compared to $7,425,827 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $24,418 or 0% compared to the prior period was primarily due to an increase in consulting costs, professional fees, and corporate insurance costs, largely offset by a $1,266,000 decrease in stock compensation expense primarily related to the reversal of compensation from prior periods related to forfeited unvested options of a former officer.
Goodwill Impairment
Management concluded that as of December 31, 2019, the fair value of the goodwill associated with the VectorVision acquisition was less than its carrying amount. For the year ended December 31, 32019, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1,563,520. There was no goodwill impairment recorded in 2020.
Costs Related to Resignation of Former Officer
Effective June 15, 2020, Michael Favish resigned as Chief Executive Officer and as an employee of the Company and resigned from the Company’s Board of Directors. Terms of the settlement agreement included the continuation of his previous annual salary of $325,000 during the following twelve months. The full amount of stock compensation costs were recorded in costs related to resignation of former officer.
Mr. Favish’s unvested options at the time of his separation were forfeited. All compensation from prior periods related to these unvested options was reversed, resulting in an adjustment to stock compensation expense during the year ended December 31, 2020 of $(965,295) that was recorded in costs related to resignation of former officer.
In connection with Mr. Favish’s separation, the expiration date of his vested stock options was extended for twelve months from June 15, 2020. In accounting for the modification, the Company calculated the fair value of the vested options immediately before modification and immediately following the modification and recorded incremental stock compensation charge of $24,359 in costs related to resignation of former officer.
Impairment Loss on Equipment Held for Sale
During June 2020, in an effort to reduce costs and focus on other segments of the business, the Company decided to wind down the Transcranial Doppler Solutions, Inc. (“TDSI”) subsidiary and ceased its operations. The wind down was completed in July 2020. TDSI held a group of ultrasound machines as fixed assets. The Company sold these machines, and recorded a loss on sale of $18,500 during the year ended December 31, 2020. There was no loss on equipment during 2019.
Interest Expense
For the year ended December 31, 2020, interest expense was $7,271 compared to $258,365 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $251,094 or 97%, was due primarily to the amortization of the valuation discount of the March 2019 convertible notes of $233,455 that was reflected as an expense when the notes were converted to equity in April 2019.
Finance Cost Upon Issuance of Warrants
Finance costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $0. Finance costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $415,955. The 2019 finance costs result from the two transactions. First, in March 2019, the Company issued warrants to two convertible note holders pursuant to the anticipated completion of the Company’s IPO (the IPO was completed on April 9, 2019), and due to the variable terms of both the exercise price and the number of warrants to be issued, the warrants were accounted for as derivative liabilities at March 31, 2019. The fair value of the warrants at the closing of the IPO was determined to be $436,034, of which $250,000 was recorded as a valuation discount, and $186,034 was recorded as a finance cost. Second, on April 4, 2019, the Company issued 10,417 warrants with an exercise price of $30.00 per share to the Underwriter in connection with the Company’s IPO, that were accounted for as a derivative liability. The fair value of the warrants at the date of issuance was determined to be $229,921 and was recorded as a finance cost.
Change in Fair Value of Derivative Warrants
In 2019, the fair value of warrants classified as derivative liabilities totaled $665,955 upon issuance. During 2019, derivative warrants with a fair value of $359,683 were reclassified to equity, and a decrease in the fair value of derivatives warrant liabilities of $292,949 was recorded. At December 31, 2019, the balance of derivative warrant liabilities was $13,323. During 2020, an increase in the fair value of derivative warrant liabilities of $12,655 was recorded, and at December 31, 2020, the balance of derivative warrant liabilities was $25,978. The decrease in change in derivative warrant liabilities was primarily due to the reclassification of derivative warrant liabilities to equity in 2019. There was no such reclassification in 2020.
Net Loss
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred a net loss of $8,571,657, compared to a net loss of $10,878,308 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in net loss of $2,306,651 or 21% compared to the prior year period was primarily due to increased revenues, a decrease in certain operating costs, and an offsetting increase to cost of goods sold for write off of inventory.
Segment Information
The following tables set forth our results of operations by segment:
The. Medical Foods and Nutraceuticals segment provides a portfolio of science-based, clinically supported nutrition, medical foods, and supplements. Our products include, among others, Lumega-Z, GlaucoCetin and ImmuneSF.
The Medical Devices segment includes a portfolio of medical diagnostic devices currently focused on the ocular space and is the industry leader in contrast testing. Our products include VectorVision CSV-1000, CSV-1000HGT, CSV-2000 and associated accessories as well as the MapcatSF.
See Note 13 for further details on our reportable segments.
Revenue
For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue from our Medical Foods and Nutraceuticals segment was $1,609,482 compared to $444,657 for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting in an increase of $1,164,825 or 262%. The increase is due primarily to the completion of an order to a Malaysian customer for an immune-supportive formula that was delivered in June 2020 and the Company recognized revenue for this order of $890,000 at such time. For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue from our Medical Devices segment was $275,862 compared to $434,010 for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting in a decrease of $158,148 or 36%, primarily as a result of medical facility and office closures due to COVID-19 “Stay at Home” orders. The decrease was offset in part from the sale of a MapCat device in January 2020. The severity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business will continue to depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic and the extent and severity of the impact on the Company’s customers, service providers and suppliers, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.
Cost of Goods Sold
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cost of goods sold from our Medical Foods and Nutraceuticals segment was $1,599,510 compared to $155,212 for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting in an increase of $1,444,298 or 931%. The increase was primarily due to the increase in cost associated with the Malaysian order in addition to a write down of $760,488 for allowance of excess and obsolete nutraceutical inventory. For the year ended December 31, 2020, cost of goods sold from our Medical Devices segment was $344,647 compared to $178,815 for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting in an increase of $165,832 or 93%. The increase was due to a write down of $211,231 for allowance of excess and obsolete medical device inventory. In addition, a $13,000 inventory adjustment affecting cost of sales due primarily to the write off of scrap materials was recorded in March 2020.
Gross Profit (Loss)
For the year ended December 31, 2020, gross loss from the Medical Foods and Nutraceuticals segment was $9,972 compared to $289,445 for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting in a decrease of $279,473 or 97%. For the year ended December 31, 2020, gross profit from the Medical Devices segment was $(68,785) compared to $255,195 for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting in a decrease of $323,980 or 127 %. Gross loss represented (3)% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, versus 62% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. The lower gross profit percentage in FY 2020 is primarily a result of the write down of inventory.
Goodwill Impairment Charge
Management concluded that as of December 31, 2019, the fair value of the goodwill associated with the VectorVision acquisition was less than its carrying amount. For the year ended December 31, 32019, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1,563,520.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since its formation in 2009, the Company has devoted substantial effort and capital resources to the development and commercialization activities related to its product candidates. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred a net loss of $8,571,657 and used cash in operating activities of $8,013,929. At December 31, 2020, the Company had cash on hand of $8,518,732 and working capital of $8,021,152. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company sold an aggregate of 7,566,734 shares of its common stock for net proceeds of approximately $33,600,000 in two offerings, one completed in January 2021, and one completed in February 2021. In addition, in January and February 2021, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,647,691 shares of common stock upon the exercise of warrants and received cash proceeds of $3,608,509. Notwithstanding the net loss for 2020, management believes that its current cash balance, plus net proceeds from issuance of common stock and exercise of warrants in January 2021 and February 2021, is sufficient to fund operations for at least one year from the date the Company’s 2020 financial statements are issued.
The Company’s financing has historically come primarily from the issuance of convertible notes, promissory notes and from the sale of common and preferred stock. The Company will continue to incur significant expenses for continued commercialization activities related to its medical foods, medical devices and its nutraceuticals product line, and building its infrastructure. Development and commercialization of medical foods, medical devices and nutraceuticals involves a lengthy and complex process. Additionally, the Company’s long-term viability and growth may depend upon the successful development and commercialization of new complementary products or product lines.
The Company may continue to seek to raise additional debt and/or equity capital to fund future operations and acquisitions as necessary, but there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to secure such additional financing in the amounts necessary to fully fund its operating requirements on acceptable terms or at all. Over time, if the Company is unable to access sufficient capital resources on a timely basis, the Company may be forced to reduce or discontinue its technology and product development programs and curtail or cease operations.
Sources and Uses of Cash
The following table sets forth the Company’s major sources and uses of cash for each of the following periods:
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $8,013,929 during the year ended December 31, 2020, versus $6,030,004 used during the comparable prior year period. The increase in 2020 was due primarily to inventory purchases and higher insurance, professional services fees, consulting, and labor costs paid in the current period.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $34,733 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $171,076 for the year ended December 30, 2019. Cash was used in both periods for the purchase of testing equipment, furniture and fixtures.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $5,451,892 for the year ended December 31, 2020, and was due to warrant exercises during the period. Net cash provided by financing activities was $9,236,167 for the year ended December 31, 2019 was due primarily to the completion of our IPO, which resulted in net proceeds of $3,888,000. In addition, in March 2019, the Company issued $350,000 in promissory and convertible promissory notes and received cash of $131,875 from the exercise of warrants. These proceeds were partially offset by payment of $100,000 to settle a promissory note.
On August 15, 2019, the Company completed a second public offering (the “August Offering”) of (i) 2,000,000 shares of common stock, (ii) pre-funded warrants exercisable for 166,667 shares of common stock (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”), and (iii) warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,166,667 shares of common stock (the “August Warrants”). The August Offering was conducted pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, dated August 13, 2019 by and between the Company and Maxim Group LLC and WallachBeth Capital, LLC. On August 16, 2019, the Company sold an additional 325,000 August Warrants upon exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. The net proceeds to the Company from the August Offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated expenses were $4,944,340.
The public offering price was $2.64 per share of common stock and $0.01 per accompanying August Warrant. Each August Warrant represents the right to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $3.51 per share. The August Warrants are exercisable immediately, expire five years from the date of issuance and provide that, beginning on the earlier of (i) September 11, 2019 and (ii) the date on which the common stock traded an aggregate of more than 6,666,667 shares after the announcement of the pricing of the August Offering, and ending on the twelve (12) month anniversary thereof, each August Warrant may be exercised at the option of the holder on a cashless basis at a ratio of one August Warrant for one share of common stock, in whole or in part, if the weighted average price of the Common Stock on the trading day immediately prior to the exercise date fails to exceed the initial exercise price of the August Warrant.
On October 30, 2019, the Company completed a third public offering of 4,083,334 shares of its common stock (including 283,334 pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock in lieu thereof) and Series B warrants to purchase up to 4,083,334 shares of the Company’s common stock. Each share of common stock (or pre-funded warrant) was sold together with one Series B warrant to purchase one share of common stock at a combined price to the public of $2.052 per share and Series B warrant. The shares of common stock or pre-funded warrants and the accompanying Series B warrants were sold together but will be issued separately and will be immediately separable upon issuance. Net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, were approximately $7.4 million.
The Series B warrants are exercisable at a price of $2.052 per share of common stock and will expire five years from the date on which the Series B warrants become initially exercisable. On December 6, 2019, pursuant to shareholder approval, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to amends its Certificate of Incorporation to increase its authorized shares of common stock to 250 million shares. Thus, the Company has a sufficient number of authorized shares of common stock to issue the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Series B warrants.
