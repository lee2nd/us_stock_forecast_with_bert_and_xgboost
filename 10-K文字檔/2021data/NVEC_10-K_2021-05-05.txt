ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
You should read this discussion together with our financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this Report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual future results could differ materially from those presently anticipated due to a variety of factors, including those discussed in Item 1A of this Report.
General
We develop and sell devices that use “spintronics,” a nanotechnology that relies on electron spin rather than electron charge to acquire, store, and transmit information. We manufacture high-performance spintronic products including sensors and couplers to revolutionize data sensing and transmission. We also receive contracts for research and development and are a licensor of spintronic magnetoresistive random access memory technology, commonly known as MRAM.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
In accordance with SEC guidance, those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment are discussed below.
Investment Valuation
Our investments consist primarily of corporate obligations. We have generally invested excess cash in high-quality investment grade long-term marketable securities with less than five years to maturity. We classify all of our marketable securities as available-for-sale, thus securities are recorded at fair value and any associated unrealized gain or loss, net of tax, is included as a separate component of shareholders’ equity, “Accumulated other comprehensive income.” If we judged a decline in fair value for any security to be other than temporary, the cost basis of the individual security would be written down and a charge recognized to net income. The fair values for our securities are determined based on quoted market prices as of the valuation date and observable prices for similar assets. We consider a number of factors in determining whether other-than-temporary impairment exists, including: credit market conditions; the credit ratings of the securities; historical default rates for securities of comparable credit rating; the presence of insurance of the securities and, if insured, the credit rating and financial condition of the insurer; the effect of market interest rates on the value of the securities; and the duration and extent of any unrealized losses. We also consider the likelihood that we will be required to sell the securities prior to maturity based on our financial condition and anticipated cash flows. If any of these conditions and estimates change in the future, or, if different estimates are used, the fair value of the investments may change significantly and could result in other-than-temporary decline in value, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
Inventory Valuation
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by the first in, first out method. Where there is evidence that inventory could be disposed of at less than carrying value, the inventory is written down to the net realizable value in the current period. Additionally, we periodically examine our inventory in the context of inventory turnover, sales trends, competition and other market factors, and we record provisions to inventory reserve when we determine certain inventory is unlikely to be sold. If reserved inventory is subsequently sold, corresponding reductions in inventory and inventory reserves are made. Our inventory reserve was $230,000 as of March 31, 2021 and $210,000 as of March 31, 2020.
Deferred Tax Assets Estimation
In determining the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets, we must assess the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, based on estimates and assumptions to realize the benefit of these assets. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred assets quarterly and assess the need for valuation allowances or reduction of existing allowances quarterly. No valuation allowance was recorded as we believe it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.
We had $73,538 of net deferred tax assets as of March 31, 2021 and $108,119 as of March 31, 2020. Net deferred tax assets included $75,189 in deferred tax assets for stock-based compensation deductions as of March 31, 2021 and $65,218 as of March 31, 2020.
Results of Operations
The following table summarizes the percentage of revenue and year-to-year changes for various items for the last two fiscal years:
Total revenue for fiscal 2021 decreased 16% compared to fiscal 2020 due to a 16% decrease in product sales and a 18% decrease in contract research and development revenue. The decrease in product sales was primarily due to decreased purchases by existing customers. The decrease in contract research and development revenue was due to the completion of certain contracts.
Total expenses decreased 10% for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due primarily to a 14% decrease in research and development expense. The decrease in research and development expense was primarily due to the completion of certain new-product development projects.
Interest income for fiscal 2021 decreased 16% due to a decrease in our available-for-sale securities and a decrease in the average interest rates on those securities.
Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 18% of income before taxes compared to 16% for fiscal 2020. The smaller effective rate for fiscal 2020 was due to tax benefits from the Federal Tax Reform Act enacted in 2017. We currently expect our tax rate for fiscal 2022 to be approximately 18%.
The decrease in net income in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year was primarily due to decreases in revenue and interest income, partially offset by a decrease in total expenses.
The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
We believe the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on total revenue and net income for fiscal 2021 due to its effects on market conditions in certain industries, especially medical devices. We believe the effects of the pandemic on our business began to subside in the second half of fiscal 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
Cash and cash equivalents were $10,427,340 as of March 31, 2021 compared to $8,065,594 as of March 31, 2020. The $2,361,746 increase in cash and cash equivalents was due to $13,364,832 in net cash provided by operating activities and $8,424,873 net cash provided by investing activities, partially offset by $19,427,959 net cash used in financing activities.
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities related to product sales and research and development contract revenue as our primary source of working capital for fiscal 2021 and 2020. Net cash provided by operating activities was $13,364,832 for fiscal 2021 and $15,895,773 for fiscal 2020.
Accounts receivable decreased $729,737 primarily due to the timing of sales to and payments from customers.
Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2021 was due to marketable security maturities of $19,000,000, partially offset by marketable security purchases of $10,512,400 and fixed assets purchases of $62,727.
Purchases of fixed assets were $62,727 in fiscal 2021 and $52,041 in fiscal 2020. Purchases were primarily for capital equipment and leasehold improvements and were financed with cash provided by operating activities. Our capital expenditures have been significantly higher in prior years and can vary from year to year depending on our needs and equipment purchasing opportunities.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 was due to $19,336,540 in cash dividends to shareholders and $91,419 in repurchases of our common stock.
In addition to cash dividends to shareholders paid in fiscal 2021, on May 5, 2021 we announced that our Board had declared a cash dividend of $1.00 per share of Common Stock, or $4,833,232 based on shares outstanding as of April 30, 2021, to be paid May 31, 2021. We plan to fund dividends through cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from maturities of marketable securities. All future dividends will be subject to Board approval and subject to the company’s results of operations, cash and marketable security balances, estimates of future cash requirements, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and other factors the Board may deem relevant. Furthermore, dividends may be modified or discontinued at any time without notice.
We believe our working capital and cash generated from operations will be adequate for our needs at least through fiscal 2022.
