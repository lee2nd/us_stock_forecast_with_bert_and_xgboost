ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This document contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact are “forward-looking statements” for purposes of federal and state securities laws, including, but not limited to, any projections of earnings, revenue or other financial items; any statements of the plans, strategies and objections of management for future operations; any statements concerning proposed new services or developments; any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; any statements or belief; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing.
Forward-looking statements may include the words “may,” “could,” “estimate,” “intend,” “continue,” “believe,” “expect” or “anticipate” or other similar words and may include:
·
projections about accounting and finances;
·
plans and objectives for the future;
·
projections or estimates about assumptions relating to our performance; or
·
our opinions, views or beliefs about the effects of current or future events, circumstances or performance.
These forward-looking statements present our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. Except for our ongoing securities laws, we do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update any forward-looking statement.
Although we believe that the expectations reflected in any of our forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in any or our forward-looking statements. Our future financial condition and results of operations, as well as any forward-looking statements, are subject to change and inherent risks and uncertainties. The factors impacting these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:
·
Our results are vulnerable to economic conditions;
·
Our ability to raise adequate working capital;
·
Loss of customers or sales weakness;
·
Inability to achieve sales levels or other operating results;
·
The unavailability of funds for capital expenditures;
·
Operational inefficiencies;
·
Increased competitive pressures from existing competitors and new entrants;
You should view these statements with caution. These statements are no guarantees of future performance, circumstances or events. They are based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the date the statements are made. All aspects of our business are subject to uncertainties, risks and other influences, many of which we do not control. Any of these factors, either alone or taken together, could have a material adverse effect on us and could change whether any forward-looking statement ultimately turns out to be true. Additionally, we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result of future events, circumstances or developments. The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto. Outlined below are some of the risks that we believe could affect our business and financial statements for 2020 and beyond and that could cause actual results to be materially different from those that may be set forth in forward-looking statements that we make.
GENERAL
Recent Developments
Overview
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.
Inflation
The amounts presented in the financial statements do not provide for the effect of inflation on our operations or financial position. The net operating losses shown would be greater than reported if the effects of inflation were reflected either by charging operations with amounts that represent replacement costs or by using other inflation adjustments.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included herein for our fiscal years ended February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2021.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The recent accounting pronouncements applicable to the Company are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included herein for our fiscal years ended February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2021.
Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Revenues
Our revenues for the years ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020 were $1,110,397 and $1,371,625, respectively, reflecting decreased revenues of $261,228. The $261,228 decreased revenues are primarily attributable to slowdown of the economy from lockdowns due to the Covid 19 pandemic and subsequent decrease in transactional revenue in our South African business.
Net Profit/Net Loss
We had a net loss of $179,543 for the year ended February 28, 2021 and a net loss of $20,702 for the year February 29, 2020, reflecting decreased net loss of $158,841, which is primarily attributable to decrease in revenue in our South African operations. We had a working capital surplus of $8,172and $39,440 at February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, respectively. The $8,172 of working capital surplus in fiscal year 2020 is primarily attributable to increase in current liabilities.
Operating Expenses
We incurred total expenses of $984,390 and $1,016,563 for the years ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, respectively, reflecting a decrease of $32,173 from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021. The decrease in total expenses from the prior fiscal year is primarily attributable to our decreasing operational cost, contributing to general and administrative expenses of $929,441 from fiscal year 2021 compared to $961,620 from fiscal year 2020, representing a $32,179 decrease in general and administrative expenses.
Our net cash flows used in operating activities was $(102,547) for the year ended February 28, 2021 compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of $(394,841) for the year ended February 29, 2020, representing a decrease of $292,294.
Our net cash provided by investing activities were $(25,905) and $(8,052) for the years ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, respectively, reflecting a $17,853 increase in net cash used in investing activities. This $17,853 increase in net cash used in investing activities is primarily attributable to an investment made into MiWay Finance.
Our net cash provided by financing activities was $144,119 and $1,551 for the fiscal years ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, respectively, representing a $142,568 increase from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021.
We estimate that we will have operating costs of $1,200,000 from June 14, 2021 to the remainder of fiscal year 2021 assuming we receive sufficient funding.
Going forward, our monthly estimated cash needs of $140,000 over the next 12 months from June 2021 to June 2022 including the following estimated expenditures:
These estimated expenditures are based upon current expenses and anticipated increases and growth.
We plan on meeting our cash needs over the next 12 months, including our SEC reporting costs, through our current cash position of $57,100 as of June 14, 2021 and our existing business in South Africa although we cannot provide any assurances whatsoever that we will generate sufficient revenues to meet these cash needs.
