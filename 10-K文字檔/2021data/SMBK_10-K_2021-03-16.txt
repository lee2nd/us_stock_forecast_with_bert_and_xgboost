Business Overview
We are a bank holding company that was incorporated on September 19, 1983 under the laws of the State of Tennessee, and operate primarily through our wholly-owned bank subsidiary, SmartBank. SmartBank provides a comprehensive suite of commercial and consumer banking services to clients through 35 full-service bank branches and one loan production office in select markets in East and Middle Tennessee, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle.
While we offer a wide range of commercial banking services, we focus on making loans secured primarily by commercial real estate and other types of secured and unsecured commercial loans to small and medium-sized businesses in a number of industries, as well as loans to individuals for a variety of purposes. Our principal sources of funds for loans and investing in securities are deposits and, to a lesser extent, borrowings. We offer a broad range of deposit products, including checking (“NOW”), savings, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. We actively pursue business relationships by utilizing the business contacts of our senior management, other bank officers and our directors, thereby capitalizing on our knowledge of our local market areas.
Executive Summary
The following is a summary of the Company’s financial highlights and significant events during 2020:
● Completed the acquisition and integration of Progressive Financial Group, Inc. ("PFG").
● Originated approximately 2,950 Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans totaling $300.8 million.
● Net income totaled $24.3 million, or $1.62 per diluted common share, during the year ended of 2020 compared to $26.5 million, or $1.89 per diluted common share, for the same period in 2019.
● Ended 2020 with record high total assets of $3.3 billion, net loans of $2.4 billion, and deposits of $2.8 billion.
● Return on average assets was 0.79% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 1.13% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
● Allowance for loan losses increased to $18.3 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of 79.1% from the prior year, in response to the current economic conditions related to COVID-19.
● The COVID-19 pandemic has caused economic and social disruption on an unprecedented scale. Congress, former President Donald Trump, and the Federal Reserve have taken several actions designed to cushion the economic fallout. On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. It contained substantial tax and spending provisions intended to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act included the PPP, a nearly $350 billion program designed to aid small and medium-sized businesses through federally guaranteed loans distributed through banks. These loans were intended to guarantee eight weeks of payroll and other costs to help those businesses remain viable and allow their workers to pay their bills. The initial $350 billion program was supplemented in late April 2020 with $310 billion in additional funding. On June 5, 2020, the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act (the “new Act”) was signed into law and made significant changes to the PPP to provide additional relief for small businesses. The new Act increased flexibility for small businesses that have been unable to rehire employees due to lack of employee availability or have been unable to operate as normal due to COVID-19 related restrictions. It extended the period that businesses have to use PPP funds to qualify for loan forgiveness to 24 weeks, up from 8 weeks under the original rules. The new Act also relaxed the requirements that loan recipients must adhere to in order to qualify for loan forgiveness. In addition, the new Act extended the payment deferral period for PPP loans until the date when the amount of loan forgiveness is determined and remitted to the lender. For PPP recipients who do not apply for forgiveness, the loan deferral period is 10 months after the applicable forgiveness period ends. The PPP program expired August 8, 2020.
● On December 21, 2020, the Bipartisan-Bicameral Omnibus COVID Relief Deal, included as a component of appropriations legislation, was passed by Congress to provide economic stimulus to individuals and businesses in further response to the economic distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other things, the legislation includes (i) payments of $600 for individuals making up to $75,000 per year, (ii) extension of the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation program to include a $300 weekly enhancement in unemployment benefits beginning after December 26, 2020 up to March 14, 2021, (iii) a temporary and targeted rental assistance program, and extends the eviction moratorium through January 31, 2021, (iv) targeted funding related to transportation, education, agriculture, nutrition and other public health measures and (v) approximately $325 billion for small business relief, including approximately $284 billion for a second round of PPP loans and a new simplified forgiveness procedure for PPP loans of $150,000 or less. We are continuing to monitor the potential development of additional legislation and further actions taken by the U.S. government.
Analysis of Results of Operations
2020 compared to 2019
Net income was $24.3 million, or $1.62 per diluted common share in 2020, compared to $26.5 million, or $1.89 per diluted common share in 2019. The tax equivalent net interest margin for 2020 was 3.61% compared to 3.95% for 2019. Noninterest income to average assets was 0.50% for 2020, decreasing from 0.65% for 2019. Noninterest expense to average assets decreased to 2.50% in 2020, from 2.70% in 2019. The results above include operating effects of the PFG acquisition, which was completed on March 1, 2020. Income tax expense was $6.6 million in 2020 with an effective tax rate of 21.2%, compared to $6.9 million in 2019 with an effective tax rate of 20.6%.
2019 compared to 2018
Net income was $26.5 million in 2019, compared to $18.1 million in 2018. Net income available to common shareholders was $26.5 million, or $1.89 per diluted common share, in 2019, compared to $18.1 million, or $1.45 per diluted common share, in 2018. The net interest margin, taxable equivalent, for 2019 was 3.95% compared to 4.43% for 2018. Noninterest income to average assets increased from 0.34% in 2018, to 0.65% in 2019, primarily due to the $6.4 million termination
fee from the termination of the Entegra merger. Noninterest expense to average assets decreased from 3.00% in 2018 to 2.70% in 2019 as the Company continued to capture economies of scale following the mergers with Foothills Bancorp, Inc. (“Foothills”) and Tennessee Bancshares, Inc. (“Tennessee Bancshares”). Income tax expense was $6.9 million in 2019 with an effective tax rate of 20.6%, compared to $3.2 million in 2018 with an effective tax rate of 15.2%.
Net Interest Income and Yield Analysis
The management of interest income and expense is fundamental to our financial performance. Net interest income, the difference between interest income and interest expense, is the largest component of the Company’s total revenue. Management closely monitors both total net interest income and the net interest margin (net interest income divided by average earning assets). We seek to maximize net interest income without exposing the Company to an excessive level of interest rate risk through our asset and liability policies. Interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the pricing, maturity and repricing options of all classes of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Our net interest margin is also adversely impacted by the reversal of interest on nonaccrual loans and the reinvestment of loan payoffs into lower yielding investment securities and other short-term investments.
2020 compared to 2019
Net interest income, taxable equivalent, increased to $101.4 million in 2020 from $84.3 million in 2019. Net interest income was positively impacted, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increases in loan balances and a reduction in interest expense on deposits. Average earning assets increased from $2.1 billion in 2019 to $2.8 billion in 2020, primarily as a result of the acquisition of PFG completed March 1, 2020, organic loan growth and the Company’s participation in the PPP. Over this period, average loan balances increased by $452.6 million, average interest-bearing deposits increased by $290.3 million, average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $227.7 million and average borrowings increased $155.7 million. The tax equivalent net interest margin decreased to 3.61% for 2020, compared to 3.95% for 2019. The yield on earning assets decreased from 5.10% for 2019, to 4.20% for 2020, primarily due to rate cuts by the Federal Reserve over the past year and, to a lesser extent loan yields declining from market competition. The cost of average interest-bearing deposits decreased from 1.35% for 2019, to 0.71% for 2020, primarily due to a lower interest rate environment during the period.
2019 compared to 2018
Net interest income, taxable equivalent, increased to $84.3 million in 2019 from $76.8 million in 2018. The increase in net interest income, taxable equivalent, was the result of a significant increase in earning assets primarily from the mergers with Foothills and Tennessee Bancshares but also from organic growth. Average earning assets increased from $1.7 billion in 2018 to $2.1 billion in 2019. Over this period, average loan balances increased by $327.9 million and average securities balances decreased by $23.1 million. In addition, total average interest-bearing deposits increased by $238.8 million. Net interest margin, taxable equivalent, was 3.95% in 2019, compared to 4.43% in 2018, with the decrease due to lower yields on earning assets from 5.32% in 2018 to 5.10% in 2019 an increase cost of interest bearing liabilities from 1.10% in 2018 to 1.46% in 2019.
Summary of Average Balances, Interest and Rates
The following table presents, for the periods indicated, information about: (i) weighted average balances, the total dollar amount of interest income from interest-earning assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) average balances, the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant average rates; (iii) net interest income; (iv) the interest rate spread; and (v) the net interest margin.
(1) Loans include PPP loans with an average balance of $201.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. No PPP loans are included in years ending December 31, 2019 and 2018. Loan fees included in loan income was $9.8 million, $3.2 million, and $2.7 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Loan fee income for the year ended December 31, 2020, includes $5.9 million accretion of loan fees on PPP loans. No loan fees on PPP loans are included in years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
(2) Yields related to investment securities exempt from income taxes are stated on a taxable-equivalent basis assuming a federal income tax rate of 21.0% in 2020, 2019 and 2018. The taxable-equivalent adjustment was $572 thousand, $454 thousand and $180 thousand for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Rate and Volume Analysis
Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. Net interest income, taxable equivalent, increased by $17.1 million between the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and by $7.5 million
between the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The following is an analysis of the changes in net interest income comparing the changes attributable to rates and those attributable to volumes (in thousands):
Changes in net interest income are attributed to either changes in average balances (volume change) or changes in average rates (rate change) for earning assets and sources of funds on which interest is received or paid. Volume change is calculated as change in volume times the previous rate while rate change is change in rate times the previous volume. The change attributed to rates and volumes (change in rate times change in volume) is considered above as a change in volume.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income is an important component of our total revenues. A significant portion of our noninterest income is associated service charges on deposit accounts and mortgage banking fees.
The following table provides a summary of noninterest income for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):
2020 compared to 2019
Noninterest income increased $111 thousand to $15.4 million in 2020, compared to $15.3 million in 2019. The change in noninterest income primarily resulted from the following:
● Increase in service charges on deposit accounts of $501 thousand, related to the PFG acquisition, deposit growth and transaction volume;
● Increase in mortgage banking of $2.3 million, from increased volume due to low rate environment;
● Increase in investment services of $620 thousand, stemming from increased production from personnel hires in 2019;
● Addition of insurance commissions of $1.8 million from an insurance agency acquired in the PFG acquisition;
● Increase in net interchange and debit card transactions fees, net of $1.8 million, related to the increased volume from the PFG acquisition and deposit growth; and
● Decrease in merger termination fee of $6.4 million, recognized in the second quarter of 2019.
2019 compared to 2018
Noninterest income increased $8.7 million to $15.3 million in 2019, compared to $6.9 million in 2018. The change in noninterest income primarily resulted from the following:
● Increase in merger termination fee of $6.4 million, received in connection with the termination of the Entegra merger in the second quarter of 2019;
● Increase in services charges on deposit accounts of $486 thousand, related to deposit growth and transaction volume;
● Increase in investment services of $557 thousand, stemming from increased production from personnel hires during 2019;
● Increase in other income of $1.1 million, primarily due to a one-time payment received from the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs ("ADECA"). ADECA was a program that guaranteed 50% of a loan’s obligation for loans approved and originated through the program. In September 2019, the ADECA program was dissolved and total proceeds of $1.2 million was received in October 2019, of which $720 thousand was recorded as noninterest income, and the remainder of the proceeds were held in reserve for potential future losses on specific identified loans that were covered in the program.
Noninterest Expense
The following table provides a summary of noninterest expense for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):
2020 compared to 2019
Noninterest expense increased $13.6 million to $76.7 million in 2020, compared to $63.2 million in 2019. The change in noninterest expense primarily resulted from the following:
● Increase in salary and employee benefits of $6.3 million, due to overall franchise growth, including the acquisition of PFG;
● Increase of occupancy and equipment of $1.6 million, associated with ongoing infrastructure and facilities added to accommodate our growth in operations and the additional branches from the PFG acquisition;
● Increase in FDIC insurance of $1.1 million, related to increase in assets due to overall assets growth stemming from our acquisition of PFG, deposit growth and production of PPP loans. The Company recognized a credit during 2019 from the FDIC, as result of the FDIC Insurance exceeding 1.38% of insured deposits as of June 30, 2019;
● Increase in other real and loan related expense of $730 thousand, primarily attributable to increased activity in loan related production;
● Increase in professional services of $583 thousand, due to increased volume of services performed;
● Increase in merger related and restructuring expenses of $1.3 million, from the acquisition of PFG and the consolidation and termination of two leased properties; and
● Increase in other noninterest expense of $1.4 million, due to overall franchise growth.
2019 compared to 2018
Noninterest expense increased $4.2 million to $63.2 million in 2019, compared to $59.0 million in 2018. The change in noninterest expense primarily resulted from the following:
● Increase in salary and employee benefits of $6.0 million, primarily because of a full year of post-merger expenses from the mergers in 2018 and to the lessor extent, the increased hiring of talented associates during 2019;
● Increase in occupancy and equipment of $413 thousand, primarily because of a full year of post-merger expenses from the mergers in 2018; and
● Decrease in FDIC insurance of $646 thousand, The Company recognized a credit in the third quarter of 2019 from the FDIC, as a result of the FDIC Insurance exceeding 1.38% of insured deposits as of June 30, 2019.
Income Taxes
2020 compared to 2019
In 2020, income tax expense totaled $6.6 million compared to $6.9 million a year ago. The effective tax rate was approximately 21.2% for 2020 compared to 20.6% a year ago.
2019 compared to 2018
In 2019, income tax expense totaled $6.9 million compared to $3.2 million in 2018. In 2019 the effective tax rate was 20.6%, which was lower than normal due to a tax benefit of $1.1 million associated with a program the State of Tennessee manages for community investment loans. The Bank strategically originated loans in this program to reduce its 2019 tax liability. In 2018 the effective tax rate was 15.2%, which was also lower than normal due to a tax benefit from options exercised in the prior period.
Loan Portfolio Composition
Our loans represent the largest portion of our earning assets, substantially greater than the securities portfolio or any other asset category, and the quality and diversification of the loan portfolio is an important consideration when reviewing our financial condition. The Company had total net loans outstanding, including organic and purchased loans, of approximately $2.36 billion at December 31, 2020 and $1.89 billion at December 31, 2019. Loans secured by real estate, consisting of commercial or residential property, are the principal component of our loan portfolio.
Organic Loans
Our organic net loans, which excludes loans purchased through acquisitions, increased by $469.8 million, or 31.1%, from December 31, 2019, to $1.98 billion at December 31, 2020. Included in the growth was $300.8 million of PPP loans that
were originated and funded during the second and third quarters of 2020. Total net deferred fees associated with the PPP loans during the year of 2020 was approximately $11.0 million and $5.9 million was accreted into income during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020.
Purchased Loans
Purchased non-credit impaired loans of $350.7 million at December 31, 2020 increased by $1.7 million from December 31, 2019. Since December 31, 2019, our net purchased credit impaired (“PCI”) loans increased by $5.2 million to $32.0 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in purchased non-credit impaired loans and PCI loans is related to the acquisition of PFG and offset by maturities, paydowns and payoffs.
The following tables summarize the composition of our loan portfolio for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):
Loan Portfolio Maturities
The following table sets forth the maturity distribution of our loans, including the interest rate sensitivity for loans maturing after one year (dollars in thousands):
Nonaccrual, Past Due, and Restructured Loans
Loans are considered past due when the contractual amounts due with respect to principal and interest are not received within 30 days of the contractual due date. Loans are generally classified as nonaccrual if they are past due for a period of 90 days or more, unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection. If a loan or a portion of a loan is classified as doubtful or as partially charged off, the loan is generally classified as nonaccrual. Loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than 90 days may also be classified as nonaccrual if repayment in full of principal and interest is in doubt. Loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time, and there is a sustained period of repayment performance of interest and principal by the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms.
PCI loans with common risk characteristics are grouped in pools at acquisition and performance is based on our ability to reasonably estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows rather than a borrower’s ability to repay contractual loan amounts. Since we are able to reasonably estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows on the Company’s PCI loan pools, none of these loans have been identified as nonaccrual.
While a loan is classified as nonaccrual and the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is doubtful, collections of interest and principal are generally applied as a reduction to the principal outstanding, except in the case of loans with scheduled amortizations where the payment is generally applied to the oldest payment due. When the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is expected, interest income may be recognized on a cash basis. In the case where a nonaccrual loan had been partially charged off, recognition of interest on a cash basis is limited to that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the contractual interest rate. Receipts in excess of that amount are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until prior charge-offs have been fully recovered.
Assets acquired as a result of foreclosure are recorded at estimated fair value in other real estate owned. Any excess of cost over estimated fair value at the time of foreclosure is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Valuations are periodically performed on these properties, and any subsequent write-downs are charged to earnings. Routine maintenance and other holding costs are included in noninterest expense.
Loans, excluding pooled PCI loans, are classified as troubled debt restructurings (“TDR”) by the Company when certain modifications are made to the loan terms and concessions are granted to the borrowers due to financial difficulty experienced by those borrowers. The Company grants concessions by (1) reduction of the stated interest rate for the remaining original life of the debt or (2) extension of the maturity date at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk. The Company does not generally grant concessions through forgiveness of principal or accrued interest. The Company’s policy with respect to accrual of interest on loans restructured in a TDR follows relevant supervisory guidance. That is, if a borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous loan terms and shows capacity to perform under the restructured loan terms, continued accrual of interest at the restructured interest rate is likely. If a borrower was materially delinquent on payments prior to the restructuring but shows the capacity to meet the restructured loan terms, the loan will likely continue as nonaccrual until there is demonstrated performance under new terms. Lastly, if the borrower does not perform under the restructured terms, the loan is placed on non-accrual status. The Company closely monitors these loans and ceases accruing interest on them if we believe that the borrowers may not continue performing based on the restructured note terms.
PCI loans that were classified as TDRs prior to acquisition are not classified as TDRs by the Company after the acquisition date. Subsequent modification of a PCI loan accounted for in a pool that would otherwise meet the definition of a TDR is not reported, or accounted for, as a TDR since pooled PCI loans are excluded from the scope of TDR accounting. A PCI loan not accounted for in a pool would be reported, and accounted for, as a TDR if modified in a manner that meets the definition of a TDR after the acquisition date.
Nonperforming loans as a percentage of gross loans, net of deferred fees, was 0.24% as of December 31, 2020, and 0.18% as of December 31, 2019, respectively. Total nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets as of December 31, 2020 totaled 0.31% compared to 0.21% as of December 31, 2019. PCI loans that are included in loan pools are reclassified at acquisition to accrual status and thus are not included as nonperforming assets. In 2020, there was $30 thousand in interest income recognized on nonaccrual and restructured loans compared to the $358 thousand in gross interest income that would have been recognized if the loans had been current in accordance with their original terms.
The following table summarizes the Company’s nonperforming assets as of December 31 for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):
Potential Problem Loans
At December 31, 2020 problem loans amounted to approximately $6.6 million or 0.27% of total loans outstanding. Potential problem loans, which are not included in nonperforming loans, represent those loans with a well-defined weakness and where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have doubts about the borrower’s ability to comply with present repayment terms. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by the Bank’s primary regulators, for loans classified as substandard or worse, but not considered nonperforming loans.
Allocation of the Allowance for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. Loans are charged-off against the allowance when management believes a loan balance is uncollectible. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for loan losses. Management’s methodology for estimating the allowance balance consists of several key elements, which include specific allowances on individual impaired loans and the formula driven allowances on pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management’s judgment, should be charged-off.
We assess the adequacy of the allowance at the end of each calendar quarter. This assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance. The level of the allowance is based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolios, past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, the views of the Bank’s regulators, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay (including the timing of future payments), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change.
We maintain the allowance at a level that we deem appropriate to adequately cover the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, our allowance for loan losses was $18.3 million and $10.2 million, respectively, which we deemed to be adequate at each of the respective dates. The increase in the allowance for loan losses in 2020 as compared to 2019 is primarily attributable to the ongoing economic uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, during 2020, the Company updated the Allowance for Loan Loss policy to increase the additional basis points allowed for the unallocated risk portion from 100 basis points to 125 basis points. In addition, the Company added two new qualitative factors; 1.) based on the percentage of COVID modified loans to total loans and 2.) the average number of COVID cases within our footprint. The qualitative factors were also expanded to provide additional granularity related to the hospitality and restaurant industries which are most impacted by the pandemic within our footprint. The changes in our economic factors and the addition of the COVID modified factors equated to an additional $8.3 million in reserve. Our allowance for loan loss as a percentage of total loans has increased from 0.54% at December 31, 2019, to 0.77% at December 31, 2020. This increase is primarily due to the economic uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the modified and additional qualitive factors, as discussed above for 2020.
Our purchased loans were recorded at fair value upon acquisition. The fair value adjustments on the performing purchased loans will be accreted into income over the life of the loans. At December 31, 2020, the remaining accretable yield was approximately $16.9 million. These loans are subject to the same allowance methodology as our legacy portfolio. The calculated allowance is compared to the remaining fair value discount to determine if additional provisioning should be recognized. Also, at the end of 2020, the outstanding principal balance on PCI loans was $45.0 million and the carrying value was $32.1 million, for a net difference of $12.9 million in discounts. At December 31, 2020, there was an allowance on PCI loans of $309 thousand. The judgments and estimates associated with our allowance determination are described in Note 1 in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”
The following table sets forth, the allocation of the allowance to types of loans as well as the unallocated portion as of December 31 for each of the past five years and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans (in thousands):
The increase in the overall allowance for loan losses is due to the economic uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the modified and additional qualitive factors, as discussed above for 2020. The allocation by category is determined based on the assigned risk rating, if applicable, and environmental factors applicable to each category of loans. For impaired loans, those loans are reviewed for a specific allowance allocation. Specific valuation allowances related to impaired loans were approximately $237 thousand at December 31, 2020, compared to $475 thousand at December 31, 2019. Additional information on the allocation of the allowance between performing and impaired loans is provided in Note 5 - Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses to our audited consolidated financial statements.
Analysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses
The following is a summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses for each of the years in the five-year period ended December 31, and the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans as of the end of each period (in thousands):
Investment Portfolio
Our investment portfolio is the second largest component of our interest earning assets. The portfolio serves the following purposes: (i) to optimize the Bank’s income consistent with the investment portfolio’s liquidity and risk objectives; (ii) to balance market and credit risks of other assets and the Bank’s liability structure; (iii) to profitably deploy funds which are not needed to fulfill loan demand, deposit redemptions or other liquidity purposes; and (iv) provide collateral which the Bank is required to pledge against public funds.
Our investment portfolio is carried at fair market value, and consists primarily of Federal agency bonds, mortgage-backed securities, state and municipal securities and other debt securities. Our investment portfolio increased from $178.3 million at December 31, 2019 to $215.6 million December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of the PFG acquisition and the appreciation of current portfolio holdings as market rates decreased throughout 2020. There was a shift in investment concentrations as the Bank migrated from mortgage-backed securities to municipal and agency securities to improve the portfolio structure by reducing the call optionality of the portfolio. Our investment portfolio decreased from $201.7 million in 2018 to $178.3 million in 2019, primarily as a result of liquidating certain investments to provide more funding for our loan production. Our investment to asset ratio has decreased from 8.9% at December 31, 2018, to 7.3% at December 31, 2019, and then decreased further to 6.5% at December 31, 2020. Over the last several years the ratio of investments to our total assets has decreased, primarily due to our loan growth outpacing deposit growth and reliance on brokered deposits.
The following table shows the amortized cost of the Company’s securities. In 2020, 2019, and 2018, all investment securities were classified as available for sale (dollars in thousands):
The following table presents the contractual maturity of the Company’s securities by contractual maturity date and average yields based on amortized cost (for all obligations on a fully taxable basis) at December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands). The composition and maturity/repricing distribution of the securities portfolio is subject to change depending on rate sensitivity, capital and liquidity needs.

Deposits
Deposits are the primary source of funds for the Company’s lending and investing activities. The Company provides a range of deposit services to businesses and individuals, including noninterest-bearing checking accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRAs") and certificates of deposit ("CDs"). These accounts generally earn interest at rates the Company establishes based on market factors and the anticipated amount and timing of funding needs. The establishment or continuity of a core deposit relationship can be
a factor in loan pricing decisions. While the Company’s primary focus is on establishing customer relationships to attract core deposits, at times, the Company uses brokered deposits and other wholesale deposits to supplement its funding sources. As of December 31, 2020, brokered deposits represented approximately 2.2% of total deposits.
The following table summarizes the average balances outstanding and average interest rates for each major category of deposits for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands):
During 2020 average deposits increased in all categories. The Company believes its deposit product offerings are properly structured to attract and retain core low-cost deposit relationships. The average cost of deposits was 0.55% in 2020 compared to 1.12% in 2019 as deposit costs increased with rising interest rates.
Total deposits as of December 31, 2020 were $2.8 billion, which was an increase of $758.0 million from December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily from the completed acquisition of PFG and deposits related to the PPP loans. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had outstanding time deposits under $250,000 of $412.0 million, time deposits over $250,000 of $138.5 million, and a time deposit fair value adjustment of $336 thousand. The following table summarizes the maturities of time deposits $250,000 or more as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):
Borrowings and Subordinated Debt
Other than deposits, the Company uses short-term borrowings and long-term debt to provide both funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory capital using debt at the Company level which can be downstreamed as Tier 1 capital to the Bank. Total borrowings at December 31, 2020 totaled $81.2 million, which is an increase of $49.6 million from December 31, 2019, the increase primarily consisted of a $50.0 million advance from the FHLB during 2020. Short-term borrowings, included in borrowings, totaled $5.8 million at December 31, 2020 and $6.2 million at December 31,2019 and consisted entirely of securities sold under repurchase agreements. Long-term debt totaled $39.3 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively and consisted entirely of subordinated debt. For more information regarding our borrowings and subordinated debt, see "Part I - Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 9 - Borrowings and Line of Credit and Note 10 - Subordinated Debt."
Liquidity
Liquidity refers to the measure of our ability to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, while at the same time meeting our operating, capital and strategic cash flow needs, all at a reasonable cost. We continuously monitor our liquidity position to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet all short-term and long-term cash requirements. We manage our liquidity position to meet the daily cash flow needs of customers, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of our shareholders.
Our liquidity position is supported by management of liquid assets and access to alternative sources of funds. Our liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits in correspondent banks, federal funds sold, and fair value of unpledged investment securities. Other available sources of liquidity include wholesale deposits, and additional borrowings from correspondent banks, FHLB advances, and the Federal Reserve discount window.
Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily met through cash flow from operations, redeployment of prepaying and maturing balances in our loan and investment portfolios, and increases in customer deposits. Other alternative sources of funds will supplement these primary sources to the extent necessary to meet additional liquidity requirements on either a short-term or long-term basis.
As part of our liquidity management strategy, we open federal funds lines with our correspondent banks. As of December 31, 2020, we had $69.6 million of unsecured federal funds lines with no funds advanced. In addition, we have access to the Federal Reserve’s discount window in the amount $149.2 million with no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2020. The Federal Reserve discount window line is collateralized by a pool of commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans totaling $258.8 million as of December 31, 2020.
At December 31, 2020, we had two FHLB advances outstanding totaling $75 million. For more information regarding the FHLB advances, see "Part I - Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 9 - Borrowings and Line of Credit." Based on the values of loans pledged as collateral, we had $35.5 million of additional borrowing availability with the FHLB as of December 31, 2020. We also maintain relationships in the capital markets with brokers to issue certificates of deposit and money market accounts.
The Company has a Loan and Security Agreement and revolving note with ServisFirst Bank, pursuant to which ServisFirst Bank has made a $25.0 million revolving line of credit available to the Company. The maturity of the line of credit is September 24, 2021. At December 31, 2020, there was no outstanding balance under the line of credit, and the entire amount of the line of credit remained available to the Company
Capital Requirements
The Bank is required under federal law to maintain certain minimum capital levels based on ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. The required capital ratios are minimums, and the federal banking agencies may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Risks such as concentration of credit risks and the risk arising from non-traditional activities, as well as the institution’s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates, and an institution’s ability to manage those risks are important factors that are to be taken into account by the federal banking agencies in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy. The Company uses leverage analysis to examine the potential of the institution to increase assets and liabilities using the current capital base. The key measurements included in this analysis are the Bank’s Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital, leverage and total capital ratios. At December 31, 2020, and 2019, our capital ratios, including our Bank’s capital ratios, exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements. From time to time we may be required to support the capital needs of our bank subsidiary. While the Company believes that it has sufficient capital to withstand an extended economic recession brought about by COVID-19, its reported and regulatory capital ratios could be adversely impacted in future periods. For more information regarding our capital, leverage and total capital ratios, see “Part I - Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 15 - Regulatory Matters.”
The table below summarizes the capital requirements applicable to the Bank in order to be considered “well-capitalized” from a regulatory perspective, as well as the Bank’s capital ratios as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and was considered to be “well-capitalized” as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the FDIC categorized the Bank as well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework. There have been no conditions or events since December 31, 2020 that management believes would change this classification. While the Company believes that it has sufficient capital to withstand an extended economic recession brought about by COVID-19, its reported and regulatory capital ratios could be adversely impacted in future periods.

Contractual Obligations
The following tables present, as of December 31, 2020 our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations (dollars in thousands):
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
At December 31, 2020, we had $476.8 million of pre-approved but unused lines of credit and $5.3 million of standby letters of credit. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon. The total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. If needed to fund these outstanding commitments, the Bank has the ability to liquidate Federal funds sold or securities available-for-sale, or on a short-term basis to borrow and purchase Federal funds from other financial institutions. Additional information about our off-balance sheet risk exposure is presented in Note 14-Commitments and Contingencies to our audited consolidated financial statements.
Critical Accounting Policies
The Company has identified accounting policies that are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate its reported financial results and require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Management has reviewed the following critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. These policies along with a brief discussion of the material implications of the uncertainties of each policy are below. For a full description of these critical accounting policies, see Note 1 in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”
Allowance for loan losses - In establishing the allowance we take into account reserves required for impaired loans, historical charge-offs for loan types, and a variety of qualitative factors including economic outlook, portfolio concentrations, and changes in portfolio credit quality. Many of the qualitative factors are measurable but there is also a level of subjective assumptions. If those assumptions change it could have a material impact on the level of the allowance required and as a result the earnings of the Company.
Fair values for acquired assets and assumed liabilities - Assets and liabilities acquired are recorded at their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the net estimated fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities is allocated to identifiable intangible assets with the remaining excess allocated to goodwill. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value. As of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $74.1 million in goodwill. Considering the recent economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic the Company performed a Step 1 goodwill impairment test (which compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill). The results indicated that there was no impairment as of December 31, 2020.
Cash flow estimates on purchased credit-impaired loans - Purchase credit impaired loans do not have traditional loan yields and interest income; instead they have accretable yield and accretion. Any excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable discount and is recognized in interest income as accretion over the remaining life of the loan when there is reasonable expectation about the amount and timing of such
cash flows. The amount expected to be accreted divided by the accretable discount is the accretable yield. Cash flow estimates are re-evaluated quarterly. If the estimated cash flows increase then the accretable yield over the life of the loan increases. If, however, the estimated cash flows decrease then impairment is generally recognized immediately.
Valuation of Other Real Estate Owned - Other real estate owned properties are initially recorded at fair value less selling costs. If the fair value decreases the assets are written down and are periodically reviewed for further impairment, if needed.
Valuation of deferred tax assets- Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be realized or sustained upon examination. The determination of whether or not a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date and is subject to management’s judgment. Deferred tax assets may be reduced by deferred tax liabilities and a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of evidence available, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2020, there were approximately $4.4 million in net deferred tax assets.
Evaluation of investment securities for other than temporary impairment- We evaluate investment securities for other than temporary impairment taking into account if we do not have the intent to sell a debt security prior to recovery and it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell the debt security prior to recovery, the security would not be considered other than temporarily impaired unless a credit loss has occurred in the security. Temporary impairments are recognized on the balance sheet in other comprehensive income / loss. If a security becomes permanently impaired the impairment expense would be recognized and reduce earnings. As of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $201 thousand in gross unrealized losses on investment securities that were classified as temporarily impaired.
