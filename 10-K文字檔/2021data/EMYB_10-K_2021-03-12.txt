Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
This discussion and analysis provides an overview of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report.
Critical Accounting Policies
Note 1 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements lists significant accounting policies used in the development and presentation of its financial statements. This discussion and analysis, the significant accounting policies, and other financial statement disclosures identify and address key variables and other qualitative and quantitative factors that are necessary for an understanding and evaluation of the Company and its results of operations.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”), which require the Company to make estimates and assumptions. The Company believes that its determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of deferred tax assets involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than the Company’s other significant accounting policies. Further, these estimates can be materially impacted by changes in market conditions or the actual or perceived financial condition of the Company’s borrowers, subjecting the Company to significant volatility of earnings.
Securities classified as available for sale are those securities that the Company intends to hold for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily to maturity. Securities available for sale are carried at fair value. Any decision to sell a security classified as available for sale would be based on various factors, including significant movement in interest rates, changes in maturity mix of the Company’s assets and liabilities, liquidity needs, regulatory capital considerations and other similar factors. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as increases or decreases in other comprehensive income. Realized gains or losses, determined on the basis of the cost of the specific securities sold, are included in earnings. Premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities.
Other-than-temporary impairment accounting guidance specifies that (a) if a company does not have the intent to sell a debt security prior to recovery and (b) it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the debt security prior to recovery, the security would not be considered other-than-temporarily impaired unless there is a credit loss. When an entity does not intend to sell the security, and it is more likely than not the entity will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis, it will recognize the credit component of an other-than-temporary impairment of a debt security in earnings and the remaining portion in other comprehensive income. The Company recognized no other-than-temporary impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The allowance for loan losses is established through the provision for loan losses, which is a charge against earnings. Provision for loan losses is made to reserve for estimated probable losses on loans. The allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by the Company for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, trends in actual and forecasted credit quality, including delinquency, charge-off and bankruptcy rates, and current economic conditions that may affect a borrower’s ability to pay. The use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provision for loan losses. For additional discussion concerning the Company’s allowance for loan losses and related matters, see “Provision for Loan Losses” and “Allowance for Loan Losses.”
Real estate acquired through foreclosure, or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of acquisition or transfer, and subsequently at the lower of its new cost or fair value less estimated selling costs. Adjustments to the carrying value at the date of acquisition or transfer are charged to the allowance for loan losses. The carrying value of the individual properties is subsequently adjusted to the extent it exceeds estimated fair value less the estimated selling costs, at which time a provision for loan losses on such real estate is charged to operations. Appraisals are critical in determining the value of properties. Overly optimistic assumptions or negative changes to assumptions could significantly affect the valuation of a property. The assumptions supporting such
Embassy Bancorp, Inc.
appraisals are carefully reviewed by management to determine that the resulting values reasonably reflect amounts realizable.
Deferred taxes are provided on the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and net operating loss carryforwards and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences.
GENERAL
The Company is a Pennsylvania corporation organized in 2008 and registered as a bank holding company pursuant to the BHC Act. The Company was formed for purposes of acquiring the Bank in connection with the reorganization of the Bank into a bank holding company structure, which was consummated on November 11, 2008. Accordingly, the Company owns all of the capital stock of the Bank, giving the organization more flexibility in meeting its capital needs as the Company continues to grow.
The Bank, which is the Company’s primary operating subsidiary, was originally incorporated as a Pennsylvania bank on May 11, 2001 and opened its doors on November 6, 2001. It was formed by a group of local business persons and professionals with significant prior experience in community banking in the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania, the Bank’s primary market area.
Since its inception, the Board’s philosophy has been that, by running the Bank with a view toward the long term, only good things will happen for the Bank’s customers, team members, shareholders, and the Lehigh Valley community.
OVERVIEW
The Company’s assets grew $265.9 million from $1.2 billion at December 31, 2019 to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2020. The Company’s deposits grew $200.4 million from $1.0 billion at December 31, 2019 to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2020. The growth in the Company’s deposits resulted primarily from a relationship building, sales and marketing effort, which served to further increase the Company’s overall presence in the market it serves, deposit relationships developed as a result of cross-marketing efforts to its loan and other non-depository banking service customers along with an injection of federal stimulus money into the economy in 2020 from PPP funds and consumer stimulus payments. The Bank also continued to capitalize on opportunities created by merger announcements, name changes, and competitive branch closures in the Company’s market area, attracting customers looking to relocate to a local, reputable community bank. During the same period, loans receivable (not including PPP loans), net of the allowance for loan losses, increased $73.2 million to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2020 from $1.0 billion at December 31, 2019 and PPP loans had a balance of $54.3 million as of December 31, 2020. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the market continues to be very competitive and the Company is committed to maintaining a high-quality portfolio that returns a reasonable market rate. While the past and current economic and competitive conditions in the marketplace have created more competition for loans to credit-worthy customers, the Company continues to expand its market presence and continues to focus on developing a reputation as being a market leader in both commercial and consumer/mortgage lending. Management believes that this combination of relationship building, cross marketing and responsible underwriting will translate into continued long-term growth of a portfolio of quality loans and core deposit relationships, although there can be no assurance of this. The Company continues to monitor interest rate exposure of its interest-bearing assets and liabilities and believes that it is well positioned for any anticipated future market rate adjustments.
The Company’s net income increased $1.9 million, or 17.7%, to $12.8 million from $10.9 million in 2019. Diluted earnings per share increased to $1.70 in 2020 from $1.44 in 2019, and basic earnings per share increased to $1.71 in 2020 from $1.46 in 2019, respectively. The difference in net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 resulted, in part, from an increase in net interest income due to the Company’s loan portfolio
Embassy Bancorp, Inc.
growth, due to PPP loan interest and fee income, and a decrease in interest expense primarily due to a lower cost of funds. Also, contributing to the increase in net income is the increase in bank owned life insurance, gain on the sale of securities, gain on the sale of loans, a decrease in occupancy and equipment, a decrease in advertising and promotions, and a decrease in other expenses, offset by an increase in the provision for loan losses, a decrease in merchant processing and credit card processing fees, a decrease in other service fees, no gain on the sale of real estate owned, an increase in salary and employee benefits, an increase in data processing, an increase in professional fees, and an increase in FDIC insurance.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
The majority of the Company’s earnings derives from net interest income, which is the difference between income earned on assets and the cost supporting those assets. The net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets. Earning assets are composed primarily of loans and investments, along with interest-bearing deposits with other banks. Interest-bearing deposits and borrowings make up the cost of funds. Non-interest bearing deposits and capital are other components representing funding sources. Changes in the volume and mix of assets and funding sources, along with the changes in yields earned and rates paid, determine changes in net interest income and net interest margin. The timing of deposit and loan growth also impact net interest income.
Generally, changes in net interest income are measured by net interest rate spread and net interest margin. Interest rate spread is the mathematical difference between the average interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities. Interest margin represents the net interest yield on earning assets. The interest margin gives a reader a better indication of asset earning results when compared to peer groups or industry standards.
The Company determines interest rate spread and margin on both US GAAP and tax equivalent basis. The use of tax equivalent basis in determining interest rate spread and margin is considered a non-US GAAP measure. The Company believes use of this measure provides meaningful information to the reader of the consolidated financial statements when comparing taxable and non-taxable assets. However, it is supplemental to US GAAP which is used to prepare the Company’s consolidated financial statements and should not be read in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for US GAAP measures. In addition, the non-US GAAP measure may not be comparable to non-US GAAP measures reported by other companies. The tax rate used to calculate the tax equivalent adjustments was 21% for 2020, 2019, and 2018.
2020 Compared to 2019
Total interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $44.3 million, compared to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Total interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $6.4 million, compared to $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net interest income increased 13.1% to $37.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $33.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The improvement in net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 is in part the result of a decrease in the balance and rates of certificates of deposit and FHLBank Pittsburgh (“FHLB”) short-term borrowings, and a decrease in the rates of interest bearing demand deposits, NOW, money market, savings accounts, and securities sold under agreement to repurchase. Also contributing to the improvement in net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was an increase in the balances of taxable loans, taxable investments, interest bearing deposits with banks, and interest income and fees from PPP loans. The improvements were offset, in part, by a decrease in the rates of taxable and non-taxable loans, taxable and non-taxable investments, fed funds sold and interest bearing deposits with banks, a decrease in the balance of non-taxable loans and non-taxable investments, an increase in the balance of interest bearing demand deposits, NOW and money markets, savings, FHLB long-term borrowings, and interest expense from Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (“PPPLF”) borrowings. The Company’s net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 3.01% on a US GAAP basis and 3.03% on a non-US GAAP basis, compared to 3.06% on a US GAAP basis and 3.09% on a non-US GAAP basis for the year ended December 31, 2019.
In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Federal Reserve Board in mid-March 2020 reduced by 150 basis points the benchmark fed funds rate to a target range of 0% to 0.25%, and the yields on 10 year and 30 year Treasury notes
Embassy Bancorp, Inc.
have declined to historic lows. As a result of the decline in the Federal Reserve Board’s target federal funds rate and yields on Treasury notes, the Company’s future net interest margin and spread may be further reduced. The Company’s net interest margin was also affected by the PPP loans, which bear interest at a rate of 1.0%, and the PPPLF borrowings added during the year. The net interest margin on a non-US GAAP basis excluding PPP loans and PPP interest income and PPPLF borrowings interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 3.04%.

The table below demonstrates the relative impact on net interest income of changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and changes in rates earned and paid by the Company on such assets and liabilities.
Provision for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged against income. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.
The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level management considers to be adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated. Management’s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change. The Company has determined, because of the 100% SBA guarantee, that no allowance for loan losses is required on PPP loans.
Embassy Bancorp, Inc.
The allowance consists of general, specific, qualitative, and unallocated components. The general component covers non-classified loans and classified loans not considered impaired, and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired and/or restructured. For loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management’s estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio. An allowance for loan losses is not maintained on loans designated as held for sale.
A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and/or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for commercial and construction loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral-dependent.
Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. Accordingly, the Company does not separately identify individual consumer and home equity loans for impairment disclosures, unless such loans are the subject of a restructuring agreement or there is a possible loss expected.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the provision for loan losses was $2.5 million, compared to $605 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross loans, excluding PPP loans, grew $76.3 million, or 7.5%, in 2020 over 2019. There were no charge-offs in 2020 or 2019. There were recoveries of $28 thousand and $5 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The provision for loan losses is a function of the allowance for loan loss methodology that the Bank uses to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for inherent loan losses after net charge-offs have been deducted. During the year ending December 31, 2020, the Bank adjusted the economic risk factor and loan modifications risk factor methodologies to incorporate the current economic implications, unemployment rate and amount of loan modifications due to the COVID-19 pandemic. See further discussion following in the “Credit Risk and Loan Quality” section of the Bank’s considerations of its December 31, 2020 allowance for loan loss levels. The allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2020 was $10.6 million representing 0.97% of outstanding loans receivable (not including PPP loans), as compared to $8.0 million as of December 31, 2019, representing 0.79% of outstanding loans receivable. Based principally on economic conditions, asset quality, and loan-loss experience, including that of comparable institutions in the Bank’s market area, the allowance is believed to be adequate to absorb any losses inherent in the portfolio. Because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate, or that material increases will not be necessary should the quality of the loans deteriorate. The Bank has not participated in any sub-prime lending activity.
Non-interest Income
Non-interest income is derived from the Company’s operations and represents primarily credit card processing fees, debit card interchange fees, service fees on deposit and loan relationships and income from bank owned life insurance. Non-interest income also may include net gains and losses from the sale of available for sale securities, loans, and other real estate owned.
Total non-interest income was $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is attributable to an increase in bank owned life insurance of $239 thousand, the gain on the sale of securities of $128 thousand, and the gain on the sale of loans of $59 thousand; offset by a decrease of $75 thousand in merchant processing and credit card processing fees due, in part, to less merchant
Embassy Bancorp, Inc.
processing activity resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and less credit card activity due to the credit card portfolio being sold in the second quarter of 2020, a decrease in other service fees of $89 thousand in part due to the Company waiving overdraft fees during part of the second quarter due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the gain on the sale of real estate owned of $45 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in the bank owned life insurance was driven by the effect market conditions had on underlying life insurance assets, particularly the separate account life insurance assets as well as the purchase of $4.0 million in bank owned life insurance in 2020. As the deposit customer account base continues to grow and the Company continues to mature and develop additional sources of fee income, non-interest income is expected to become a more significant contributor to the overall profitability of the Company. Currently, and unlike many in the industry, the Company does not derive additional non-interest fee income by selling its mortgages in the secondary market, nor does it offer trust or investment/brokerage services to its customers.
Non-interest Expense
Non-interest expenses represent the normal operating expenses of the Company. These expenses include salaries, employee benefits, occupancy, equipment, data processing, advertising and other expenses related to the overall operation of the Company.
Non-interest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $22.1 million, compared to $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in non-interest expenses is primarily due to an increase of $634 thousand, or 6.1%, over 2019, in salaries and employee benefits primarily due to the number of employees, the annual increases in salaries and benefits, increase in health insurance cost, and increase in non-qualified pension expense; offset by an increase in deferred compensation costs primarily associated with PPP loan originations. At December 31, 2020, the Company had ninety-six (96) full-time equivalent employees compared to ninety-five (95) at December 31, 2019. Additional increases in non-interest expenses are attributable to an increase of $246 thousand, or 10.5%, in data processing due primarily to e-commerce and the expanding customer base, an increase of $56 thousand, or 7.1%, in professional fees primarily due to an increase in auditing and legal costs, and an increase of $190 thousand, or 95.5%, in FDIC insurance premiums primarily due to FDIC assessment credits of $206 thousand applied in 2019 compared to credits of $44 thousand applied in 2020. These increases in non-interest expenses were offset by a decrease of $77 thousand, or 2.3%, in occupancy and equipment due, in part, to fewer leasehold improvements and utility expenses, a decrease of $617 thousand, or 36.0%, in advertising and promotions from shifts in marketing strategies and less promotional items resulting in part from the COVID-19 pandemic, and a decrease of $80 thousand, or 4.8%, in other expenses in part due to less postage expenses, less fraud losses, and less employee, customer, and shareholder expenses primarily due to restrictions from the COVID-19 pandemic.
A breakdown of other non-interest expenses is included in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes was $2.9 million and $2.5 million for December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The effective rate on income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 18.6%, respectively.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
Securities
The Company’s securities portfolio is classified, in its entirety, as “available for sale.” Management believes that a portfolio classification of available for sale allows complete flexibility in the management of the investment portfolio. Using this classification, the Company intends to hold these securities for an indefinite amount of time, but not necessarily to maturity. Such securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. The portfolio is structured to provide maximum return on investments while providing a consistent source of liquidity and meeting strict risk standards. The Company holds no high-risk, non-investment grade, securities or derivatives as of December 31, 2020.
The Company’s securities portfolio was $130.9 million at December 31, 2020, a $40.1 million increase from securities of $90.8 million at December 31, 2019. The Company’s securities have increased primarily due to purchases in the amount of $144.7 million and an increase in unrealized gains of $2.0 million, offset by a combination of investment principal pay-downs, maturities, calls, and proceeds from sales totaling $106.3 million. The carrying value of the securities portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, includes a net unrealized gain of $3.7 million and $1.7 million, respectively, which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity. This increase in the unrealized gain is due primarily to changes in market conditions from 2019 to 2020. No securities are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired.
The following table sets forth the composition of the securities portfolio at fair value as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.

The following table presents the maturities and average weighted yields of the debt securities portfolio as of December 31, 2020. Maturities of mortgage-backed securities are based on estimated life. Yields are based on amortized cost.
Securities by Maturities
Loans
On May 1, 2020, the Company sold its entire $689 thousand commercial credit card loan portfolio to an unrelated third party for a gain of $59 thousand. These commercial credit cards were unsecured. The Company does not anticipate retaining a credit card loan portfolio by originating and selling commercial credits cards in the future, but will continue to utilize the third party vendor to offer the product.
The loan portfolio comprises a major component of the Bank’s earning assets. All of the Bank’s loans are to domestic borrowers. Total net loans receivable (not including PPP loans) at December 31, 2020 increased $73.2 million to $1.08 billion from $1.01 billion December 31, 2019. The gross loan-to-deposit ratio (not including PPP loans) decreased from 98% at December 31, 2019 to 88% at December 31, 2020. The Bank’s loan portfolio at December 31, 2020, was comprised of residential real estate and consumer loans of $577.1 million, an increase of $58.1 million from December 31, 2019, and commercial loans of $512.5 million, an increase of $18.2 million from December 31, 2019. The Bank has not originated, nor does it intend to originate, sub-prime mortgage loans. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Bank is participating in the SBA PPP program to support the needs of its small business clients. PPP loans receivable at December 31, 2020 were $54.3 million. Including PPP loans receivable, the gross loan-to-deposit ratio was 93%.
Payment accommodations related to COVID-19 assistance were in the form of short-term (six months or less) principal and/or interest deferrals and the loans were considered current at the time of the accommodation. These payment accommodations were done in accordance with Section 4013 of the CARES Act and the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus and the Company did not categorize these modifications as troubled debt restructurings. Through December 31, 2020, the Company had provided payment accommodations on two hundred fifty-five (255) loans with balances of $151.3 million. Included in these totals are two hundred forty-three (243) loans totaling $133.0 million in which the payment accommodation period has ended and the loan payments have resumed under their original contractual terms. Also included in the totals above are six (6) loans totaling $984 thousand that are in their first short-term payment accommodation period, one (1) loan totaling $25 thousand that is in its second short-term payment accommodation period and five (5) loans totaling $17.3 million that are in their third short-term payment accommodation period. At December 31, 2020, Management has not changed its classification of these loans due to the quality knowledge our loan officers have obtained from their discussions with the borrowers and due to the strength of the collateral and guarantors. Management continues to carefully monitor those borrowers who remain on payment deferral for additional signs of distress that would result in a downgrade in loan classification. All loans under a modification period are considered current for payment status. All loans that have the CARES Act Section
Embassy Bancorp, Inc.
4013 modification, regardless of whether original contractual payment terms have resumed, are provided additional qualitative reserve in the Company’s allowance for loan loss calculation. None of the loans that remain in payment accommodation status at December 31, 2020 are considered impaired by Management at December 31, 2020 as, at this time, Management does not feel it probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
The following table sets forth information on the composition of the loan portfolio by type at December 31, 2020. All of the Company’s loans are to domestic borrowers.

The following table shows the maturities of the commercial loan portfolio and the loans subject to interest rate fluctuations at December 31, 2020.
Credit Risk and Loan Quality
The allowance for loan losses increased $2.5 million to $10.6 million at December 31, 2020 from $8.0 million at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the allowance for loan losses represented 0.97% and 0.79%, respectively, of total loans (not including PPP loans which are guaranteed by the SBA). In 2020, the Bank adjusted the economic risk factor and loan modifications risk factor methodologies to incorporate the current economic implications, unemployment rate and amount of loan modifications due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to the increase in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans. In determining its allowance for loan loss level for the year ending December 31, 2020, the Bank considered the health and composition of its loan portfolio going into and during the COVID-19 pandemic. At December 31, 2020, approximately 94% of the Bank’s loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate. Less than 6% of the Bank’s loan portfolio is to borrowers in the more particularly hard-hit industries (including the travel and hotel industry, the full-service and limited-service restaurant industries, and the assisted living facilities industry) and the Bank has no direct international exposure. The Bank was not required to adopt the Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) FASB accounting standard in 2020, as this guidance will not be effective for the Bank until 2023. Based upon current economic conditions, the composition of the loan portfolio, the perceived credit risk in the portfolio and loan-loss experience of the Bank and comparable institutions in the Bank’s market area, management feels the allowance is adequate to absorb reasonably anticipated losses.
At December 31, 2020, aggregate balances on non-performing loans (not including PPP loans) equaled $2.8 million compared to $2.7 million at December 31, 2019, representing 0.26% of total loans (not including PPP loans) at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. In certain circumstances in which the Company has deemed it prudent for reasons related to a borrower’s financial condition, the Company has agreed to restructure certain loans (referred to as troubled debt restructurings). Troubled debt restructuring loans, which are considered non-performing loans, outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019 totaled $2.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively. Generally, a loan is classified as nonaccrual when it is determined that the collection of all or a portion of interest or principal is doubtful or when a default of interest or principal has existed for 90 days or more, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. A non-performing loan may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured. Non-accrual loans outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 totaled $274 thousand and $18 thousand, respectively. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had no recorded investment in consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate property that is in the process of foreclosure. The Bank had no charge-offs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had no foreclosed assets. The details for the non-performing loans and assets are included in the following table:
Allowance for Loan Losses
Based upon current economic conditions, the composition of the loan portfolio and loan loss experience of comparable institutions in the Company’s market areas, an allowance for loan losses has been provided at 0.97% of outstanding loans receivable (excluding PPP loans). Based on its knowledge of the portfolio and current economic conditions, management believes that, as of December 31, 2020, the allowance is adequate to absorb reasonably anticipated losses. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $3.6 million of impaired loans (defined as a loan that management feels probable the Company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or loans considered to be troubled debt restructurings) compared to $3.5 million at December 31, 2019. Most of the Company’s impaired loans required no specific reserves due to adequate collateral. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had impaired loans of $1.5 million requiring a specific reserve of $169 thousand. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had impaired loans of $1.1 million requiring a specific reserve of $202 thousand.

Allocation of the Allowance for Loan Losses
The following table details the allocation of the allowance for loan losses to various loan categories (excluding PPP loans) and the related percent of total loans in each category. While allocations have been established for particular loan categories, management considers the entire allowance to be available to absorb losses in any category.

Deposits
As growth continues, the Company expects that the principal sources of its funds will be deposits, consisting of demand deposits, NOW accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts, and certificates of deposit from the local market areas surrounding the Company’s offices. These accounts provide the Company with a source of fee income and a relatively stable source of funds.
Total deposits at December 31, 2020 were $1.2 billion, an increase of $200.4 million, or 19.4%, over total deposits of $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2019. The growth in total deposits was due to organic growth of new and existing customers. Management believes the increase in deposits was from expansion of the Company’s online banking platform, competitive offered rates, the addition of a permanent branch office in Macungie, the continued convenience and efficiency of our branch network and branch personnel, along with an injection of federal stimulus money into the economy in 2020 from PPP funds and consumer stimulus payments and changing consumer and commercial spending as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The shift in time deposits was primarily due to prior year time deposit promotions rolling off and current time deposits yielding lower rates in the current rate environment. The funds were primarily used to fund new loan growth and purchase securities. The following table reflects the Company’s deposits by category for the periods indicated. All deposits are domestic deposits.
The following table sets forth the average balance of the Company’s deposits and the average rates paid on those deposits:

As a FDIC member institution, the Company’s deposits are insured to a maximum of $250,000 per depositor through the DIF that is administered by the FDIC and each institution is required to pay quarterly deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC.
Liquidity
Liquidity is a measure of the Company’s ability to meet the demands required for the funding of loans and to meet depositors’ requirements for use of their funds. The Company’s sources of liquidity are cash balances, due from banks, and federal funds sold. Cash and cash equivalents were $131.9 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $40.0 million at December 31, 2019. There are other sources of liquidity that are available to the Company, as well, including those described below.
Additional asset liquidity sources include principal and interest payments from the investment security, unpledged investment securities, and loan portfolios. Long-term liquidity needs may be met by selling unpledged securities available for sale, selling or participating loans, or raising additional capital. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $130.9 million of available for sale securities, compared to $90.8 million at December 31, 2019. Securities with carrying values of approximately $98.7 million and $74.0 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, were pledged as collateral to secure securities sold under agreements to repurchase, public deposits, and for other purposes required or permitted by law.
At December 31, 2020, the Bank had a maximum borrowing capacity for short-term and long-term advances of approximately $682.6 million. This borrowing capacity with the FHLB includes a line of credit of $150.0 million. There were no short-term FHLB advances outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and $18.1 million in short-term FHLB advances outstanding as of December 31, 2019. There were $14.7 million in long-term FHLB advances outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and none outstanding at December 31, 2019. All FHLB borrowings are secured by qualifying assets of the Bank.
The Bank has a federal funds line of credit with the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank (“ACBB”) of $10.0 million, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Advances from this line are unsecured.
As described in Note 2, the Bank has long-term PPPLF borrowings through the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia of $50.8 million, at an interest rate of 0.35%, as of December 31, 2020 and none as of December 31, 2019. All PPPLF borrowings are secured by PPP loans. As of February 3, 2021, the PPPLF borrowings have been repaid in full.
Because of the composition of the Company’s balance sheet, its strong capital base, deposit growth, and borrowing capacity, the Company believes that it remains well positioned with respect to liquidity. While it is desirable to be liquid, it has the effect of a lower interest margin. The majority of the Company’s funds are invested in loans; however, a portion is invested in investment securities that generally carry a lower yield.

Contractual Obligations
The following table represents the Company’s contractual obligations to make future payments as of the year ended December 31, 2020:
As of February 3, 2021, the PPPLF borrowings have been paid off in full.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company’s consolidated financial statements do not reflect various off-balance sheet arrangements that are made in the normal course of business, which may involve some liquidity risk. These commitments consist of unfunded loans, lines of credit, and letters of credit made under the same standards as on-balance sheet loan instruments. These off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 totaled $140.8 million and $142.4 million, respectively. Because these instruments have fixed maturity dates, and because many of them will expire without being drawn upon, they do not generally present any significant liquidity risk to the Company. The Bank also issued standby letters of credit commitments for the benefit of a third party, which secure public deposits in the Bank through the FHLB. These deposit letters of credit are secured by qualifying assets of the Bank. The Company, through the Bank, had $7.6 million of FHLB deposit letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and none as of December 31, 2020. For further information see Note 5.
Management believes that any amounts actually drawn upon can be funded in the normal course of operations. The Company has no investment in or financial relationship with any unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on liquidity or the availability of capital resources. Management will continue to evaluate the Company’s liquidity position for changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Capital Resources and Adequacy
Total stockholders’ equity was $112.2 million as of December 31, 2020, representing a net increase of $12.6 million from December 31, 2019. The increase in capital was primarily the result of the net income of $12.8 million, an increase of $1.6 million in unrealized gains on available for sale securities, and an increase in surplus of $468 thousand due to stock grants, stock options, and employee stock purchases with compensation expense, offset by dividends paid of $1.6 million and treasury stock repurchases of $765 thousand.
The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by banking regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements.
The regulations require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk weighted assets (as defined), and Tier 1 capital to average assets (as defined). As of December 31, 2020, the Bank met the minimum requirements. In addition, the Bank’s capital ratios exceeded the amounts required to be considered “well capitalized” as defined in the regulations.
‎
Embassy Bancorp, Inc.
The following table provides a comparison of the Bank’s risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios:
In July 2013, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve approved a new rule that substantially amended the regulatory risk based capital rules applicable to the Bank and the Company. The final rule implements the “Basel III” regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.
In addition to the risk-based capital guidelines, the federal banking regulators established minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) guidelines for bank holding companies. These guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of 3% for those bank holding companies which have the highest regulatory examination ratings and are not contemplating or experiencing significant growth or expansion. All other bank holding companies are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4%.
The capital ratios to be considered “well capitalized” under the new capital rules are: common equity of 6.5%, Tier 1 leverage of 5%, Tier 1 risk-based capital of 8%, and Total Risk-Based capital of 10%.
The Company qualifies as a small bank holding company and is not subject to the Federal Reserve’s consolidated capital rules, although an institution that so qualifies may continue to file reports that include such capital amounts and ratios. The Company has elected to continue to report those amounts and ratios.

Interest Rate Risk Management
A principal objective of the Company’s asset/liability management policy is to minimize the Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates by an ongoing review of the maturity and repricing of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO), which meets as part of the Board of Directors meeting, oversees this review, which establishes policies to control interest rate sensitivity. Interest rate sensitivity is the volatility of a company’s earnings resulting from a movement in market interest rates. The Company monitors rate sensitivity in order to reduce vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations while maintaining adequate capital levels and acceptable levels of liquidity. The Company’s asset/liability management policy, monthly and quarterly financial reports, along with simulation modeling, supplies management with guidelines to evaluate and manage rate sensitivity.

GAP, a measure of the difference in volume between interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities, is a means of monitoring the sensitivity of a financial institution to changes in interest rates. The chart below provides an indicator of the rate sensitivity of the Company. NOW and savings accounts are categorized by their respective estimated decay rates. The Company is liability sensitive, which means that if interest rates fall, interest income will fall slower than interest expense and net interest income will likely increase. If interest rates rise, interest income will rise slower than interest expense and net interest income will likely decrease. The Company continues to monitor interest rate exposure of its interest bearing assets and liabilities and believes that it is well positioned for any future market rate adjustments.

Based on a twelve-month forecast of the balance sheet, the following table sets forth our interest rate risk profile at December 31, 2020. For income simulation purposes, personal and business savings accounts reprice every three months, personal and business NOW accounts reprice every four months and personal and business money market accounts reprice every two months. The impact on net interest income, illustrated in the following table, would vary if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from that indicated by the assumptions.
Return on Assets and Equity
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the return on average assets was 0.98%, the return on average equity was 12.07%, and the ratio of average shareholders’ equity to average total assets was 8.13%.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the return on average assets was 0.95%, the return on average equity was 11.54%, and the ratio of average shareholders’ equity to average total assets was 8.28%.
Dividend Payout Ratio
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 the dividend payout ratio was 12.83% and 13.74%, respectively.
Effects of Inflation
The majority of assets and liabilities of the Company are monetary in nature, and therefore, differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories. The precise impact of inflation upon the Company is difficult to measure. Inflation may affect the borrowing needs of consumers, thereby impacting the growth rate of the Company’s assets. Inflation may also affect the general level of interest rates, which can have a direct bearing on the Company.
