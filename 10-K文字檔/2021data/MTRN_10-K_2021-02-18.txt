Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
We are an integrated producer of high-performance advanced engineered materials used in a variety of electrical, electronic, thermal, and structural applications. Our products are sold into numerous end markets, including semiconductor, industrial, aerospace and defense, automotive, energy, consumer electronics, and telecom and data center.
Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update
The significant macroeconomic impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic impacted several of our markets beginning in the first quarter of 2020 primarily in the form of reduced demand, particularly in the consumer electronics, automotive, energy, aerospace and defense, and industrial end markets. During 2020, we recorded additional reserves for slow-moving and excess inventory of approximately $1.3 million related to the collapse in demand in the oil and gas industry. We also reviewed for any other potential impairment indicators and did not identify any. We still may temporarily shut down our facilities in response to reduced demand, due to employees being impacted by COVID-19, or changes in government policy. We are not experiencing any significant supply chain disruptions. We expect reduced demand to continue at least through the first quarter of 2021, but the extent and timing cannot be reasonably estimated due to the evolving nature of this pandemic.
In 2020, the Company incurred $4.1 million of expense primarily related to premium pay for production workers who were deemed essential to work onsite during the pandemic, as well as for personal protective equipment and temperature-checking services.
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve, and, therefore, we cannot predict the extent to which our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows will ultimately be impacted.
The Company suspended its share buyback program in the first quarter of 2020. The Company subsequently decided to lift the suspension of its share buyback program in the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition, the Company has evaluated the impact of the CARES Act and has determined it does not have a material impact to its consolidated financial statements. See Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.
From a liquidity perspective, we believe we are well positioned to manage through this global crisis. In order to ensure we have more than adequate liquidity, we borrowed $150.0 million under the revolving credit facility in April 2020, $116.0 million of which was repaid during the second half of 2020. We ended 2020 with total cash of $25.9 million and $38.5 million of total debt, or in a net debt position of $12.6 million. In addition, we had $245.8 million of available borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2020.
Additionally, in July 2020, we completed the acquisition of Optics Balzers for a purchase price of $136.1 million, including the assumption of debt. The transaction was funded with cash on hand, including a portion of the $150.0 million borrowed under our revolving credit facility during the second quarter of 2020.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
During the fourth quarter of 2020, we elected to change our method for valuing inventories that previously used the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method to the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Total inventories accounted for under the LIFO method represented approximately 45% of the Company's total inventories as of December 31, 2019 prior to this change in method. We determined that the FIFO method is preferable as it results in uniformity across materially all of our global operations, more closely resembles the physical flow of our inventory, and improves comparability with our peers. The effects of the change in accounting principle have been retrospectively applied to all periods presented in Item 7. Refer to “Note A - Significant Accounting Policies” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
2020 Compared to 2019
Net sales of $1,176.3 million in 2020 decreased $9.1 million from $1,185.4 million in 2019. Increased net sales of $97.1 million in our Advanced Materials segment were more than offset by decreased net sales of $106.0 million and $0.2 million in our Performance Alloys and Composites and Precision Optics segments, respectively, driven by lower sales volumes. The change in precious metal and copper prices favorably impacted net sales during 2020 by $94.6 million.
Value-added sales is a non-GAAP financial measure that removes the impact of pass-through metal costs and allows for analysis without the distortion of the movement or volatility in metal prices and changes in mix due to customer-supplied material. Internally, we manage our business on this basis, and a reconciliation of net sales, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to value-added sales is included herein. Value-added sales of $678.6 million in 2020 were down 8% compared to 2019. The increase in semiconductor end market value-added sales was more than offset by the decrease in value-added sales due to reduced demand in the aerospace and defense, energy, telecom and data center, and industrial end markets.
Gross margin was $192.6 million in 2020, or a 27% decrease from the $262.7 million gross margin recorded in 2019. Gross margin expressed as a percentage of value-added sales decreased to 28% in 2020 from 36% in 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes, as well as $12.9 million of mine development costs relating to a recent mine expansion, $3.8 million of costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and a $1.3 million charge to reserves for slow-moving and excess inventory related to the collapse in demand in the oil and gas industry, all of which were recorded in 2020.
SG&A expense totaled $134.0 million in 2020 as compared to $147.2 million in 2019. The decrease in SG&A expense for 2020 was primarily driven by lower variable compensation expense and cost management actions, partially offset by integration and transaction costs related to the Optics Balzers acquisition. Expressed as a percentage of value-added sales, SG&A expense was 20% in both 2020 and 2019.
R&D expense consists primarily of direct personnel costs for pre-production evaluation and testing of new products, prototypes, and applications. R&D expense was $20.3 million, an increase of 11% compared to 2019 and increased to 3% as a percentage of value-added sales in 2020. The increase in R&D expense reflects additional investment in new product and application development.
Goodwill and Asset impairment charges includes non-recurring charges relating to goodwill and other assets in our Precision Optics segment. Refer to Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.
Restructuring expense consists primarily of cost reduction actions taken in order to improve the efficiency of our operations. In 2020, we recorded $11.2 million of restructuring charges. Of this amount, $8.8 million relates to the closure of our Warren, Michigan and Fremont, California facilities in our Performance Alloys and Composites segment and $1.7 million relates to the closure of our Large Area Coatings (LAC) business in our Precision Optics segment.
In 2019, we recorded $0.8 million of expenses related to restructuring actions taken in our LAC business and our Other segment. Refer to Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.
Other-net totaled expense of $8.5 million and $11.8 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in Other-net was primarily driven by a $3.3 million foreign exchange hedge gain realized in 2020. Refer to Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the major components within Other-net.
Other non-operating (income) expense-net includes components of pension and post-retirement expense other than service costs. In 2019, other non-operating (income) expense-net included a non-cash pre-tax pension curtailment charge of $3.3 million associated with the pension plan amendment to freeze the pay and service amounts used to calculate pension benefits effective January 1, 2020. Refer to Note P of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of net periodic benefit costs.
Interest expense - net was $3.9 million in 2020 and $1.6 million in 2019. The increase in interest expense in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily due to increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
Income tax (benefit) expense for 2020 was a benefit of $7.2 million compared to $12.1 million of expense in 2019. The effects of percentage depletion, the research and development credit, and the release of a valuation allowance in a foreign jurisdiction were the primary factors for the difference between the effective and statutory tax rates in 2020. Refer to Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on income taxes.
See the Management Discussion and Analysis section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for a discussion of our results for 2019 compared to 2018.
Segment Disclosures
The Company consists of four reportable segments: Performance Alloys and Composites, Advanced Materials, Precision Optics, and Other. The Other reportable segment includes unallocated corporate costs.
Performance Alloys and Composites
2020 Compared to 2019
Net sales from the Performance Alloys and Composites segment of $394.2 million in 2020 decreased 21% compared to 2019. The decrease was due to reduced sales into all major end markets, with the largest declines in the aerospace and defense, energy, telecom and data center, and industrial end markets.
Value-added sales of $345.3 million in 2020 were 19% lower than value-added sales of $428.1 million in 2019. The decrease in value-added sales was due to the same factors driving the decrease in net sales.
Performance Alloys and Composites generated operating profit of $13.6 million, or 4% of value-added sales, in 2020 as compared to $73.8 million, or 17% of value-added sales, in 2019. The decrease in operating profit was primarily due to reduced sales volumes, as well as $12.9 million of mine development costs recorded in 2020. In addition, restructuring charges of $8.8 million were recorded in 2020 related to the closure of our Warren, Michigan and Fremont, California facilities.
Advanced Materials
2020 Compared to 2019
Net sales from the Advanced Materials segment of $670.9 million in 2020 were 17% higher than net sales of $573.8 million in 2019. The increase in net sales was primarily due to the impact of higher pass-through metal prices of $92.6 million.
Value-added sales of $234.0 million increased $9.7 million compared to value-added sales of $224.3 million in 2019 primarily due to increased value-added sales into the semiconductor end market, partially offset by reduced value-added sales into the energy and other end markets.
Advanced Materials generated operating profit of $22.1 million in 2020, compared to $25.1 million in 2019. Decreased operating profit in 2020, compared to 2019, was the result of unfavorable sales mix and reduced manufacturing yields.
Precision Optics
2020 Compared to 2019
Net sales from the Precision Optics segment of $111.2 million in 2020 decreased slightly compared to net sales of $111.5 million in 2019 primarily due to reduced sales volumes related to blood glucose test strip and projection display products and a lower mix of precious metal containing products, largely offset by an increase from sales attributable to our Optics Balzers acquisition.
Value-added sales of $101.9 million in 2020 increased 17% compared to value-added sales of $87.3 million in 2019. The increase was driven by our Optics Balzers acquisition, which was partially offset by reduced value-added sales related to blood glucose test strip and projection display products.
The Precision Optics segment generated operating losses of $4.4 million and $3.6 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The 2020 operating loss includes impairment charges of $10.5 million and restructuring charges of $2.1 million primarily related to the closure of our LAC business. The 2019 operating loss included impairment charges of $14.1 million related to our LAC business.
Other
2020 Compared to 2019
The Other reportable segment in total includes unallocated corporate costs.
Corporate costs of $23.1 million in 2020 decreased $1.7 million as compared to $24.8 million in 2019. Corporate costs were 3% of total Company value-added sales in both 2020 and 2019. The decrease in corporate costs in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily related to lower variable compensation expense and cost management actions, partially offset by transaction costs related to the Optics Balzers acquisition.
Value-Added Sales - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure
A reconciliation of net sales to value-added sales, a non-GAAP financial measure, for each reportable segment and for the Company in total for 2020, 2019, and 2018 is as follows:
The cost of gold, silver, platinum, palladium, and copper can be quite volatile. Our pricing policy is to directly pass the cost of these metals on to the customer in order to mitigate the impact of metal price volatility on our results from operations. Trends and comparisons of net sales are affected by movements in the market prices of these metals, but changes in net sales due to metal price movements may not have a proportionate impact on our profitability.
Internally, management reviews net sales on a value-added basis. Value-added sales is a non-GAAP financial measure that deducts the value of the pass-through metal costs from net sales. Value-added sales allow management to assess the impact of differences in net sales between periods, segments, or markets, and analyze the resulting margins and profitability without the distortion of movements in pass-through metal costs. The dollar amount of gross margin and operating profit is not affected by the value-added sales calculation. We sell other metals and materials that are not considered direct pass-throughs, and these costs are not deducted from net sales when calculating value-added sales.
Our net sales are also affected by changes in the use of customer-supplied metal. When we manufacture a precious metal product, the customer may purchase metal from us or may elect to provide its own metal, in which case we process the metal on a toll basis, and the metal value does not flow through net sales or cost of sales. In either case, we generally earn our margin based upon our fabrication efforts. The relationship of this margin to net sales can change depending upon whether or not the product was made from our metal or the customer’s metal. The use of value-added sales removes the potential distortion in the comparison of net sales caused by changes in the level of customer-supplied metal.
By presenting information on net sales and value-added sales, it is our intention to allow users of our financial statements to review our net sales with and without the impact of the pass-through metals.
FINANCIAL POSITION
Cash Flow
A summary of cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities is as follows:
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $101.1 million in 2020 versus $99.2 million in 2019. Increased operating cash flow from customer prepayments of $49.4 million in 2020 was partially offset by $37.9 million of decreased net income. Working capital requirements used cash of $23.9 million during 2020 compared to using $22.0 million in 2019. Cash flows used in accounts receivable decreased $23.2 million. Three-month trailing days sales outstanding (DSO) was approximately 41 days at December 31, 2020 versus 47 days at December 31, 2019. Cash flows used for inventory were $1.3 million in 2020, compared to providing $20.5 million of cash in the prior year primarily in our Performance Alloys and Composites and Advanced Materials segments. Cash flows used for accounts payable and accrued expenses were $21.9 million compared to the prior-year use of cash of $18.6 million due to incentive compensation payouts. Price movements of precious and base metals are passed through to customers. Therefore, while sudden movements in the price of metals can cause a temporary imbalance in our cash receipts and payments in either direction, once prices stabilize, our cash flow tends to stabilize as well.
Net cash used in investing activities was $194.7 million in 2020 compared to $26.5 million in 2019 due to a $130.7 million payment, net of cash acquired, for the Optics Balzers acquisition. In addition, capital expenditures increased $43.0 million in 2020, compared to 2019, due to investments in new equipment funded by customer prepayments. See Notes B and L to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.
Net cash used in financing activities decreased $11.0 million from 2019 primarily due to net borrowings of $34.0 million under our revolving credit facility in 2020, partially offset by the paydown of $20.6 million of long-term debt, most of which was assumed in the Optics Balzers acquisition.
Dividends per common share increased 5% to $0.455 per share in 2020. Total dividend payments to common shareholders were $9.3 million in 2020 and $8.9 million in 2019. In May 2020, the Board of Directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.11 to $0.115 per share. We intend to pay a quarterly dividend on an ongoing basis, subject to a continuing strong capital structure and a determination that the dividend remains in the best interest of our shareholders.
Liquidity
We believe that cash flow from operations plus the available borrowing capacity and our current cash balance are adequate to support operating requirements, capital expenditures, projected pension plan contributions, the current dividend and share repurchase programs, environmental remediation projects, and strategic acquisitions. At December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign operations totaled $20.0 million. We do not expect restrictions on repatriation of cash held outside of the United States to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition, or the results of operations for the foreseeable future.
A summary of key data relative to our liquidity, including the outstanding debt, cash balances, and available borrowing capacity, as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 is as follows:
Net (debt) cash is a non-GAAP financial measure. We are providing this information because we believe it is more indicative of our overall financial position. It is also a measure our management uses to assess financing and other decisions. We believe that based on our typical cash flow generated from operations, we can support a higher leverage ratio in future periods.
The available borrowing capacity in the table above represents the additional amounts that could be borrowed under our revolving credit facility and other secured lines existing as of the end of each year depicted. The applicable debt covenants have been taken into account when determining the available borrowing capacity, including the covenant that restricts the borrowing capacity to a multiple of the twelve-month trailing earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and other adjustments.
In 2019, we amended and restated the agreement governing our $375.0 million revolving credit facility (Credit Agreement). The maturity date of the Credit Agreement was extended from 2020 to 2024, and the Credit Agreement provides more favorable interest rates under certain circumstances. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides the Company and its subsidiaries with additional capacity to enter into facilities for the consignment, borrowing, or leasing of precious metals and copper, and provides enhanced flexibility to finance acquisitions and other strategic initiatives. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its direct subsidiaries, with the exception of non-mining real property and certain other assets.
The Credit Agreement allows the Company to borrow money at a premium over LIBOR or prime rate and at varying maturities. The premium resets quarterly according to the terms and conditions available under the agreement. The Credit Agreement includes restrictive covenants relating to restrictions on additional indebtedness, acquisitions, dividends, and stock repurchases. In addition, the Credit Agreement includes covenants subject to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Cash on hand does not affect the covenants or the borrowing capacity under our debt agreements.
In July 2020, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the capital stock of Optics Balzers. The purchase price was approximately $136.1 million, including the assumption of debt. The transaction was funded with cash on hand, including a portion of the $150.0 million borrowed under our revolving credit facility in the second quarter of 2020.
Portions of our business utilize off-balance sheet consignment arrangements to finance metal requirements. Expansion of business volumes and/or higher metal prices can put pressure on the consignment line limitations from time to time. In 2019, we entered into a precious metals consignment agreement, maturing on August 27, 2022. The available and unused capacity under the metal financing lines totaled approximately $50.0 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $140.7 million as of December 31, 2019. The availability is determined by Board approved levels and actual line capacity.
In January 2014, our Board of Directors approved a plan to repurchase up to $50.0 million of our common stock. The timing of the share repurchases will depend on several factors, including market and business conditions, our cash flow, debt levels, and other investment opportunities. There is no minimum quantity requirement to repurchase our common stock for a given year, and the repurchases may be discontinued at any time. We repurchased 158,000 shares of our common stock for $6.8 million during 2020. Since the approval of the repurchase plan, we have purchased 1,254,264 shares at a total cost of $41.7 million, or an average of $33.23 per share.
Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:
(1) Refer to Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
(2) These amounts represent future interest payments related to our total debt, excluding any interest payments to be made on borrowings under our Credit Agreement.
(3) Refer to Note M to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
(4) The non-cancelable lease payments represent payments under operating leases with initial lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2020.
(5) Our domestic defined benefit pension plan is overfunded as of December 31, 2020. Contributions in future periods, if any, will be dependent upon regulatory requirements, the plan funded ratio, plan investment performance, discount rates, actuarial assumptions, plan amendments, our contribution objectives, and other factors. We anticipate funding those contributions with cash on hand, cash generated from operations, or borrowings under our existing lines of credit. It is not practical to estimate the required contributions beyond 2021 at the present time.
(6) Other long-term liabilities include environmental remediation costs. We have an active environmental compliance program. We estimate the probable cost of identified environmental remediation projects and establish reserves accordingly. The environmental remediation reserve balance was $5.5 million at December 31, 2020 and $5.9 million at December 31, 2019. Environmental projects tend to be long term, and the associated payments are typically made over a number of years. Refer to Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Off-balance Sheet Obligations
We maintain the majority of the precious metals and copper we use in production on a consignment basis in order to reduce our exposure to metal price movements and to reduce our working capital investment. Refer to
