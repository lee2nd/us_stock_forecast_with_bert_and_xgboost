Fiscal years 2020 and 2019 each consisted of 52 weeks. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. All amounts disclosed are in thousands except store counts, share and per share data and percentages.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements involving risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our results to differ materially from expectations. For a discussion of the risks facing our business, see “Item 1A - Risk Factors” included in this Annual Report.
COVID-19
The spread of COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, caused state and municipal public officials to mandate jurisdiction-wide curfews, including “shelter-in-place” and closures of most non-essential businesses as well as other measures to mitigate the spread of the virus.
The following summarizes the various measures we have implemented to effectively manage the business as well as the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic during the year ended January 30, 2021.
•
While we continued to serve our customers through our online e-commerce websites during the periods in which we were forced to shut down all of our domestic and international retail locations alongside other retailers, including our wholesale partners, the store closures resulted in a sharp decline in our revenue and ability to generate cash flows from operations. We began reopening stores during May 2020 and nearly all of the Company’s stores have since reopened in a limited
capacity in accordance with state and local regulations related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Other than Hawaii and the UK which re-closed for a short period and subsequently re-opened based on the local stay-at-home order, we have not been impacted by any re-closure orders or regulations.
As a result of store closures and the decline in projected cash flows, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge related to property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets to adjust the carrying amounts of certain store locations to their estimated fair value. During the year ended January 30, 2021, the Company recorded an impairment of property and equipment and operating lease ROU assets of $4,470 and $8,556, respectively. The impairment charges are recorded within Impairment of long-lived assets on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in this Annual Report. See Note 1 “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - (K) Impairment of Long-lived Assets” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional information.
The Company incurred a non-cash impairment charge of $13,848 on goodwill and intangible assets during the year ended January 30, 2021 as a result of the decline in long-term projections due to COVID-19. See Note 3 “Goodwill and Intangible Assets” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional information;
•
We entered into a loan agreement with Sun Capital Partners, Inc. who own approximately 72% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock (see Note 14 “Related Party Transactions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for further discussion regarding our relationship with Sun Capital), as well as amendments to our 2018 Term Loan Facility and our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility to provide additional liquidity and amend certain financial covenants to allow increased operational flexibility. See Note 5 “Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional information;
•
Furloughed all of our retail store associates as well as a significant portion of our corporate associates during the period of store closures and reinstated a limited number of associates commensurate to the store re-openings as well as other business needs;
•
Temporarily reduced retained employee salaries and suspended board retainer fees;
•
Engaged in active discussions with landlords to address the current operating environment, including amending existing lease terms. See Note 12 “Leases” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional information;
•
Executed other operational initiatives to carefully manage our investments across all key areas, including aligning inventory levels with anticipated demand and reevaluating non-critical capital build-out and other investments and activities; and
•
Streamlined our expense structure in all areas such as marketing, distribution, and product development to align with the business environment and sales opportunities.
The COVID-19 pandemic remains highly volatile and continues to evolve on a daily basis. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - “Risks Related to Our Business and Industry - The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, cash flow, liquidity and results of operations” for additional discussion regarding risks to our business associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Executive Overview
We are a global contemporary group, consisting of three brands: Vince, Rebecca Taylor and Parker. On November 3, 2019, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of Rebecca Taylor, Inc. and Parker Holding, LLC from CLG. See Note 2 “Business Combinations” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional information.
Vince, established in 2002, is a leading global luxury apparel and accessories brand best known for creating elevated yet understated pieces for every day effortless style. Known for its range of luxury products, Vince offers women’s and men’s ready-to-wear, footwear and accessories through 47 full-price retail stores, 15 outlet stores, its e-commerce site, vince.com and through its subscription service Vince Unfold, vinceunfold.com, as well as through premium wholesale channels globally.
Rebecca Taylor, founded in 1996 in New York City, is a contemporary womenswear line lauded for its signature prints, romantic detailing and vintage inspired aesthetic, reimagined for a modern era. The Rebecca Taylor collection is available at six full-price retail stores, three outlet stores, through its e-commerce site at rebeccataylor.com and through its subscription service Rebecca Taylor RNTD at rebeccataylorrntd.com, as well as through major department and specialty stores worldwide.
Parker, founded in 2008 in New York City, is a contemporary women’s fashion brand that is trend focused. While we continue to believe that the Parker brand complements our portfolio, during the first half of fiscal 2020 the Company decided to pause the
creation of new products to focus resources on the operations of the Vince and Rebecca Taylor brands and to preserve liquidity. The Parker collection was previously available through major department stores and specialty stores worldwide as well as through its e-commerce website.
We serve our customers through a variety of channels that reinforce our brand images. Our diversified channel strategy allows us to introduce our products to customers through multiple distribution points that are presented in three reportable segments: Vince Wholesale, Vince Direct-to-consumer and Rebecca Taylor and Parker.
Results of Operations
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales include our e-commerce sales in order to align with how we manage our brick-and-mortar retail stores and e-commerce online stores as a combined single direct-to-consumer channel of distribution. As a result of our omni-channel sales and inventory strategy, as well as cross-channel customer shopping patterns, there is less distinction between our brick-and-mortar retail stores and our e-commerce online stores and we believe the inclusion of e-commerce sales in our comparable sales metric is a more meaningful representation of these results and provides a more comprehensive view of our year over year comparable sales metric.
A store is included in the comparable sales calculation after it has completed 13 full fiscal months of operations and includes stores, if any, that have been remodeled or relocated within the same geographic market the Company served prior to the relocation. Non-comparable sales include new stores which have not completed 13 full fiscal months of operations, sales from closed stores, and relocated stores serving a new geographic market. For 53-week fiscal years, we continue to adjust comparable sales to exclude the additional week. There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable sales.
As a result of the extensive temporary store closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, comparable sales are not a meaningful metric for the year ended January 30, 2021 and we have not included a discussion within our Results of Operations.
Fiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019
The following table presents, for the periods indicated, our operating results as a percentage of net sales as well as earnings (loss) per share data:
(*) Not meaningful
Net sales for fiscal 2020 were $219,870, decreasing $155,317, or 41.4%, versus $375,187 for fiscal 2019.
Gross profit decreased $89,833, or 50.3%, to $88,597 in fiscal 2020 from $178,430 in fiscal 2019. As a percentage of sales, gross margin was 40.3%, compared with 47.6% in the prior year. The total gross margin rate decrease was primarily driven by the following factors:
•
The unfavorable impact of increased promotional activity contributed negatively by approximately 550 basis points;
•
The unfavorable impact of year-over-year adjustments to inventory reserves contributed negatively by approximately 160 basis points; and
•
The unfavorable impact of deleveraging of supply chain costs contributed negatively by approximately 150 basis points; which was offset by
•
The favorable impact from a decrease in sales allowances contributed positively by approximately 200 basis points.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for the year ended January 30, 2021 was $13,848 which includes the impairment of $9,462 related to goodwill and $4,386 related to indefinite-lived tradenames. Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for the year ended February 1, 2020 was $19,491 which includes the impairment of $2,129 related to goodwill, $11,247 related to indefinite-lived tradenames, and $6,115 related to definite-lived customer lists, all related to the Rebecca Taylor and Parker segment.
Impairment of long-lived assets for the year ended January 30, 2021 was $13,026 which includes the impairment of $4,470 related to property and equipment and $8,556 related to operating lease ROU assets. Impairment of long-lived assets for the year ended February 1, 2020 was $818 which includes the impairment of $641 related to property and equipment and $177 related to operating lease ROU assets.
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for fiscal 2020 were $122,803, decreasing $55,708, or 31.2%, versus $178,511 for fiscal 2019. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales were 55.9% and 47.6% for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively. The change in SG&A expenses compared to the prior year period was primarily due to:
•
$28,176 of decreased compensation and benefits, primarily due to the actions taken in response to COVID-19 including the impact of furloughing our retail store associates as well as a significant portion of our corporate associates, temporarily reducing retained employee salaries, lower bonus expense, reduced share-based compensation expense and reduced headcount;
•
$6,761 of decreased travel and entertainment, consulting and other third-party costs as a result of our streamlined expense structure in response to COVID-19;
•
$5,959 of decreased marketing and advertising costs as a result of streamlining our expense structure in response to COVID-19;
•
$5,613 of decreased rent and occupancy expense as a result of rent abatements, rent deferrals, rent reductions and other concessions, resulting from negotiations with landlords;
•
$3,571 of decreased transaction related expenses as a result of the acquisitions of Rebecca Taylor, Inc. and Parker Holding, LLC in the prior year; and
•
$2,652 of decreased product development costs.
The above decreases were partially offset by:
•
$2,222 of increased bad debt expense related to the risk associated with our ability to collect outstanding receivables from our customers as a result of COVID-19.
Interest expense, net increased $49, or 1.0%, to $5,007 in fiscal 2020 from $4,958 in fiscal 2019 primarily due to the composition of debt.
Other (income) expense, net was $(2,304) in fiscal 2020 and $(55,842) in fiscal 2019. The change was primarily attributable to a benefit from re-measurement of the liability related to the Tax Receivable Agreement (“TRA”). See “Critical Accounting Policies - Tax Receivable Agreement” below and Note 14 “Related Party Transactions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for further information.
Provision for income taxes for fiscal 2020 was $1,866 as compared to $98 for fiscal 2019. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 was (2.9)% and 0.3%, respectively. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the impact of the valuation allowance established against our deferred tax assets partly offset by state taxes. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the impact of pre-tax items with no corresponding tax impact, primarily the revaluation of the TRA liability as well as the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, partially offset by the impact of state taxes, and the impact of the valuation allowance established against our deferred tax asset.
Performance by Segment
The Company has identified three reportable segments as further described below:
•
Vince Wholesale segment-consists of the Company’s operations to distribute Vince brand products to major department stores and specialty stores in the United States and select international markets;
•
Vince Direct-to-consumer segment-consists of the Company’s operations to distribute Vince brand products directly to the consumer through its Vince branded full-price specialty retail stores, outlet stores, and e-commerce platform, and its subscription business Vince Unfold; and
•
Rebecca Taylor and Parker segment-consists of the Company’s operations to distribute Rebecca Taylor and Parker brand products to major department stores and specialty stores in the U.S. and select international markets, directly to the consumer through their own branded e-commerce platforms and Rebecca Taylor retail and outlet stores, and through its subscription business Rebecca Taylor RNTD.
Unallocated corporate expenses are related to the Vince brand and are comprised of SG&A expenses attributable to corporate and administrative activities (such as marketing, design, finance, information technology, legal and human resources departments), and other charges that are not directly attributable to the Company’s Vince Wholesale and Vince Direct-to-consumer reportable segments.
Vince Wholesale
Net sales from our Vince Wholesale segment decreased $61,068, or 36.6%, to $105,737 in fiscal 2020 from $166,805 in fiscal 2019, primarily due to the delay and cancellation of order receipts as a result of the temporary closure of our wholesale partner’s doors due to COVID-19 as well as lower off-price shipments.
Income from operations from our Vince Wholesale segment decreased $25,381, or 45.8%, to $30,059 in fiscal 2020 from $55,440 in fiscal 2019 primarily due to the aforementioned decrease in sales and the unfavorable impact of year-over-year adjustments to inventory and accounts receivable reserves, partly offset by reduced spending.
Vince Direct-to-consumer
Net sales from our Vince Direct-to-consumer segment decreased $47,086, or 35.3%, to $86,326 in fiscal 2020 from $133,412 in fiscal 2019. The decrease in sales was primarily due to the temporary store closures of our domestic and international retail locations due to COVID-19 and reduced traffic partly offset by growth of over 25% in e-commerce, which includes Vince Unfold. Since the end of fiscal 2019, our total retail store count remains unchanged, bringing our total retail store count to 62 consisting of 47 full price stores and 15 outlet stores as of January 30, 2021, compared to 62 (consisting of 48 full price stores and 14 outlet stores) as of February 1, 2020.
Our Vince Direct-to-consumer segment had a loss from operations of $20,734 in fiscal 2020 compared to income from operations of $10,127 in fiscal 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the aforementioned decrease in sales, as well as the
impairment of property and equipment and operating lease ROU assets, partly offset by reduced spending and lower rent and occupancy expense.
Rebecca Taylor and Parker
Net sales from our Rebecca Taylor and Parker segment decreased $47,163, or 62.9%, to $27,807 in fiscal 2020 from $74,970 in fiscal 2019 primarily due to a $38,506 decrease in wholesale sales and a $8,657 decrease in the direct-to-consumer channels primarily due to temporary store closures of our domestic retail locations alongside other retailers, including our wholesale partners, as well as due to our strategic initiatives to refresh the Rebecca Taylor brand and our pause in the development of new product for the Parker brand.
Loss from operations from our Rebecca Taylor and Parker segment decreased $12,450, or 43.6%, to $16,112 in fiscal 2020 from $28,562, in fiscal 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by the impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets recognized during fiscal 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, if any, borrowings available under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and our ability to access capital markets. Our primary cash needs are funding working capital requirements, meeting our debt service requirements and capital expenditures for new stores and related leasehold improvements. The most significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable and other current liabilities. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken various measures to improve our liquidity as described above (see “COVID-19”). Based on these measures and our current expectations, we believe that our sources of liquidity will generate sufficient cash flows to meet our obligations during the next twelve months from the date these financial statements are issued.
Amendments to Existing Credit Facilities
On June 8, 2020, Vince, LLC entered into the Third Amendment (the “Third Revolver Amendment”) to the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) and the Third Amendment (the “Third Term Loan Amendment”) to the 2018 Term Loan Credit Facility (as defined below). The Third Revolver Amendment, among others, temporarily increased availability under the facility’s borrowing base by increasing the aggregate commitments to $110,000 from $100,000 through November 30, 2020 and revises certain eligibility criteria of trade receivables to be included in the borrowing base during that period, as well as waived certain events of default. The Third Term Loan Amendment, among others, temporarily suspended the requirement to maintain a specified Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio through the delivery of a compliance certificate relating to the fiscal quarter ending July 31, 2021, and replaced it with a springing covenant, under which the obligation to maintain a specified Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 is triggered only when the excess availability under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility falls below $15,000, or for the period between September 6, 2020 and January 9, 2021, $10,000, and for the period between January 10, 2021 and January 31, 2021, $12,500. The Third Term Loan Amendment also revised the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio required to be maintained following the period of the covenant suspension such that the required ratio is now 1.50 to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter ending July 31, 2021 and 1.75 to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter thereafter, as well as waived certain events of default.
On December 11, 2020, Vince, LLC entered into the Fifth Amendment (the “Fifth Revolver Amendment”) to the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and the Fifth Amendment (the “Fifth Term Loan Amendment”) to the 2018 Term Loan Facility. The amendments, among others, extended the period during which the testing under a financial covenant is suspended, lowered the fixed charge coverage ratio to be maintained thereafter, extended the applicability of certain revised eligibility criteria for trade receivables and waived certain term loan amortization payments.
On April 26, 2021, Vince, LLC entered into the Sixth Amendment (the “Sixth Term Loan Amendment”) to the 2018 Term Loan Facility. This amendment extends the waiver of the fixed charge coverage ratio measurement until January 28, 2023 in order to create more flexibility as the Company recovers from the pandemic. Until January 28, 2023, Vince will continue to be subject to the springing covenant whereby Vince is required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 in the event the excess availability under its existing revolver facility is less than $7,500 until July 31, 2021 and $10,000 after August 1, 2021. Concurrently with the Sixth Term Loan Amendment, the Company entered into the Sixth Amendment (the “Sixth Revolver Amendment”) to the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility which consents to the Sixth Term Loan Amendment and amends certain definitions to reflect the Sixth Term Loan Amendment.
See “Financing Activities” below, Note 5 “Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements” and Note 15 “Subsequent Events” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for more details on these amendments.
Third Lien Credit Agreement
On December 11, 2020, Vince, LLC entered into a $20,000 subordinated term loan credit facility (the “Third Lien Credit Facility”) pursuant to a credit agreement (the “Third Lien Credit Agreement”), dated December 11, 2020, by and among Vince, LLC, as the borrower, SK Financial Services, LLC (“SK Financial”), as agent and lender, and other lenders from time to time party thereto. SK Financial is an affiliate of Sun Capital, whose affiliates own approximately 72% of the Company’s common stock. The Third Lien Credit Facility was reviewed and approved by the Special Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors, consisting solely of directors not affiliated with Sun Capital, which committee was represented by independent legal advisors. Interest and closing fees on loans under the Third Lien Credit Facility are payable in kind. The proceeds were received on December 11, 2020 and were used to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. See “Financing Activities” below and Note 5 “Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for more details.
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities during fiscal 2020 was $25,071 which consisted of a net loss of $65,649, impacted by non-cash items of $37,630 and cash provided by working capital of $2,948. Net cash provided by working capital resulted from a cash inflow in receivables, net of $6,594 driven largely by the timing of collections offset by a cash outflow in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $6,563 primarily due to the timing of payments to vendors and a cash outflow in inventories of $1,823 as higher aged inventory (which was driven by the impact of COVID-19) was mostly offset by reduced inventory purchases and the timing of inventory receipts.
Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2019 was $16,819 which consisted of a net income of $30,396, impacted by non-cash items of $(23,581) and cash provided by working capital of $10,004. Net cash provided by working capital resulted from a cash inflow in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $7,606 primarily due to the timing of payments to vendors and a cash inflow in inventories of $5,252 due to lower in-transit inventories, partly offset by a cash outflow in receivables, net of $2,577 driven largely by the timing of collections.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities of $3,497 during fiscal 2020 represents capital expenditures related to retail store build-outs, including leasehold improvements and store fixtures.
Net cash used in investing activities of $4,523 during fiscal 2019 represents capital expenditures related to retail store build-outs, including leasehold improvements and store fixtures.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $31,787 during fiscal 2020, primarily consisting of $20,000 of net proceeds from borrowings under the Third Lien Credit Facility and $12,676 of net proceeds from borrowings under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility.
Net cash used in financing activities was $11,991 during fiscal 2019, primarily consisting of $17,649 of net repayments of borrowings under the Acquired Businesses revolving credit facilities and $2,750 of repayments under the 2018 Term Loan Facility partly offset by $8,707 of net proceeds received under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. The acquisition of the Acquired Businesses was funded with borrowings under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility of which $19,099, plus accrued interest, was used to repay the outstanding debt obligations under the Acquired Businesses Revolving Credit Facilities.
2018 Term Loan Facility
On August 21, 2018, Vince, LLC entered into a $27,500 senior secured term loan facility (the “2018 Term Loan Facility”) pursuant to a credit agreement by and among Vince, LLC, as the borrower, VHC and Vince Intermediate Holdings, LLC, a direct subsidiary of VHC and the direct parent company of Vince, LLC (“Vince Intermediate”), as guarantors, Crystal Financial, LLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the other lenders from time to time party thereto. The 2018 Term Loan Facility is subject to quarterly amortization of principal equal to 2.5% of the original aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Term Loan Facility, with the balance payable at final maturity. Interest is payable on loans under the 2018 Term Loan Facility at a rate equal to the 90-day LIBOR rate (subject to a 0% floor) plus applicable margins subject to a pricing grid based on a minimum Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement for the 2018 Term Loan Facility) calculation. During the continuance of certain specified events of default, interest will accrue on the outstanding amount of any loan at a rate of 2.0% in excess of the rate otherwise applicable to such amount. The 2018 Term Loan Facility matures on the earlier of August 21, 2023 and the maturity date of the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below).
The 2018 Term Loan Facility contains a requirement that Vince, LLC maintain a Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the credit agreement for the 2018 Term Loan Facility) as of the last day of any period of four fiscal quarters not to exceed 0.85:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ended November 3, 2018, 1.00:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ended February 2, 2019, 1.20:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ended May 4, 2019, 1.35:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending August 3, 2019, 1.50:1.00 for the fiscal quarters ending November 2, 2019 and February 1, 2020 and 1.75:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending May 2, 2020 and each fiscal quarter thereafter. In addition, the 2018 Term Loan Facility contains customary representations and warranties, other covenants, and events of default, including but not limited to, covenants with respect to limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, liens, burdensome agreements, guarantees, investments, loans, asset sales, mergers, acquisitions, prepayment of other debt, the repurchase of capital stock, transactions with affiliates, and the ability to change the nature of the Company’s business or its fiscal year, and distributions and dividends. The 2018 Term Loan Facility generally permits dividends to the extent that no default or event of default is continuing or would result from a contemplated dividend, so long as (i) after giving pro forma effect to the contemplated dividend and for the following six months Excess Availability will be at least the greater of 20.0% of the Loan Cap (as defined in the credit agreement for the 2018 Term Loan Facility) and $10,000, (ii) after giving pro forma effect to the contemplated dividend, the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the 12 months preceding such dividend will be greater than or equal to 1.0 to 1.0 (provided that the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio may be less than 1.0 to 1.0 if, after giving pro forma effect to the contemplated dividend, Excess Availability for the six fiscal months following the dividend is at least the greater of 25.0% of the Loan Cap and $12,500), and (iii) the pro forma Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio after giving effect to such contemplated dividend is no less than the minimum Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for such quarter. In addition, the 2018 Term Loan Facility is subject to a Borrowing Base (as defined in the credit agreement of the 2018 Term Loan Facility) which can, under certain conditions, result in the imposition of a reserve under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. As of January 30, 2021, the Company was in compliance with applicable covenants.
The 2018 Term Loan Facility also contains an Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the credit agreement for the 2018 Term Loan Facility) sweep requirement in which Vince, LLC remits 50% of Excess Cash Flow reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by any voluntary prepayments of the 2018 Term Loan Facility or the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility (to the extent accompanied by a permanent reduction in commitments) during such fiscal year or after the fiscal year but prior to the date of the excess cash flow payment, to be applied to the outstanding principal balance commencing 10 business days after the filing of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K starting from fiscal year ended February 1, 2020. There was no such payment due for fiscal years ended January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020.
On March 30, 2020, Vince, LLC entered into the Limited Waiver and Amendment (the “Second Term Loan Amendment”) to the 2018 Term Loan Facility. The Second Term Loan Amendment postponed the amortization payment due on April 1, 2020, with 50% of such payment to be paid on July 1, 2020 and the remainder to be paid on October 1, 2020 and modifies certain reporting obligations.
On June 8, 2020, Vince, LLC entered into the Third Amendment (the “Third Term Loan Amendment”) to the 2018 Term Loan Facility. The Third Term Loan Amendment, among others, (i) temporarily suspends the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio covenant through the delivery of a compliance certificate relating to the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2021 (such period, the “Third Amendment Extended Accommodation Period”); (ii) requires Vince, LLC to maintain Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 in the event the excess availability under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility is less than (x) $10,000 between September 6, 2020 and January 9, 2021 and (y) $12,500 between January 10, 2021 and January 31, 2021 and (z) $15,000 during all other times during the Third Amendment Extended Accommodation Period; (iii) revises the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio required to be maintained following the Third Amendment Extended Accommodation Period (commencing with the fiscal month ending July 31, 2021) to be 1.50 to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter ending July 31, 2021 and 1.75 to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter thereafter; (iv) waives the amortization payments due on July 1, 2020 and October 1, 2020 (including the amortization payment due on April 1, 2020 that was previously deferred under the Second Term Loan Amendment); (v) for any fiscal four quarter period ending prior to or on October 30, 2020, increasing the cap on certain items eligible to be added back to Consolidated EBITDA to 27.5% from 22.5%; and (vi) during the Third Amendment Extended Accommodation Period, allows Vince, LLC to cure any default under the applicable Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio covenant by including any amount provided by equity or subordinated debt (which amount shall be at least $1,000) in the
calculation of excess availability under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility so that the excess availability is above the applicable threshold described above.
The Third Term Loan Amendment also (a) waives certain events of default; (b) temporarily revises the applicable margin to be 9.0% for one year after the Third Term Loan Amendment effective date (2.0% of which is to be accrued but not payable in cash until the first anniversary of the Third Term Loan Amendment effective date) and after such time and through the Third Amendment Extended Accommodation Period, 9.0% or 7.0% depending on the amount of Consolidated EBITDA; (c) increases the LIBOR floor from 0% to 1.0%; (d) eliminates the Borrower’s and any loan party’s ability to designate subsidiaries as unrestricted and to make certain payments, restricted payments and investments during the Third Amendment Extended Accommodation Period; (e) resets the prepayment premium to 3.0% of the prepaid amount if prepaid prior to the first anniversary of the Third Term Loan Amendment Effective Date, 1.5% of the prepaid amount if prepaid prior to the second anniversary of the Third Term Loan Amendment Effective Date and 0% thereafter; (f) imposes a requirement to pay down the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility to the extent cash on hand exceeds $5,000 on the last day of each week; (g) permits Vince, LLC to incur up to $8,000 of additional secured debt (in addition to any interest accrued or paid in kind), to the extent subordinated to the 2018 Term Loan Facility on terms reasonably acceptable to Crystal; (h) extends the delivery periods for (x) annual financial statements for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2020 to June 15, 2020 and (y) quarterly financial statements for the fiscal quarters ended May 2, 2020 and ending August 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020 and October 29, 2020, respectively, and (i) grants ongoing relief through September 30, 2020 with respect to certain covenants regarding the payment of lease obligations.
As a result of the Third Term Loan Amendment, the Company incurred $383 of additional financing costs. In accordance with ASC Topic 470, “Debt”, the Company accounted for this amendment as a debt modification and has recorded $233 of the financing costs paid to third parties within selling, general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in this Annual Report for fiscal 2020. The remaining $150 of financing costs are recorded as deferred debt issuance costs which will be amortized over the remaining term of the 2018 Term Loan Facility.
On December 11, 2020, Vince, LLC entered into the Fifth Term Loan Amendment to the 2018 Term Loan Facility. The Fifth Term Loan Amendment, among other things, (i) extends the suspension of the FCCR covenant through the Extended Accommodation Period; (ii) extends the period through which the applicable margin is increased to 9.0% or 7.0%, subject to a pricing grid based on Consolidated EBITDA through the Extended Accommodation Period; (iii) extends the period from October 30, 2021 to January 29, 2022, during which the cap on which certain items eligible to be added back to “Consolidated EBITDA” (as defined in the 2018 Term Loan Facility) is increased to 27.5% from 22.5%; (iv) requires Vince, LLC to maintain an FCCR of 1.0 to 1.0 in the event the excess availability under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility is less than (x) $7,500 through the end of the Accommodation Period; and (y) $10,000 from August 1, 2020 through the end of the Extended Accommodation Period; (v) revises the FCCR required to be maintained commencing with the fiscal quarter ending January 29, 2022 and for each fiscal quarter thereafter to be 1.25 to 1.0; (vi) waives the amortization payments due on January 1, 2021, April 1, 2021, July 1, 2021, October 1, 2021 and January 1, 2022; (vii) permits Vince, LLC to incur the debt under the Third Lien Credit Facility (as described below); (viii) resets the prepayment premium to 3.0% of the prepaid amount if prepaid prior to the first anniversary of the Fifth Term Loan Amendment effective date, 1.5% of the prepaid amount if prepaid prior to the second anniversary of the Fifth Term Loan Amendment effective date and 0% thereafter; (ix) requires an engagement by the Company of a financial advisor from February 1, 2021 until March 31, 2021 (or until the excess availability is greater than 25% of the loan cap for a period of at least thirty days, whichever is later) to assist in the preparation of certain financial reports, including the review of the weekly cashflow reports and other items; and (x) revises the advance rate on the intellectual property to 60% of its appraised value. As of April 2021, the requirement to engage a financial advisor has been satisfied.
As a result of the Fifth Term Loan Amendment, the Company incurred $150 of additional financing costs. In accordance with ASC Topic 470, “Debt”, the Company accounted for this amendment as a debt modification and has recorded the additional deferred financing costs as deferred debt issuance costs which will be amortized over the remaining term of the 2018 Term Loan Facility and are included in accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 30, 2021.
On April 26, 2021, Vince, LLC entered into the Sixth Term Loan Amendment to the 2018 Term Loan Facility. See Note 15 “Subsequent Events” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for further information.
Through January 30, 2021, on an inception to date basis, the Company had made repayments totaling $2,750 in the aggregate on the 2018 Term Loan Facility. As of January 30, 2021, the Company had $24,750 of debt outstanding under the 2018 Term Loan Facility.
2018 Revolving Credit Facility
On August 21, 2018, Vince, LLC entered into an $80,000 senior secured revolving credit facility (the “2018 Revolving Credit Facility”) pursuant to a credit agreement by and among Vince, LLC, as the borrower, VHC and Vince Intermediate, as guarantors, Citizens Bank, N.A. (“Citizens”), as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the other lenders from time to time party thereto. The 2018 Revolving Credit Facility provides for a revolving line of credit of up to $80,000, subject to a Loan Cap, which is the lesser of (i) the Borrowing Base as defined in the credit agreement for the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) the aggregate commitments, as well as a letter of credit sublimit of $25,000. It also provides for an increase in aggregate commitments of up to
$20,000. The 2018 Revolving Credit Facility matures on the earlier of August 21, 2023 and the maturity date of the 2018 Term Loan Facility. On August 21, 2018, Vince, LLC incurred $39,555 of borrowings, prior to which $66,271 was available, given the Loan Cap as of such date.
Interest is payable on the loans under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility at either the LIBOR or the Base Rate, in each case, with applicable margins subject to a pricing grid based on an average daily excess availability calculation. The “Base Rate” means, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by Citizens as its prime rate; (ii) the Federal Funds Rate for such day, plus 0.5%; and (iii) the LIBOR Rate for a one month interest period as determined on such day, plus 1.00%. During the continuance of certain specified events of default, at the election of Citizens, interest will accrue at a rate of 2.0% in excess of the applicable non-default rate.
The 2018 Revolving Credit Facility contains a requirement that, at any point when Excess Availability (as defined in the credit agreement for the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility) is less than 10.0% of the loan cap and continuing until Excess Availability exceeds the greater of such amounts for 30 consecutive days, Vince must maintain during that time a Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the credit agreement for the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility) equal to or greater than 1.0 to 1.0 measured as of the last day of each fiscal month during such period.
The 2018 Revolving Credit Facility contains representations and warranties, other covenants and events of default that are customary for this type of financing, including covenants with respect to limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, liens, burdensome agreements, guarantees, investments, loans, asset sales, mergers, acquisitions, prepayment of other debt, the repurchase of capital stock, transactions with affiliates, and the ability to change the nature of the Company’s business or its fiscal year. The 2018 Revolving Credit Facility generally permits dividends in the absence of any event of default (including any event of default arising from a contemplated dividend), so long as (i) after giving pro forma effect to the contemplated dividend and for the following six months Excess Availability will be at least the greater of 20.0% of the Loan Cap and $10,000 and (ii) after giving pro forma effect to the contemplated dividend, the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the 12 months preceding such dividend will be greater than or equal to 1.0 to 1.0 (provided that the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio may be less than 1.0 to 1.0 if, after giving pro forma effect to the contemplated dividend, Excess Availability for the six fiscal months following the dividend is at least the greater of 25.0% of the Loan Cap and $12,500). As of January 30, 2021, the Company was in compliance with applicable covenants.
On November 1, 2019, Vince, LLC entered into the First Amendment (the “First Revolver Amendment”) to the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, which provides the borrower the ability to elect the Daily LIBOR Rate in lieu of the Base Rate to be applied to the borrowings upon applicable notice. The “Daily LIBOR Rate” means a rate equal to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate in effect on such day for deposits for a one day period, provided that, upon notice and not more than once every 90 days, such rate may be substituted for a one week or one month period for the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for a one day period.
On November 4, 2019, Vince, LLC entered into the Second Amendment (the “Second Revolver Amendment”) to the credit agreement of the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. The Second Revolver Amendment increased the aggregate commitments under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility by $20,000 to $100,000. Pursuant to the terms of the Second Revolver Amendment, the Acquired Businesses became guarantors under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and jointly and severally liable for the obligations thereunder. Simultaneously, Vince, LLC entered into a Joinder Amendment to the credit agreement of the 2018 Term Loan Facility whereby the Acquired Businesses became guarantors under the 2018 Term Loan Facility and jointly and severally liable for the obligations thereunder.
On June 8, 2020, Vince, LLC entered into the Third Amendment (the “Third Revolver Amendment”) to the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. The Third Revolver Amendment, among others, increases availability under the facility’s borrowing base by (i) temporarily increasing the aggregate commitments under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility to $110,000 through November 30, 2020 (such period, the “Third Amendment Accommodation Period”) (ii) temporarily revising the eligibility of certain account debtors during the Third Amendment Accommodation Period by extending by 30 days the period during which those accounts may remain outstanding past due as well as increasing the concentration limits of certain account debtors and (iii) for any fiscal four quarter period ending prior to or on October 30, 2021, increasing the cap on certain items eligible to be added back to Consolidated EBITDA to 27.5% from 22.5%.
The Third Revolver Amendment also (a) waives events of default; (b) temporarily increases the applicable margin on all borrowings of revolving loans by 0.75% per annum during the Third Amendment Accommodation Period and increases the LIBOR floor from 0% to 1.0%; (c) eliminates Vince LLC’s and any loan party’s ability to designate subsidiaries as unrestricted and to make certain payments, restricted payments and investments during the Third Amendment Extended Accommodation Period; (d) temporarily suspends the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio covenant through the Third Amendment Extended Accommodation Period; (e) requires Vince, LLC to maintain a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 in the event the excess availability under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility is less than (x) $10,000 between September 6, 2020 and January 9, 2021, (y) $12,500 between January 10, 2021 and January 31, 2021 and (z) $15,000 at all other times during the Third Amendment Extended Accommodation Period; (f) imposes a requirement (y) to pay down the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility to the extent cash on hand exceeds $5,000 on the last day of each week and (z) that, after giving effect to any borrowing thereunder, Vince, LLC may have no more than $5,000 of cash on
hand; (g) permits Vince, LLC to incur up to $8,000 of additional secured debt (in addition to any interest accrued or paid in kind), to the extent subordinated to the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility on terms reasonably acceptable to Citizens; (h) establishes a method for imposing a successor reference rate if LIBOR should become unavailable, (i) extends the delivery periods for (x) annual financial statements for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2020 to June 15, 2020 and (y) quarterly financial statements for the fiscal quarters ended May 2, 2020 and ending August 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020 and October 29, 2020, respectively, and (j) grants ongoing relief through September 30, 2020 with respect to certain covenants regarding the payment of lease obligations.
As a result of the Third Revolver Amendment, the Company incurred $376 of additional deferred financing costs. In accordance with ASC Topic 470, “Debt”, the Company accounted for this amendment as a debt modification and has recorded the additional deferred financing costs as deferred debt issuance costs which will be amortized over the remaining term of the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility.
On December 11, 2020, Vince, LLC entered into the Fifth Revolver Amendment to the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. The Fifth Revolver Amendment, among other things, (i) extends the period from November 30, 2020 to July 31, 2021 (such period, “Accommodation Period”), during which the eligibility of certain account debtors is revised by extending by 30 days the time those accounts may remain outstanding past due as well as increasing the concentration limits of certain account debtors; (ii) extends the period through which the applicable margin on all borrowings of revolving loans by 0.75% per annum during such Accommodation Period; (iii) extends the period from October 30, 2021 to January 29, 2022, during which the cap on which certain items eligible to be added back to “Consolidated EBITDA” (as defined in the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility) is increased to 27.5% from 22.5%; (iv) extends the temporary suspension of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (“FCCR”) covenant through the delivery of a compliance certificate relating to the fiscal quarter ended January 29, 2022 (such period, the “Extended Accommodation Period”), other than the fiscal quarter ending January 29, 2022; (v) requires Vince, LLC to maintain an FCCR of 1.0 to 1.0 in the event the excess availability under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility is less than (x) $7,500 through the end of the Accommodation Period; and (y) $10,000 from August 1, 2020 through the end of the Extended Accommodation Period; (vi) permits Vince, LLC to incur the debt under the Third Lien Credit Facility (as described below); (vii) revises the definition of “Cash Dominion Trigger Amount” to mean $15,000 through the end of the Extended Accommodation Period and at all other times thereafter, 12.5% of the loan cap and $5,000, whichever is greater; (viii) deems the Cash Dominion Event (as defined in the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility) as triggered during the Accommodation Period; and (ix) requires an engagement by the Company of a financial advisor from February 1, 2021 until March 31, 2021 (or until the excess availability is greater than 25% of the loan cap for a period of at least thirty days, whichever is later) to assist in the preparation of certain financial reports, including the review of the weekly cashflow reports and other items. As of April 2021, the requirement to engage a financial advisor has been satisfied.
As a result of the Fifth Revolver Amendment, the Company incurred $204 of additional deferred financing costs. In accordance with ASC Topic 470, “Debt”, the Company accounted for this amendment as a debt modification and has recorded the additional deferred financing costs as deferred debt issuance costs which will be amortized over the remaining term of the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. $100 of financing costs are included in accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 30, 2021.
Concurrently with the Sixth Term Loan Amendment, the Company entered into the Sixth Revolver Amendment to the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 15 “Subsequent Events” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for further information.
As of January 30, 2021, $30,176 was available under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, net of the loan cap, and there were $40,399 of borrowings outstanding and $5,195 of letters of credit outstanding under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. The weighted average interest rate for borrowings outstanding under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility as of January 30, 2021 was 3.8%.
As of February 1, 2020, $59,916 was available under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, net of the loan cap, and there were $27,723 of borrowings outstanding and $6,505 of letters of credit outstanding under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. The weighted average interest rate for borrowings outstanding under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility as of February 1, 2020 was 3.3%.
Third Lien Credit Agreement
On December 11, 2020, Vince, LLC entered into the $20,000 Third Lien Credit Facility pursuant to the Third Lien Credit Agreement. The Third Lien Credit Facility matures on the earlier of (a) February 21, 2024, (b) the date that is 360 days after the “Maturity Date” under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility so long as the loans under the 2018 Term Loan Facility remain outstanding and (c) 180 days after the “Maturity Date” under the 2018 Term Loan Facility and the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility.
SK Financial is an affiliate of Sun Capital, whose affiliates own approximately 72% of the Company’s common stock. The Third Lien Credit Facility was reviewed and approved by the Special Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors, consisting solely of directors not affiliated with Sun Capital, which committee was represented by independent legal advisors.
Interest on loans under the Third Lien Credit Facility is payable in kind at a rate equal to the LIBOR rate (subject to a floor of 1.0%) plus applicable margins subject to a pricing grid based on minimum Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Third Lien Credit Agreement). During the continuance of certain specified events of default, interest may accrue on the loans under the Third Lien Credit Facility at a rate of 2.0% in excess of the rate otherwise applicable to such amount. The Third Lien Credit Facility contains representations, covenants and conditions that are substantially similar to those under the 2018 Term Loan Facility, except the Third Lien Credit Facility does not contain any financial covenant.
The Company has incurred $485 in deferred financing costs associated with the Third Lien Credit Facility of which a $400 closing fee is payable in kind and is added to the principal balance. These deferred financing costs are recorded as deferred debt issuance costs which will be amortized over the remaining term of the Third Lien Credit.
All obligations under the Third Lien Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Company, Vince Intermediate Holding, LLC and the Company’s existing material domestic restricted subsidiaries as well as any future material domestic restricted subsidiaries and are secured on a junior basis relative to the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2018 Term Loan Facility by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company, Vince Intermediate Holding, LLC, Vince, LLC and the Company’s existing material domestic restricted subsidiaries as well as any future material domestic restricted subsidiaries.
The proceeds were received on December 11, 2020 and were used to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility.
Acquired Businesses Short-Term Borrowings
On July 23, 2014, Parker Lifestyle, LLC, as borrower, and Sun Capital Partners V, L.P., as guarantor, entered into a Loan Authorization Agreement with BMO Harris Bank N.A., as lender, for a revolving credit facility. On December 21, 2016, that facility was amended to include Rebecca Taylor, Inc. The maximum credit line was $25,000 (the “BMO Obligations”) subject to a maximum credit limit, which required that the sum of (i) the aggregate principal amounts of loans outstanding, (ii) the aggregate undrawn stated amount of letters of credit issued under the credit facility, and (iii) the aggregate amount of any unreimbursed draws under any letters of credit issued, shall not exceed the credit limit. Any letters of credit issued under the BMO Obligations credit facility were subject to the same maximum credit line. On November 3, 2019, in conjunction with the acquisition of the Acquired Businesses, $19,099 plus accrued interest of the cash consideration was used to pay-off the outstanding debt obligation under this facility. On November 3, 2019, at the request of the Company and upon the satisfaction of certain release conditions, the BMO Obligations were released.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes during the periods presented herein.
Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of January 30, 2021:
(1)
Consists primarily of inventory purchase obligations and service contracts.
(2)
VHC entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with the Pre-IPO Stockholders (as described in Note 14 “Related Party Transactions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report).
The summary above does not include the following items:
•
As of January 30, 2021, we have recorded $2,304 of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties. We are unable to make reliable estimates of cash flows by period due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding the effective settlement of these positions.
•
Interest payable under the 2018 Term Loan Facility, which is calculated at a rate equal to the 90-day LIBOR rate (subject to a 1.0% floor) plus applicable margins subject to a pricing grid based on a minimum Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement for the 2018 Term Loan Facility) calculation. The Third Term Loan Amendment and the Fifth Term Loan Amendment, among other things, temporarily revised the applicable margin to be 9.0% for one year after the Third Term Loan Amendment effective date (2.0% of which is to be accrued but not payable in cash until the first anniversary of the Third Term Loan Amendment effective date) and after such time and through the Extended Accommodation Period, 9.0% or 7.0% depending on the amount of Consolidated EBITDA. See Note 5 “Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional information.
•
Interest payable under the 2018 Revolving Credit facility, which is calculated at either the LIBOR rate (subject to a 1.0% floor) or the Base Rate, in each case, with applicable margins subject to a pricing grid based on an average daily excess availability calculation. The “Base Rate” means, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by Citizens as its prime rate; (ii) the Federal Funds Rate for such day, plus 0.5%; and (iii) the LIBOR Rate for a one month interest period as determined on such day, plus 1.00%. The Third Revolver Amendment and the Fifth Revolver Amendment, among other things, temporarily increased the applicable margin on all borrowings of revolving loans by 0.75% per annum through the adjustment date following the Accommodation Period. See Note 5 “Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional information.
•
Interest payable under the Third Lien Credit Facility is payable in kind at a rate equal to the LIBOR rate (subject to a floor of 1.0%) plus applicable margins subject to a pricing grid based on a minimum Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Third Lien Credit Agreement).
Seasonality
The apparel and fashion industry in which we operate is cyclical and, consequently, our revenues are affected by general economic conditions and the seasonal trends characteristic to the apparel and fashion industry. Purchases of apparel are sensitive to a number of factors that influence the level of consumer spending, including economic conditions and the level of disposable consumer income, consumer debt, interest rates and consumer confidence as well as the impact of adverse weather conditions. In addition, fluctuations in the amount of sales in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting direct-to-consumer sales; as such, the financial results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the fiscal year. We expect such seasonality to continue.
Inflation
While inflation may impact our sales, cost of goods sold and expenses, we believe the effects of inflation on our results of operations and financial condition are not significant. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation, management believes it has not been significant and cannot provide any assurances that our results of operations and financial condition will not be materially impacted by inflation in the future.
Critical Accounting Policies
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an on-going basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
The following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. With respect to critical accounting policies, even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent consolidated results of operations. For more information on our accounting policies, please refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.
Revenue Recognition and Reserves for Allowances
The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations identified under the terms of contracts with its customers are satisfied, which generally occurs upon the transfer of control in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions of the sale. Sales are recognized when the control of the goods are transferred to the customer for the Company’s wholesale businesses, upon receipt by the customer for the Company’s e-commerce businesses, and at the time of sale to the consumer for the Company’s retail businesses. Sales are measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods, which includes
estimates for variable consideration. Variable consideration mainly includes discounts, chargebacks, markdown allowances, cooperative advertising programs, and sales returns. Estimated amounts of discounts, chargebacks, markdown allowances, cooperative advertising programs, and sales returns are accounted for as reductions of sales when the associated sale occurs. These estimated amounts are adjusted periodically based on changes in facts and circumstances when the changes become known. On the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, reserves for sales returns are included within other accrued liabilities, and the value of inventory associated with reserves for sales returns are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The Company continues to estimate the amount of sales returns based on known trends and historical return rates.
Accounts receivable are recorded net of allowances for expected future chargebacks and margin support from wholesale partners. It is the nature of the apparel and fashion industry that suppliers like us face significant pressure from wholesale partners in the retail industry to provide allowances to compensate for their margin shortfalls. This pressure often takes the form of customers requiring us to provide price concessions on prior shipments as a prerequisite for obtaining future orders. Pressure for these concessions is largely determined by overall retail sales performance and, more specifically, the performance of our products at retail. To the extent our wholesale partners have more of our goods on hand at the end of the season, there will be greater pressure for us to grant markdown concessions on prior shipments. Our accounts receivable balances are reported net of expected allowances for these matters based on the historical level of concessions required and our estimates of the level of markdowns and allowances that will be required in the coming season. We evaluate the allowance balances on a continual basis and adjust them as necessary to reflect changes in anticipated allowance activity. We also provide an allowance for sales returns based on known trends and historical return rates.
At January 30, 2021, a hypothetical 1% change in the reserves for allowances would have resulted in a change of $76 in accounts receivable and net sales.
Inventory Valuation
Inventory values are reduced to net realizable value when there are factors indicating that certain inventories will not be sold on terms sufficient to recover their cost. Out-of-season inventories may be sold to off-price retailers and other customers who serve a customer base that will purchase prior year fashions and may be liquidated through our outlets and our e-commerce websites. The amount, if any, that these customers will pay for prior year fashions is determined by the desirability of the inventory itself as well as the general level of prior year goods available to these customers. The assessment of inventory value, as a result, is highly subjective and requires an assessment of the seasonality of the inventory, its future desirability, and future price levels in the off-price sector.
In our wholesale businesses, some of our products are purchased for and sold to specific customers’ orders. For the remainder of our business, products are purchased in anticipation of selling them to a specific customer based on historical trends. The loss of a major customer, whether due to the customer’s financial difficulty or other reasons, could have a significant negative impact on the value of the inventory expected to be sold to that customer. This negative impact can also extend to purchase obligations for goods that have not yet been received. These obligations involve product to be received into inventory over the next one to six months.
At January 30, 2021, a hypothetical 1% change in the inventory obsolescence reserve would have resulted in a change of $82 in inventory, net of cost of products sold.
Fair Value Assessments of Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually and in an interim period if a triggering event occurs. As discussed in further detail below, we determined that a triggering event occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and during the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
An entity may elect to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. If adverse qualitative trends are identified during the qualitative assessment that indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is required. “Step one” of the quantitative impairment test for goodwill requires an entity to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare such fair value to the respective carrying amount. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired, and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recorded for the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The goodwill impairment test is dependent on a number of factors, including estimates of projected revenues, EBITDA margins, long-term growth rates, working capital, discount rates and other variables. We base our estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.
We estimate the fair value of our tradename intangible assets using a discounted cash flow valuation analysis, which is based on the “relief from royalty” methodology. This methodology assumes that in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these types of assets. The relief from royalty approach is dependent on a number of factors, including estimates of projected revenues, royalty rates in the category of intellectual property, discount rates and other variables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently
uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. We recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the tradename intangible asset is less than the carrying value.
An entity may pass on performing the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset and directly perform the quantitative assessment. This determination can be made on an asset by asset basis, and an entity may resume performing a qualitative assessment in subsequent periods.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company determined that a triggering event had occurred as a result of changes to the Company’s long-term projections driven by the impacts of COVID-19. The change in performance was primarily driven by the shutdown of the wholesale partners’ retail locations domestically and internationally, resulting in reduced orders, decreased revenue and lower current and expected future cash flow. The Company performed an interim quantitative impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets.
A quantitative impairment test on the goodwill allocated to the Vince Wholesale reporting unit determined that the fair value was below the carrying value. The Company estimated the fair value using a combination of discounted cash flows and market comparisons. “Step one” of the assessment determined that the fair value was below the carrying amount by $9,462, and as a result the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $9,462 within Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in fiscal 2020.
The Company estimated the fair value of the Vince and Rebecca Taylor tradename indefinite-lived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow valuation analysis, which is based on the relief from royalty method and determined that the fair value of the Vince and Rebecca Taylor tradenames were below their carrying amounts. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charge for the Vince and Rebecca Taylor tradename indefinite-lived intangible assets of $4,386 which was recorded within Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in fiscal 2020.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company identified facts and circumstances that indicated that the fair value of goodwill associated with Rebecca Taylor and Parker, the Rebecca Taylor tradename and the Parker tradename may not be recoverable, resulting in the determination that a triggering event had occurred. Because of decreases in projected revenues and declines in margins due to increases of aged inventory related to the Rebecca Taylor and Parker brands that were considered other than temporary, the Company performed a quantitative assessment on goodwill and these indefinite-lived intangible assets.
The Company estimated the fair value of the Rebecca Taylor and Parker tradename intangible assets using the relief from royalty methodology and determined that the fair value of the Rebecca Taylor and Parker tradenames were below their carrying amounts. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charge for the Rebecca Taylor and Parker tradename intangible assets of $11,247, which was recorded within Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in fiscal 2019. Significant assumptions utilized in these analyses included projected revenue growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates. A quantitative impairment test on the goodwill allocated to the Rebecca Taylor and Parker reporting unit determined that the fair value was below the carrying value. The Company estimated the fair value using the income valuation approach. “Step one” of the assessment determined that the fair value was below the carrying amount by $2,129, and as a result the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $2,129 within Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in fiscal 2019.
In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 350, indefinite-lived intangibles should be reassessed each reporting period to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite life. Based on the factors that led to the recognition of the Parker tradename impairment charge, the Company determined that the indefinite life classification was no longer appropriate for the Parker tradename. Accordingly, the Company determined a 10-year useful life was more appropriate and began amortizing the Parker tradename as of the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
In both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, the Company performed its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter. In fiscal 2020, the Company elected to perform a quantitative impairment test on goodwill allocated to the Company’s Vince Wholesale reporting unit. The results of the quantitative test did not result in any impairment because the fair value of the Company’s Vince Wholesale reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by less than 1%. The more significant assumptions used in projecting the discounted cash flows included: a discount rate of 19%, which was determined from relevant market comparisons and adjusted for company specific risks and projected EBITDA margins of low double-digits based upon our current and past performance as well as industry data. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the valuation model. As an example, the impact of a hypothetical change in each of the significant assumptions is described below. In quantifying the impact, we changed only the specific assumption and held all other assumptions constant. A hypothetical 1% change in the discount rate would increase/decrease the fair value by approximately 5%. Finally, a hypothetical 1% change in the EBITDA margin rate for each year utilized in the analysis would increase/decrease the fair value by approximately 7%. Any changes in fair value resulting from changes in the assumptions discussed above could potentially result in the carrying amount of the Company’s Vince Wholesale reporting unit exceeding its estimated fair value, and therefore could require an impairment loss.
In fiscal 2019, the Company elected to perform a qualitative impairment test on goodwill allocated to the Company’s Vince Wholesale reporting unit and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Company’s Vince Wholesale reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and was not impaired.
Goodwill was $31,973 and $41,435 as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, respectively.
The Company also elected to perform a quantitative impairment test on its Vince tradename and the Rebecca Taylor tradename indefinite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2020. The results of the quantitative test did not result in any impairment because the fair value of the Company’s Vince tradename and Rebecca Taylor tradename intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by 2% and 9%, respectively. The more significant assumptions used in projecting the discounted cash flows included: a discount rate of 19% and 20% for the Vince and Rebecca Taylor tradenames, respectively, which was determined from relevant market comparisons and adjusted for company specific risks; low single-digit royalty rates and projected revenues based upon our current and past performance as well as industry data. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the valuation model. As an example, the impact of a hypothetical change in each of the significant assumptions is described below. In quantifying the impact, we changed only the specific assumption and held all other assumptions constant. A hypothetical 1% change in discount rate would increase/decrease the fair value by approximately 6% for both the Vince and Rebecca Taylor tradenames. A hypothetical 1% change in the royalty rates would increase/decrease the fair value by approximately 24% and 55% for the Vince and Rebecca Taylor tradenames, respectively. Finally, a hypothetical 1% change in projected revenues for each year utilized in the analysis would increase/decrease the fair value by approximately 1% for both the Vince and Rebecca Taylor tradenames, respectively. Any changes in fair value resulting from changes in the assumptions discussed above could potentially result in the carrying amount of the Company’s Vince tradename or Rebecca Taylor tradename exceeding its estimated fair value, and therefore could require an impairment loss.
In fiscal 2019, the Company elected to perform a qualitative impairment test on its Vince tradename intangible asset and concluded it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company’s Vince tradename intangible asset exceeded its carrying value and the Vince tradename intangible asset was not impaired. There was no additional impairment as part of the annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 for the Rebecca Taylor tradename.
Indefinite-lived tradename intangible assets were $71,800 and $76,186 as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, respectively, which is included within Intangible assets, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Property and Equipment, Operating Lease Assets and Other Finite-Lived Intangible Assets
The Company reviews its property and equipment, operating lease assets and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when the existence of facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than previously estimated or that the carrying amount of the asset groups to which these assets relate may not be recoverable. The asset group is defined as the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available and largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets, which for our retail stores is at the store level. Recoverability of these assets is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of the asset group with its estimated future undiscounted cash flows. The recoverability assessment is dependent on a number of factors, including estimates of future growth and profitability as well as other variables. If the comparisons indicate that the value of the asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the assets within the asset group and the loss is recognized during that period.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, as a result of temporary store closures and the decline in projected cash flows driven by the impacts of COVID-19, the Company determined the need to assess recoverability for a significant portion of its asset groups. Specific to its retail operations, the Company first assessed all of its retail store asset groups, which included a significant portion of the Company’s total operating lease right-of-use assets, to determine if the carrying value was recoverable. This was determined by comparing the net carrying value of the retail store asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group. For the retail store asset groups that failed the recoverability test, an impairment loss was measured, in part, as the amount by which the carrying value of the operating lease right-of-use assets exceeded its fair value. The results of this assessment indicated that the estimated fair value of a portion of the Company’s operating lease right-of-use assets did not exceed the carrying value and an impairment charge was recorded in the amount of $8,556 to the operating lease right-of-use assets balance. The fair value of the operating lease right-of-use assets was determined from the perspective of a market participant considering various factors. The judgments and assumptions used in determining the fair value of the operating lease right-of-use assets were the current comparable market rents for similar properties and a store discount rate. Additionally, as it relates to the retail store asset groups that did not pass the recoverability assessment, the Company recorded non-cash asset impairment charges of $4,470 related to property and equipment. The fair value of the property and equipment was based on its estimated liquidation value.
During fiscal 2019, we recorded non-cash asset impairment charges of $818, within Impairment of long-lived assets on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), related to the impairment of certain retail stores as the carrying values were determined not to be recoverable. The impairment charge consisted of $641 related to property and equipment and $177 related to operating lease right-of-use assets. The carrying amounts of these assets were adjusted to their estimated fair values.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company identified facts and circumstances that indicated that the net book value of finite-lived intangible assets associated with Rebecca Taylor and Parker may not be recoverable, resulting in the determination that a triggering event had occurred. We recorded a non-cash asset impairment charge of $6,115 related to the Rebecca Taylor and Parker customer relationships, within Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), as we had determined that the fair value of these customer relationships was $0. Significant assumptions utilized in these analyses included projected revenue growth rates and discount rates.
The finite-lived intangible assets are comprised of Vince customer relationships which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives of 20 years. After the impairment of the Parker tradename as discussed in “Fair Value Assessments of Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets” above, the Parker tradename intangible asset is now being amortized on a straight-line basis over its useful life of 10 years.
Tax Receivable Agreement
In connection with the consummation of the IPO, we entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with the Pre-IPO Stockholders. The Tax Receivable Agreement provides for payments to the Pre-IPO Stockholders in an amount equal to 85% of the aggregate reduction in taxes payable realized by the Company and its subsidiaries from the utilization of the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits. Amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement are contingent upon, among other things, (i) generation of future taxable income over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement and (ii) changes in tax laws. If we do not generate sufficient taxable income in the aggregate over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement to utilize the tax benefits, then we would not be required to make the related payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Therefore, we would only recognize a liability for the Tax Receivable Agreement obligation if we determine if it is probable that we will generate sufficient future taxable income over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement to utilize the related tax benefits. Estimating future taxable income is inherently uncertain and requires judgment. In projecting future taxable income, we consider our historical results and incorporate certain assumptions, including revenue growth, operating margins, and projected retail location openings, among others. If we determine in the future that we will not be able to fully utilize all or part of the related tax benefits, we would derecognize the portion of the liability related to benefits not expected to be utilized. Alternatively, if we generate additional future taxable income beyond our current estimate, we would recognize additional liability related to benefits expected to be utilized.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement was adjusted as a result of changes in the levels of projected pre-tax income, primarily as a result of COVID-19. The adjustment resulted in a net decrease of $2,320 to the liability under the Tax Receivable Agreement with the corresponding adjustment accounted for within Other income, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). As of January 30, 2021, the Company’s total obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement was estimated to be $0 based on projected future pre-tax income.
Income taxes and Valuation Allowances
We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities at enacted rates. We assess the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and adjust the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe it more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets, including recent earnings results within taxing jurisdictions, expectations of future taxable income, the carryforward periods available and other relevant factors. Changes in the required valuation allowance are recorded in income in the period such determination is made. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes. Changes in estimates may create volatility in our effective tax rate in future periods for various reasons, including changes in tax laws or rates, changes in forecasted amounts of pretax income (loss), settlements with various tax authorities, either favorable or unfavorable, the expiration of the statute of limitations on some tax positions and obtaining new information about particular tax positions that may cause management to change its estimates. The ultimate tax outcome is uncertain for certain transactions. We recognize tax positions in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with tax authorities assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts.
Due to the uncertain nature of the realization of our deferred income tax assets, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we recorded valuation allowances within Provision for income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). During fiscal 2020, the Company recorded additional valuation allowances in the amount of $18,579 and maintained a full valuation allowance on all deferred tax assets that have a definite life as we do not believe it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be recognized. Indefinite-lived net operating losses have been recognized to the extent we believe they can be utilized against indefinite-lived deferred tax liabilities. This valuation allowance is subject to periodic review, and if the allowance is reduced, the tax benefit will be recorded in the future operations as a reduction of our income tax expense.
