Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Introduction
The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, those described above under “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” and “Forward-Looking Statements - Safe Harbor” below. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and are incorporated herein by reference.
We are a real estate investment trust specializing in the ownership, leasing and management of secure, reentry facilities and processing centers and the provision of community-based services and youth services in the United States, Australia, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. We own, lease and operate a broad range of secure facilities including maximum, medium and minimum security facilities, processing centers, and community-based reentry facilities. We offer counseling, education and/or treatment for alcohol and drug abuse problems at most of the domestic facilities we manage. We are also a provider of innovative compliance technologies, industry-leading monitoring services, and evidence-based supervision and treatment programs for community-based parolees, probationers and pretrial defendants. Additionally, we have a contract with ICE to provide supervision and reporting services designed to improve the participation of non-detained aliens in the immigration court system. We develop new facilities based on contract awards, using our project development expertise and experience to design, construct and finance what we believe are state-of-the-art facilities that maximize security and efficiency. We also provide secure transportation services for offender and detainee populations as contracted domestically and in the United Kingdom through our joint venture GEOAmey.
As of December 31, 2020, our worldwide operations included the management and/or ownership of approximately 93,000 beds at 118 correctional, detention and reentry facilities, including idle facilities, and also included the provision of servicing more than 210,000 individuals in a community-based environment on behalf of federal, state and local correctional agencies located in all 50 states.
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had consolidated revenues of $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, and we maintained an average company-wide facility occupancy rate of 86.6% including 89,499 active beds and excluding 3,334 idle beds for the year ended December 31, 2020, and 92.4% including 92,906 active beds and excluding 2,118 idle beds and beds under development for the year ended December 31, 2019.
REIT Conversion
We have been a leading owner, lessor and operator of correctional, detention and reentry facilities and provider of community-based services and youth services in the industry since 1984 and began operating as a REIT for federal income tax purposes effective January 1, 2013. As a result of the REIT conversion, we reorganized our operations and moved non-real estate components into TRSs. Through the TRS structure, the portion of our businesses which are non-real estate related, such as our managed-only contracts, international operations, electronic monitoring services, and other non-residential and community based facilities, are part of wholly-owned taxable subsidiaries of the REIT. Most of our business segments, which are real estate related and involve company-owned and company-leased facilities, are part of the REIT. The TRS structure allows us to maintain the strategic alignment of almost all of our diversified business segments under one entity. The TRS assets and operations will continue to be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes and to foreign taxes as applicable in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located.
As a REIT, we are required to distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gain) and we began paying regular distributions in 2013. We declared and paid the following regular REIT distributions to our shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, which were treated for federal income taxes as follows:
(1)
For 2019 and 2020, there are no Qualified Dividends. Qualified Dividends represents the portion of Total Ordinary Dividends which constitutes a "Qualified Dividend", as defined by the Internal Revenue Service.
(2)
The amount constitutes a "Return of Capital", as defined by the Internal Revenue Service.
On January 15, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock, which was paid on February 1, 2021 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 25, 2021.
Critical Accounting Policies
We believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business, results of operations and financial condition because they involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the development, selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our Board of Directors, and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. As such, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We routinely evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that our management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If actual results significantly differ from our estimates, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted.
Other significant accounting policies, primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below, are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements. The notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value added and other taxes that we collect concurrent with revenue producing activities and that are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenues. The guidance distinguishes between goods and services. The definition of services under the guidance includes everything other than goods. As such, in our case, this guidance views the provision of housing as a service.
When a contract includes variable consideration, we determine an estimate of the variable consideration and evaluate whether the estimate needs to be constrained; therefore, we include the variable consideration in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Variable consideration estimates are updated at each reporting date. A limited number of our domestic contracts have provisions upon which a small portion of the revenue for the contract is based on the performance of certain targets. Domestically, revenue based on the performance of certain targets is less than 1% of our consolidated domestic revenues and was not significant during the periods presented. One of our international contracts, related to our Ravenhall correctional facility project (discussed further below), contains a provision where a significant portion of the revenue for the contract is based on the performance of certain targets. These performance targets are based on specific criteria to be met over specific periods of time. Such criteria includes our ability to achieve certain contractual benchmarks relative to the quality of service we provide, non-occurrence of certain disruptive events, effectiveness of our quality control programs and our responsiveness to customer requirements. The performance of these targets are measured quarterly and there was no significant constraint on the estimate of such variable consideration for this contract during the year ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.
We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which revenue is recognized at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed, which is generally the case for all of our contracts. Incidental items that are immaterial in the context of the contract are recognized as expense. We generally do not incur incremental costs related to obtaining a contract with our customers that would meet the requirement for capitalization. There were no assets recognized from costs to obtain a contract with a customer at December 31, 2020 or 2019.
The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when services are performed which are due from our customers based on the passage of time. We record a contract liability if consideration is received in advance of the performance of services. Generally, our customers do not provide payment in advance of the performance of services. Therefore, any contract liability is not significant at December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019 and revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 that was included in the opening balance of unearned revenue was not significant. There have been no significant amounts of revenue recorded in the periods presented from performance obligations either wholly or partially satisfied in prior periods.
The right to consideration under our contracts is only dependent on the passage of time and is therefore considered to be unconditional. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although, with the exception of the contract receivable related to our Ravenhall correctional facility (further discussed below), terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 days after performance obligations are satisfied and generally do not include a significant financing component. There have been no significant changes in receivable or unearned revenue balances during the period other than regular invoicing and collection activity.
Owned and Leased - Secure Services
We recognize revenue for secure services where we own or lease the facility as services are performed. We provide for the safe and secure housing and care of incarcerated individuals under public-private partnerships with federal, state and local government agencies. This includes providing 24-hour care and supervision, including but not limited to, such services as medical, transportation, food service, laundry services and various programming activities. These tasks are considered to be activities to fulfill the safe and secure housing performance obligation and are not considered to be individually separate promises in the contract. Each of these activities is highly interrelated and we perform a significant level of integration of these activities. We have identified these activities as a bundle of services and determined that each day of the promised service is distinct. The services provided are part of a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and are measured using the same measure of progress (time-based output method). We have determined that revenue for these services are recognized over time as our customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits as the services are performed, which is on a continual daily basis, and we have a right to payment for performance completed to date. Time-based output methods of revenue recognition are considered to be a faithful depiction of our efforts to fulfill our obligations under our contracts and therefore reflect the transfer of services to our customers. Our customers generally pay for these services based on a net rate per day per individual or on a fixed monthly rate.
Owned and Leased - Community-based
We recognize revenue for community-based reentry services where we own or lease the facility in a manner similar to our secure services discussed above. We provide individuals nearing the end of their sentence with the resources necessary to productively transition back into society. Through our residential reentry centers, we provide federal and state parolees and probationers with temporary housing, rehabilitation, substance abuse counseling and vocational and educational programs. These activities are considered to be a bundle of services which are a part of a series of distinct services recognized over time based on the same criteria as discussed above for secure services revenues. Our customers also generally pay for these services based on a net rate per day per individual or on a fixed monthly rate.
Owned and Leased - Youth Services
We recognize revenues for youth services where we own or lease the facility in the same manner as discussed above for the housing, supervision, care and rehabilitation of troubled youth residents. The activities to house and care for troubled youth residents are also considered to be a bundle of services which are part of a series of distinct services recognized over time based on the same criteria discussed for the previous two revenue streams. Our customers generally pay for these services based on a net rate per day per individual.
Managed Only
We recognize revenue for our managed only contracts in the same manner as our Owned and Leased Secure Services and Owned and Leased Community-based contracts as discussed above. The primary exception is that we do not own or lease the facility. The facility is owned by the customer. In certain circumstances, our customers may request that we make certain capital improvements to the facility or make other payments related to the facility. These payments are amortized as a reduction of revenues over the life of the contract. Our customers generally pay for these services based on a net rate per day per individual or a fixed monthly rate.
Facility Construction and Design
During 2020, 2019 and 2018, we had facility construction and design services related to an expansion project at our Fulham Correctional Centre in Australia which was substantially completed in the third quarter of 2020. We determined revenue should be recorded over time using a time-based output method based on the same criteria as discussed above for secure services. Fees included and priced in the contract for managing the Facility are considered to be stated at their individual estimated stand-alone selling prices using the adjusted market assessment approach. These services are regularly provided by us on a stand-alone basis to similar customers within a similar range of amounts. We used the expected cost-plus margin approach to allocate the transaction price to the construction obligation. We were entitled under the contract to receive consideration in the amount of our costs plus a margin.
Non-residential Services and Other
Non-residential Services and Other revenue consists of our contracts with federal and various state and local governments to provide location, alcohol and drug detecting electronic monitoring and case management services to individuals on an as needed or as requested basis. This category also includes our day reporting centers.
We recognize revenues for electronic monitoring and case management services as the services are performed. Services provided consist of community-based supervision (home visits), in-person reporting, telephonic reporting and GPS and other electronic monitoring as well as overall contract management services. The rates for the various services are considered to be stated at their individual stand-alone selling prices. We have determined that the services to be provided are recognized over time based on the unit of occurrence of the various services as our customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as the services are performed and we have a right to payment for performance completed to date. Generally, these services are paid based on a net rate per occurrence and a monthly fee for management services.
Certain of our electronic monitoring contracts include providing monitoring equipment and related monitoring services activities (using internal proprietary software platforms) to our customers. These tasks are considered to be activities to fulfill the promise to provide electronic monitoring services to individuals and are not considered to be individually separate promises in the contract. In the context of the contract, the equipment and monitoring service is not considered to be capable of being distinct as the customer typically cannot benefit from the equipment or monitoring service on its own or with other readily available resources. We have identified these activities as a bundle of services and determined that each day or unit of the promised service is distinct. These services are part of a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and are measured using the same measure of progress (time-based output method) and are therefore accounted for as a single performance obligation. We have determined that services are recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as the services are performed and we have a right to payment for performance completed to date.
Services provided for our day reporting centers are similar to our Owned and Leased Community-based services discussed above with the exception of temporary housing.
Reserves for Insurance Losses
The nature of our business exposes us to various types of third-party legal claims, including, but not limited to, civil rights claims relating to conditions of confinement and/or mistreatment, sexual misconduct claims brought by prisoners or detainees, product liability claims, intellectual property infringement claims, claims relating to employment matters (including, but not limited to, employment discrimination claims, union grievances and wage and hour claims), property loss claims, environmental claims, automobile liability claims, contractual claims and claims for personal injury or other damages resulting from contact with our facilities, programs, electronic monitoring products, personnel or prisoners, including damages arising from a prisoner’s escape or from a disturbance or riot at a facility. In addition, our management contracts generally require us to indemnify the governmental agency against any damages to which the governmental agency may be subject in connection with such claims or litigation. We maintain a broad program of insurance coverage for these general types of claims,
except for claims relating to employment matters, for which we carry no insurance. There can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover all claims to which we may be exposed. It is our general practice to bring merged or acquired companies into our corporate master policies in order to take advantage of certain economies of scale.
We currently maintain a general liability policy and excess liability policies with total limits of $70.0 million per occurrence and $90 million in the aggregate covering the operations of U.S. Secure Services, GEO Care's community-based services, GEO Care's youth services and BI. We have a claims-made liability insurance program with a specific loss limit of $40.0 million per occurrence and in the aggregate related to medical professional liability claims arising out of secure healthcare services. We are uninsured for any claims in excess of these limits. We also maintain insurance to cover property and other casualty risks including, workers’ compensation, environmental liability, cybersecurity liability and automobile liability.
For most casualty insurance policies, we carry substantial deductibles or self-insured retentions of $3.0 million per occurrence for general liability and medical professional liability, $2.0 million per occurrence for workers’ compensation and $1.0 million per occurrence for automobile liability. In addition, certain of our facilities located in Florida and other high-risk hurricane areas carry substantial windstorm deductibles. Since hurricanes are considered unpredictable future events, no reserves have been established to pre-fund for potential windstorm damage. Limited commercial availability of certain types of insurance relating to windstorm exposure in coastal areas and earthquake exposure mainly in California and the Pacific Northwest may prevent the Company from insuring some of its facilities to full replacement value.
With respect to operations in South Africa, the United Kingdom and Australia, we utilize a combination of locally procured insurance and global policies to meet contractual insurance requirements and protect us. In addition to these policies, our Australian subsidiary carries tail insurance on a general liability policy related to a discontinued contract.
Of the insurance policies discussed above, our most significant insurance reserves relate to workers’ compensation, general liability and auto claims. These reserves are undiscounted and were $78.9 million and $68.2 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively and are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheets. We use statistical and actuarial methods to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as historical frequency and severity of claims at each of our facilities, claim development, payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services and unpredictability of the size of jury awards. We also may experience variability between our estimates and the actual settlement due to limitations inherent in the estimation process, including our ability to estimate costs of processing and settling claims in a timely manner as well as our ability to accurately estimate our exposure at the onset of a claim. Because we have high deductible insurance policies, the amount of our insurance expense is dependent on our ability to control our claims experience. If actual losses related to insurance claims significantly differ from our estimates, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted.
Income Taxes
The consolidated financial statements reflect provisions for federal, state, local and foreign income taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized as income in the period that includes the enactment date. Refer to Note 16- Income Taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Effective January 1, 2013, as a REIT that is required to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders, we do not expect to pay federal income taxes at the REIT level (including our qualified REIT subsidiaries), as the resulting dividends paid deduction will generally offset our taxable income. Since we do not expect to pay taxes on our REIT taxable income, we do not expect to be able to recognize such deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws. Significant judgments are required to determine the consolidated provision for income taxes. Deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year. Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon many factors such as tax regulations applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate, estimates of future taxable income and the character of such taxable income.
Additionally, we must use significant judgment in addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations. If actual circumstances differ from our assumptions, adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets or liabilities may be required, which may result in an adverse impact on the results of our operations and our effective tax rate. Valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the “more likely than not” criteria. We have not made any significant changes to the way we account for our deferred tax assets and liabilities in any year presented in the consolidated financial statements. Based on our estimate of future earnings and our favorable earnings history, we currently expect full realization of the deferred tax assets net of any recorded valuation allowances. Furthermore, tax positions taken by us may not be fully sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. In determining the adequacy of our provision
(benefit) for income taxes, potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations are regularly assessed. As such, the final outcome of tax examinations, including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues, cannot be estimated with certainty.
Asset Impairments
We had property and equipment, net of $2.1 billion and $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, including approximately 990 vacant beds with a net book value of approximately $24 million at December 31, 2020 at two of our idle facilities in the Secure Services segment that we are currently marketing to potential customers. Also, in our GEO Care segment, we are currently marketing approximately 1,100 vacant beds with a net book value of approximately $26 million at December 31, 2020 at two of our idle facilities to potential customers.
We review long-lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Events that would trigger an impairment assessment include deterioration of profits for a business segment that has long-lived assets, or when other changes occur that might impair recovery of long-lived assets such as the termination of a management contract or a significant decrease in population. If impairment indicators are present, we perform a recoverability test to determine whether or not an impairment loss should be measured.
We test idle facilities for impairment upon notification that the facilities will no longer be utilized by the customer. If a long-lived asset is part of a group that includes other assets, the unit of accounting for the long-lived asset is its group. Generally, we group assets by facility for the purpose of considering whether any impairment exists. The estimates of recoverability are based on projected undiscounted cash flows associated with actual marketing efforts where available or, in other instances, projected undiscounted cash flows that are comparable to historical cash flows from management contracts at similar facilities and sensitivity analyses that consider reductions to such cash flows. Our sensitivity analyses include adjustments to projected cash flows compared to the historical cash flows due to current business conditions which impact per diem rates as well as labor and other operating costs, changes related to facility mission due to changes in prospective clients, and changes in projected capacity and occupancy rates. We also factor in prolonged periods of vacancies as well as the time and costs required to ramp up facility population once a contract is obtained. We perform the impairment analyses on an annual basis for each of the idle facilities and update each quarter for market developments for the potential utilization of each of the facilities in order to identify events that may cause us to reconsider the most recent assumptions. Such events could include negotiations with a prospective customer for the utilization of an idle facility at terms significantly less favorable than used in our most recent impairment analysis, or changes in legislation surrounding a particular facility that could impact our ability to house certain types of individuals at such facility. Further, a substantial increase in the number of available beds at other facilities that we own, or in the marketplace, could lead to deterioration in market conditions and projected cash flows. Although they are not frequently received, an unsolicited offer to purchase any of our idle facilities, at amounts that are less than their carrying value could also cause us to reconsider the assumptions used in the most recent impairment analysis. We have identified marketing prospects to utilize each of the remaining currently idled facilities and do not see any catalysts that would result in a current impairment. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to secure management contracts to utilize our idle facilities, or that we will not incur impairment charges in the future. In all cases, except for one of our leased facilities, the projected undiscounted cash flows in our analysis as of December 31, 2020 substantially exceeded the carrying amounts of each facility. With respect to the leased facility where the carrying amount of the facility did not exceed the projected undiscounted cash flows, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $5.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Our evaluations also take into consideration historical experience in securing new management contracts to utilize facilities that had been previously idled for periods comparable to or in excess of the periods our currently idle facilities have been idle. Such previously idled facilities are currently being operated under contracts that generate cash flows resulting in the recoverability of the net book value of the previously idled facilities by substantial amounts. Due to a variety of factors, the lead time to negotiate contracts with federal and state agencies to utilize idle bed capacity is generally lengthy which has historically resulted in periods of idleness similar to the ones we are currently experiencing. As a result of our analyses, we determined each of these assets to have recoverable values substantially in excess of the corresponding carrying values.
By their nature, these estimates contain uncertainties with respect to the extent and timing of the respective cash flows due to potential delays or material changes to forecasted terms and conditions in contracts with prospective customers that could impact the estimate of projected cash flows.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Net
Goodwill
We have recorded goodwill as a result of our business combinations. Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible assets and other intangible assets acquired. Our goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth quarter, and whenever events or circumstances arise that indicate impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is performed for all reporting units that contain goodwill. The reporting units are
the same as the reportable segment for U.S. Secure Services and are at the operating segment level for GEO Care. On the annual measurement date of October 1, 2020, management elected to qualitatively assess the Company's goodwill for impairment for all of its reporting units except for its community based reporting unit which was assessed using a quantitative analysis. Under provisions of the qualitative analysis, when testing goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we performs a quantitative impairment test to identify goodwill impairment and measures the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized, if any. The qualitative factors used by management to determine the likelihood that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount include, among other things, a review of overall economic conditions and their current and future impact on our existing business, our financial performance and stock price, industry outlook and market competition. With respect to the qualitative assessments, management determined that, as of October 1, 2020, it was more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values. With respect to the quantitative analysis performed, we used a third-party valuation firm to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model. A discount rate of 10% was utilized to adjust the cash flow forecasts based on our estimate of a market participant’s weighted-average cost of capital. Growth rates for sales and profits were determined using inputs from our long-term planning process. We also make estimates for discount rates and other factors based on market conditions, historical experience and other economic factors. Changes in these factors could significantly impact the fair value of the reporting unit. With respect to the community based reporting unit that was assessed quantitatively, management determined that the carrying value exceeded its fair value due to future declines in cash flow projections primarily due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the our reentry facilities. As such, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $21.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. A change in one or combination of the assumptions discussed above could impact the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly or other economic conditions deteriorate, goodwill may be further impaired. See Note 8 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further information.
Other Intangible Assets. Net
We have also recorded other finite and indefinite lived intangible assets as a result of previously completed business combinations. Other acquired finite and indefinite lived intangible assets are recognized separately if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, regardless of our intent to do so. Our intangible assets include facility management contracts, trade names and technology. The facility management contracts represent customer relationships in the form of management contracts acquired at the time of each business combination; the value of BI’s and Protocol Criminal Justice, Inc.'s (“Protocol”) trade names represent, among other intangible benefits, name recognition to its customers and intellectual property rights; and the acquired technology represents BI’s innovation with respect to its GPS tracking, monitoring, radio frequency monitoring, voice verification monitoring and alcohol compliance systems, Protocol's innovation with respect to its customer relationship management software and Soberlink, Inc.'s innovation with respect to its alcohol monitoring devices. When establishing useful lives, we consider the period and the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up; or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method over a period that may be shorter than the ultimate life of such intangible asset. We also consider the impact of renewal terms when establishing useful lives. We currently amortize our acquired facility management contracts over periods ranging from three to twenty-one years and our acquired technology over seven years to eight years. There is no residual value associated with our finite-lived intangible assets. We review our trade name assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. We do not amortize our indefinite lived intangible assets. We review our indefinite lived intangible assets annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. These reviews resulted in no impairment to the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible assets for all periods presented. We record the costs associated with renewal and extension of facility management contracts as expenses in the period they are incurred.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company implemented the following accounting standards during the year ended December 31, 2020:
The SEC recently adopted the final rule in Release No. 33-10762 (the “Final Rule”), Financial Disclosures about Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities and Affiliates Whose Securities Collateralize a Registrant’s Securities, to eliminate certain prescriptive requirements currently in Rules 3-10 and 3-16 of Regulation S-X. The Final Rule amends Regulation S-X Rules 3-10 and 3-16 with Regulation S-X Rules 13-01, Guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities registered or being registered, and 13-02, Affiliates whose securities collateralize securities registered or being registered. The Final Rule simplifies the conditions required to omit separate financial statements of subsidiary issuers and guarantors, allows for reduced supplemental financial information about subsidiary issuers and guarantors as well as affiliates whose securities are collateralized and expands qualitative disclosures about the guarantees or securities pledged as collateral as well as issuers, guarantors, or affiliates, as applicable. The amended rules also provide flexibility to include these disclosures within or outside the annual and interim financial statements in both registration statements and periodic reports. Further, the disclosures are required only for the most recent annual and year-to-date interim periods. The Final Rule is effective on January 4, 2021 with early adoption permitted. The early adoption of the Final Rule did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, "Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)" as a part of its disclosure framework project. The amendments in this update remove, modify and add certain disclosures primarily related to transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, various disclosures related to Level 3 fair value measurements and investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value. The new standard was effective for us beginning January 1, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASC No. 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments". The purpose of Update No. 2016-13 is to replace the current incurred loss impairment methodology for financial assets measured at amortized cost with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information, including forecasted information, to develop credit loss estimates. Update No. 2016-13 was effective for us beginning January 1, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
The following accounting standards will be adopted in future periods:
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, “Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options”. The guidance in this update simplifies the accounting for convertible debt and convertible preferred stock by removing the requirements to separately present certain conversion features in equity. In addition, the amendments in the ASU also simplify the guidance in ASC 815-40, “Derivatives and Hedging: Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity” by removing certain criteria that must be satisfied in order to classify a contract as equity, which is expected to decrease the number of freestanding instruments and embedded derivatives accounted for as assets or liabilities. Finally, the amendments revise the guidance on calculating earnings per share, requiring use of the if-converted method for all convertible instruments and rescinding an entity’s ability to rebut the presumption of share settlement for instruments that may be settled in cash or shares. The new standard is effective for us beginning January 1, 2022. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Reform Rate (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,” to provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the contract modifications, hedge relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. This ASU, which was effective upon issuance and may be applied through December 31, 2022, is applicable to all contracts and hedging relationships that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate or any other reference rate expected to be discontinued. We are currently evaluating the impact of reference rate reform and the potential application of this guidance.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, "Compensation-Retirement Benefits-Defined Benefit Plans-General (Topic 715.20)" as a part of its disclosure framework project. The amendments in this update remove, modify and add certain disclosures primarily related to amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year, explanations for reasons for significant gains and losses related to changes in the benefit obligation for the period, and projected and accumulated benefit obligations. The new standard is effective for us beginning January 1, 2021. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the SEC did not, or are not expected to, have a material effect on the Company's results of operations or financial position.
Results of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements accompanying this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those described under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and those included in other portions of this report.
2020 versus 2019
Revenues
U.S. Secure Services
Revenues decreased in 2020 by $30.5 million compared to 2019 as a result of $36.5 million primarily due to net decreases in populations at our ICE processing centers and USMS facilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in declines in crossings and apprehensions along the Southwest border, as well as decreases in court sentencing at the federal levels. Additionally, revenues decreased by $66.1 million due to the discontinuation of our California Modified Community Correctional Facility contracts along with other contract discontinuations. Various governmental agencies have also taken steps to decrease the number of those in custody to adhere to social distancing protocols. We also experienced net decreases in population, transportation services and/or rates of $3.7 million at our BOP and state facilities. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $75.8 million resulting from the activation of our contracts at our company-owned and previously idled South Louisiana Processing Center in Basile, Louisiana during the third quarter of 2019, our company-owned and previously idled North Lake Correctional Facility in Baldwin, Michigan which was activated on October 1, 2019, our managed-only contract for the El Centro Detention Center in California which was effective in December 2019, the activation of our company-owned Golden State Annex facility in California which was effective in September 2020 as well as the activation of the county-owned Reeves County Detention Center I & II in the third quarter of 2019.
The number of compensated mandays in GEO Secure Services facilities was approximately 21.7 million in 2020 and 23.5 million in 2019. We experienced an aggregate net decrease of approximately 1,800,000 mandays as a result of net decreases in population as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as contract terminations, partially offset by contract activations discussed above. We look at the average occupancy in our facilities to determine how we are managing our available beds. The average occupancy is calculated by taking compensated mandays as a percentage of capacity. The average occupancy in our GEO Secure Services facilities was 89.3% and 94.9% of capacity in 2020 and 2019, respectively, excluding idle facilities.
GEO Care
Revenues decreased in 2020 by $62.9 million compared to 2019 primarily due to aggregate decreases of $42.4 million related to contract discontinuations/closures of underutilized facilities which have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors. We also experienced a decrease of $14.1 million due to decreases in blended rates and average client and participant counts under our ISAP services as a result of policy changes by the former administration. Also contributing to this decrease were the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our community based programs which resulted in reductions in home visits and other impacts. In addition, we experienced decreases of $12.3 million related to net decreases in census levels at certain of our community-based and reentry centers due to declines in programs as a result of lower levels of referrals by federal, state and local agencies primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $5.9 million due to new/reactivated contracts and programs.
International Services
Revenues for International Services decreased by $20.4 million in 2020 compared to 2019. We experienced a net decrease of $15.7 million which was primarily due to the transition of the Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre to government operation in State of Queensland, Australia at the end of June 2020. Additionally, we experienced decreases of $4.7 million due to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
Facility Construction & Design
In 2020 and 2019, we had facility construction & design services related to an expansion project at our Fulham Correctional Centre in Australia which was substantially completed in the third quarter of 2020. The revenue decrease was due to a decrease in construction activity as the project neared completion.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses consist of those expenses incurred in the operation and management of our Secure Services, GEO Care and International Services facilities and expenses incurred in our Facility Construction & Design segment.
U.S. Secure Services
Operating expenses for U.S. Secure Services decreased by $8.6 million in 2020 compared to 2019. We experienced decreases of $31.5 million at certain of our facilities primarily due to contract discontinuations. Additionally, we experienced aggregate net decreases of $27.6 million related to decreases in population, transportation services and the variable costs associated with those services primarily as a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic as described above. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $50.5 million from the activation of our contracts at our company-owned and previously idled South Louisiana Processing Center in Basile, Louisiana during the third quarter of 2019, our company-owned and previously idled North Lake Correctional Facility in Baldwin, Michigan which was activated on October 1, 2019, our managed-only contract for the El Centro Detention Center in California which was effective in December 2019 as well as activation of our company-owned Golden State Annex facility in California which was effective in September 2020.
GEO Care
Operating expenses for GEO Care decreased by $36.4 million during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to net decreases of $30.2 million from contract discontinuations/closures of underutilized facilities. We also experienced a decrease of $8.6 million due to decreases in average client and participant counts under our ISAP services as a result of policy changes by the administration which reduced the number of enrollments at the southern border. Also contributing to this decrease were the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in reductions in home visits and other impacts. Additionally, we experienced $3.4 million of net decreases related to census levels at certain of our community-based reentry centers and day reporting centers due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $5.8 million due to new/reactivated contracts and programs and day reporting center openings.
International Services
Operating expenses for International Services decreased by $23.4 million in 2020 compared to 2019. We experienced a net decrease of $18.7 million which was primarily due to the transition of the Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre to government operation in State of Queensland, Australia at the end of June 2020. Additionally, we experienced decreases of $4.7 million due to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
Facility Construction & Design
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018 and into 2019, we had facility construction & design services related to an expansion project at our Fulham Correctional Centre in Australia which was substantially completed in the third quarter of 2020. The decrease in operating expenses was due to a decrease in construction activity as the project neared completion.
Depreciation and Amortization
U.S. Secure Services
U.S. Secure Services depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to renovations in connection with our contract activations at certain of our company-owned facilities as previously discussed.
GEO Care
GEO Care depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to renovations at certain of our centers.
International Services
Depreciation and amortization expense increased slightly in 2020 compared to 2019 as a result of renovations during 2019 and 2020 at several of our international facilities.

General and administrative expenses comprise substantially all of our other unallocated operating expenses which primarily includes corporate management salaries and benefits, professional fees and other administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expense of $1.6 million, $2.5 million in insurance expense associated with policy renewals as well as normal personnel and compensation adjustments, professional, consulting, business development and other administrative expenses including COVID-19 related expenses. These increases were partially offset by less travel, marketing and other corporate administrative expenses primarily due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In connection with our annual goodwill testing, we determined that the carrying value of our community based reporting unit exceeded its fair value as a result of future declines in cash flow projections primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $21.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 1 - Summary of Business Organization, Operations and Significant Accounting Policies - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
Non-Operating Income and Expense
Interest Income and Interest Expense
Interest income decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to our contract receivable balance for our facility in Ravenhall, Australia.
Interest expense decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower interest rates on our variable rate debt. Also contributing to the decrease was a reduction in higher interest rate debt balances. During 2019, we repurchased approximately $56.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.875% Senior Notes due 2022. During 2020, we repurchased approximately $7.5 million in aggregate principal amount
of its 5.875% Senior Notes due 2024. Additionally, during 2020, we repurchased approximately $18.2 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.125% Senior Notes due 2023. Refer to Note 12- Debt of the Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

During 2020, we repurchased approximately $7.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5.875% Senior Notes due 2024 at a weighted average price of $78.99 for a total cost of $5.8 million. Additionally, during 2020, we repurchased approximately $18.2 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5.125% Senior Notes due 2023 at a weighted average price of $77.28 for a total cost of $14.4 million. As a result of these repurchase, we incurred a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $5.3 million.
On May 22, 2019, we completed an offering of non-recourse notes related to our Ravenhall facility in Australia. The net proceeds from this offering were used to refinance our outstanding construction facility. As a result of the transaction, we incurred a $4.5 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to swap termination fees and unamortized deferred loan costs associated with the Construction Facility. Additionally, on June 12, 2019, GEO entered into Amendment No. 2 to our credit agreement. Under the amendment, the maturity date of our Revolver has been extended to May 17, 2024. As a result of the amendment, we incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.2 million related to certain unamortized deferred loan costs.
Additionally, during 2019, we repurchased approximately $56 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5.875% Senior Notes due 2022 at a weighted average price of 97.55% for a total cost of $54.7 million. As the result of the repurchases we recognized a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $0.9 million which partially offset the loss discussed above.

The provision for income taxes in 2020 increased compared to 2019 along with the effective tax rate which is due to a change in the composition of our income between our REIT and TRS subsidiaries and certain non-recurring items. In 2020, there was a $4.2 million discrete tax expense, inclusive of a $3.6 million discrete tax expense related to stock compensation that vested during the period. In contrast, in 2019, there was a $0.5 million discrete tax benefit, net of a $0.2 million discrete tax expense related to stock compensation that vested during the period. Furthermore, the effective tax rate increased as a result of the impairment, which is not deductible for tax purposes. As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to shareholders and in turn are allowed a deduction for the distribution at the REIT level. Our wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiaries continue to be fully subject to federal, state and foreign income taxes, as applicable. We estimate our 2021 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of approximately 15% to 18% exclusive of any discrete items.

Equity in earnings of affiliates, presented net of income taxes, represents the earnings of SACS and GEOAmey in the aggregate. Equity in earnings of affiliates in 2020 compared to 2019 decreased slightly primarily due to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
Financial Condition
Capital Requirements
Our current cash requirements consist of amounts needed for working capital, distributions of our REIT taxable income in order to maintain our REIT qualification under the Code, debt service, supply purchases, investments in joint ventures, and capital expenditures related
to either the development of new secure, processing and reentry facilities, or the maintenance of existing facilities. In addition, some of our management contracts require us to make substantial initial expenditures of cash in connection with opening or renovating a facility. Generally, these initial expenditures are subsequently fully or partially recoverable as pass-through costs or are billable as a component of the per diem rates or monthly fixed fees to the contracting agency over the original term of the contract. Additional capital needs may also arise in the future with respect to possible acquisitions, other corporate transactions or other corporate purposes.
As of December 31, 2020, we were developing a number of projects that we estimate will cost approximately $54.5 million, of which $35.0 million was spent through December 31, 2020. We estimate our remaining capital requirements to be approximately $19.5 million. These projects are expected to be completed through 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
On June 12, 2019, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") by and among the refinancing lenders party thereto, the other lenders party thereto, GEO and GEO Corrections Holdings, Inc. and the administrative agent. Under the amendment, the maturity date of the revolver component of the Credit Agreement has been extended to May 17, 2024. The borrowing capacity under the amended revolver will remain at $900 million, and its pricing will remain unchanged, currently bearing interest at LIBOR plus 2.25%. As a result of the transaction, we incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.2 million related to certain unamortized deferred loan costs. Additionally, loan costs of $4.7 million were incurred and capitalized in connection with the transaction.
A syndicate of approximately 65 lenders participate in our Credit Agreement, six of which have indicated that they do not intend to provide new financing to GEO but will honor their existing obligations (Refer to Item 1A - Risk Factors included in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on certain financial institutions who announced beginning in 2019 that they will not be renewing existing agreements or entering into new agreements with companies that privately operate secure correctional facilities, processing centers and community reentry centers under public-private partnerships). Certain lenders have also publicly disclosed that they will no longer loan money to one of our key competitors. The banks that have withdrawn participation remain contractually committed for approximately three years. These six banks represent 54% of the lending commitments under the revolver component of our senior credit facility as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, these six banks represent less than 25% of our overall borrowing capacity under our Credit Agreement and the withdrawal of their participation is not expected to negatively impact our financial flexibility. We are also in frequent communication with potential new lenders as well as the credit rating agencies who have not changed our credit ratings for over 45 months.
The Credit Agreement evidences a credit facility (the "Credit Facility") consisting of the $792.0 million term loan discussed above (the "Term Loan") bearing interest at LIBOR plus 2.00% (with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%), and a $900.0 million revolver initially bearing interest at LIBOR plus 2.25% (with no LIBOR floor) together with AUD275 million available solely for the issuance of financial letters of credit and performance letters of credit, in each case denominated in Australian Dollars under the Australian Dollar Letter of Credit Facility (the "Australian LC Facility"). As of December 31, 2020, there were no letters of credit issued under the Australian LC Facility. Amounts to be borrowed by GEO under the Credit Agreement are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions to borrowing. The Term Loan component is scheduled to mature on March 23, 2024. The revolving credit commitment component is scheduled to mature on May 17, 2024. The Credit Agreement also has an accordion feature of $450.0 million, subject to lender demand and prevailing market conditions and satisfying the relevant borrowing conditions.
The Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, and certain customary covenants that restrict GEO’s ability to, among other things (i) create, incur or assume any indebtedness, (ii) create, incur, assume or permit liens, (iii) make loans and investments, (iv) engage in mergers, acquisitions and asset sales, (v) make certain restricted payments, (vi) issue, sell or otherwise dispose of capital stock, (vii) engage in transactions with affiliates, (viii) allow the total leverage ratio to exceed 6.25 to 1.00, allow the senior secured leverage ratio to exceed 3.50 to 1.00, or allow the interest coverage ratio to be less than 3.00 to 1.00, (ix) cancel, forgive, make any voluntary or optional payment or prepayment on, or redeem or acquire for value any senior notes, except as permitted, (x) alter the business GEO conducts, and (xi) materially impair GEO’s lenders’ security interests in the collateral for its loans.
Events of default under the Credit Agreement include, but are not limited to, (i) GEO’s failure to pay principal or interest when due, (ii) GEO’s material breach of any representation or warranty, (iii) covenant defaults, (iv) liquidation, reorganization or other relief relating to bankruptcy or insolvency, (v) cross default under certain other material indebtedness, (vi) unsatisfied final judgments over a specified threshold, (vii) certain material environmental liability claims asserted against GEO, and (viii) a change in control.
All of the obligations under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries of GEO and the Credit Agreement and the related guarantees are secured by a perfected first-priority pledge of substantially all of GEO’s present and future tangible and intangible domestic assets and all present and future tangible and intangible domestic assets of each guarantor, including but not limited to a first-priority pledge of all of the outstanding capital stock owned by GEO and each guarantor in their domestic subsidiaries.
The Australian borrowers are wholly owned foreign subsidiaries of GEO. GEO has designated each of the Australian borrowers as restricted subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement. However, the Australian borrowers are not obligated to pay or perform any obligations under the Credit Agreement other than their own obligations as Australian borrowers under the Credit Agreement. The Australian borrowers do not pledge any of their assets to secure any obligations under the Credit Agreement.
On August 18, 2016, we executed a Letter of Offer by and among GEO and HSBC Bank Australia Limited (the “Letter of Offer”) providing for a bank guarantee line and bank guarantee/standby sub-facility in an aggregate amount of AUD100 million, or $77.1 million, based on exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2020 (collectively, the “Bank Guarantee Facility”). The Bank Guarantee Facility allows GEO to provide letters of credit to assure performance of certain obligations of its wholly owned subsidiary relating to its secure facility project in Ravenhall, located near Melbourne, Australia. In accordance with the Ravenhall Contract, upon the completion of a certain period of operations, the Bank Guarantee Facility was reduced during the fourth quarter of 2019 to approximately AUD59 million, or $45.5 million, based on exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2020. The Bank Guarantee Facility is unsecured. The issuance of letters of credit under the Bank Guarantee Facility is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent specified in the Letter of Offer. Letters of credit issued under the bank guarantee lines are due on demand and letters of credit issued under the bank guarantee/standby sub-facility cannot have a duration exceeding twelve months. The Bank Guarantee Facility may be terminated by HSBC Bank Australia Limited on 90 days written notice. As of December 31, 2020, there was AUD59 million in letters of credit issued under the Bank Guarantee Facility.
As of December 31, 2020, we had $770.0 million in aggregate borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan, $704.4 million in borrowings under the Revolver, and approximately $59.6 million in letters of credit which left $136.0 million in additional borrowing capacity under the Revolver. In addition, we have the ability to increase the Senior Credit Facility by an additional $450.0 million, subject to lender demand and prevailing market conditions and satisfying the relevant borrowing conditions thereunder. Refer to Note 12 - Debt in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
6.00% Senior Notes due 2026
On April 18, 2016, we completed an offering of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% senior notes due 2026. The 6.00% Senior Notes will mature on April 15, 2026 and were issued at a coupon rate and yield to maturity of 6.00%. Interest on the 6.00% Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on October 15, 2016. We used the net proceeds to fund the tender offer and the redemption of all of our 6.625% Senior Notes, to pay all related fees, costs and expenses and for general corporate purposes including repaying borrowings under our prior revolver. Loan costs of approximately $6 million were incurred and capitalized in connection with the offering. Refer to Note 12 - Debt in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
5.875% Senior Notes due 2024
On September 25, 2014, we completed an offering of $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. The notes will mature on October 15, 2024 and have a coupon rate and yield to maturity of 5.875%. Interest is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on April 15 and October 15, which commenced on April 15, 2015. The proceeds received from the 5.875% Senior Notes due 2024 were used to pay down a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the revolver portion of our prior Senior Credit Facility. Refer to Note 12 - Debt in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
5.875% Senior Notes due 2022
On October 3, 2013, we completed an offering of $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2022. The 5.875% Senior Notes due 2022 will mature on January 15, 2022 and have a coupon rate and yield to maturity of 5.875%. Interest is payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 each year, which commenced on January 15, 2014. The proceeds received from the 5.875% Senior Notes due 2022 were used, together with cash on hand, to fund the repurchase, redemption or other discharge of our 7 3/4% Senior Notes due 2017 and to pay related transaction fees and expenses. Refer to Note 12 - Debt in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
5.125% Senior Notes due 2023
On March 19, 2013, we completed an offering of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% Senior Notes. The 5.125% Senior Notes will mature on April 1, 2023 and have a coupon rate and yield to maturity of 5.125%. Interest is payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 each year, which commenced on October 1, 2013. A portion of the proceeds received from the 5.125% Senior Notes were used on the date of the financing to repay the prior revolver credit draws outstanding under the prior senior credit facility. Refer to Note 12 - Debt in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Debt Repurchases
On August 16, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase and/or retire a portion of the 6.00% Senior Notes due 2026, the 5.875% Senior Notes due 2024, the 5.125% Senior Notes due 2023, the 5.875% Senior Notes due 2022 (collectively the "GEO Senior Notes") and our term loan under its Amended Credit Agreement through cash purchases, in open market, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise, up to an aggregate maximum of $100.0 million, subject to certain limitations through December 31, 2020. On February 11, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for repurchases/retirements of the above referenced Senior Notes and term loan, subject to certain limitations up to an aggregate maximum of $100.0 million through December 31, 2022.
During 2020, the Company repurchased approximately $7.5 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.875% Senior Notes due 2024 at a weighted average price of 77.28% for a total cost of $5.8 million. Additionally, during 2020, the Company repurchased approximately $18.2 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.125% Senior Notes due 2023 at a weighted average price of 78.99% for a total cost of $14.3 million. As a result of these repurchases, the Company recognized a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $5.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.
During 2019, the Company repurchased approximately $56.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.875% Senior Notes due 2022 at a weighted average price of 97.55% for a total cost of $54.7 million. As a result of these repurchases, the Company recognized a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.
There can be no assurance that any future refinancing would be available to us on terms equal to or more favorable than our current financing terms, or at all. In the future, our access to capital and ability to compete for future capital-intensive projects will also be dependent upon, among other things, our ability to meet certain financial covenants in the indentures governing the 6.00% Senior Notes, the 5.125% Senior Notes, the 5.875% Senior Notes due 2022 and the 5.875% Senior Notes due 2024 and our Senior Credit Facility. A substantial decline in our financial performance could limit our access to capital pursuant to these covenants and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources and, as a result, on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition to these foregoing potential constraints on our capital, a number of state government agencies have been suffering from budget deficits and liquidity issues. While we expect to be in compliance with our debt covenants, if these constraints were to intensify, our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted as could our ability to remain in compliance with these debt covenants.
We may from time to time seek to purchase or retire our outstanding senior notes through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.
Senior Credit Facility
On November 6, 2020, out of an abundance of caution and as a liquidity management strategy, GEO elected to draw down $250 million in borrowings under its credit facility. In order to maintain maximum financial flexibility, GEO plans to maintain this liquidity on hand.
Quarterly Dividends
In October 2020, the GEO Board of Directors decided to reduce GEO’s quarterly cash dividend beginning with the quarterly dividend paid on October 23, 2020 from $0.48 per share, or $1.92 per share annualized, to $0.34 per share, or $1.36 per share annualized. The GEO Board of Directors took this action based on a determination that it is in the best interests of GEO and our shareholders to apply excess cash flow to debt reduction. In January 2021, the GEO Board of Directors decided to further reduce GEO’s quarterly cash dividend beginning with the quarterly dividend paid on February 1, 2021 from $0.34 per share, or $1.36 per share annualized, to $0.25 per share, or $1.00 per share annualized. The reduction of GEO’s quarterly dividend payment will allow GEO to continue its focus on paying down debt and to balance its continued creation of value for GEO shareholders with prudent management of its balance sheet. The GEO Board of Directors will continue to evaluate GEO’s dividend policy and capital allocation. The declaration of future quarterly cash dividends is subject to approval by the GEO Board of Directors and to meeting the requirements of all applicable laws and regulations. The GEO Board of Directors retains the power to modify or eliminate GEO’s quarterly dividend as it may deem necessary or appropriate in the future to consider factors including, but not limited to, long-term capital needs and access to the capital markets.
Stock Buyback Program
On February 14, 2018, we announced that our Board authorized a stock buyback program authorizing us to repurchase up to a maximum of $200 million of our shares of common stock. The stock buyback program was funded primarily with cash on hand, free cash flow and borrowings under our $900 million revolving credit facility. The program expired on October 20, 2020. The stock buyback program was intended to be implemented through purchases made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") requirements. The stock buyback program did not obligate us to purchase any
specific amount of our common stock and could have been suspended or extended at any time at the discretion of our Board. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we purchased 553,665 shares of our common stock at a cost of $9.0 million primarily purchased with proceeds from our Revolver. There were no purchases of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we purchased 4,210,254 shares of our common stock at a cost of $95.2 million primarily purchased with proceeds from our Revolver.
Automatic Shelf Registration on Form S-3
On October 30, 2020, the Company filed an automatic shelf registration on Form S-3 with the SEC that enables the Company to offer for sale, from time to time and as the capital markets permit, an unspecified amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, guarantees of debt securities, warrants and units. Each time the Company offers to sell securities, the Company will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of that offering and the securities being offered. The shelf registration statement is automatically effective and is valid for three years.
REIT Distributions
As a REIT, we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our shareholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for dividends paid and by excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we expect to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income so as not to be subject to the income or excise tax on undistributed REIT taxable income. The amount, timing and frequency of distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will be based upon various factors.
We plan to fund all of our capital needs, including distributions of our REIT taxable income in order to maintain our REIT qualification, and capital expenditures, from cash on hand, cash from operations, borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility and any other financings which our management and Board of Directors, in their discretion, may consummate. Currently, our primary source of liquidity to meet these requirements is cash flow from operations and borrowings under the $900.0 million Revolver. Our management believes that cash on hand, cash flows from operations and availability under our Senior Credit Facility will be adequate to support our capital requirements for 2021 as disclosed under “Capital Requirements” above.
Non-Recourse Debt
Northwest ICE Processing Center
On December 9, 2011, the Washington Economic Development Finance Authority issued $54.4 million of its Washington Economic Development Finance Authority Taxable Economic Development Revenue Bonds, series 2011 (“2011 Revenue Bonds”). The payment of principal and interest on the bonds is non-recourse to us. None of the bonds nor CSC of Tacoma, LLC’s (“CSC”) obligations under the loan are our obligations nor are they guaranteed by us.
As of December 31, 2020, the remaining balance of the debt service requirement related to the 2011 Revenue Bonds is $8.1 million, all of which is classified as current in the accompanying balance sheet. As of December 31, 2020, included in restricted cash and investments is $3.7 million (all current) of funds held in trust with respect to the Northwest ICE Processing Center for debt service and other reserves which had not been released to us as of December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 12-Debt in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
Australia - Ravenhall
In connection with a design and build facility project agreement with the State of Victoria, in September 2014 we entered into a syndicated facility agreement (the "Construction Facility") to provide debt financing for construction of the project. Refer to Note 6 - Contract Receivable in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Construction Facility provided for non-recourse funding up to AUD 791 million, or $609.8 million, based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2020. Construction draws were funded throughout the project according to a fixed utilization schedule as defined in the syndicated facility agreement. The term of the Construction Facility was through September 2019 and bore interest at a variable rate quoted by certain Australian banks plus 200 basis points. On May 22, 2019, we completed an offering of AUD 461.6 million, or $355.9 million, based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2020, aggregate principal amount of non-recourse senior secured notes due 2042 (the "Non-Recourse Notes"). The amortizing Non-Recourse Notes were issued by Ravenhall Finance Co Pty Limited in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Non-Recourse Notes were issued with a coupon and yield to maturity of 4.23% with a maturity date of March 31, 2042. The net proceeds from this offering were used to refinance the outstanding Construction Facility and to pay all related fees, costs and expenses associated with the transaction. As a result of the transaction, we incurred a $4.5 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to swap termination fees and unamortized deferred loan costs associated with the Construction Facility. Additionally, loan costs of approximately $7.5 million were incurred and capitalized in connection with the offering. Refer to Note 7 - Derivative Financial Instruments in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Other
In August 2019, we entered into two identical Notes (as defined below) in the aggregate amount of $44.3 million which are secured by loan agreements and mortgage and security agreements on certain real property and improvements. The terms of the Notes are through September 1, 2034 and bear interest at LIBOR plus 200 basis points and are payable in monthly installments plus interest. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rate to 4.22%. Included in the balance at December 31, 2020 is $0.7 million of deferred loan costs incurred in the transaction. Refer to Note 7 - Derivative Financial Instruments in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Guarantees
The Company has entered into certain guarantees in connection with the design, financing and construction of certain facilities as well as loan, working capital and other obligation guarantees for our subsidiaries in Australia, South Africa and our joint ventures. Refer to Note 12 - Debt in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Executive Retirement Agreement
We have a non-qualified deferred compensation agreement with our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). The agreement provides for a lump sum payment upon retirement, no sooner than age 55. As of December 31, 2020, the CEO had reached age 55 and was eligible to receive the payment upon retirement. If the Company’s CEO had retired as of December 31, 2020, the Company would have had to pay him approximately $8.9 million in shares of the Company’s common stock (determined as of February 26, 2020) plus additional shares credited for dividends declared and paid on the shares of the Company’s common stock as further discussed below.
On February 26, 2020 (the "Effective Date"), we and our CEO entered into an amended and restated executive retirement agreement that amends the CEO’s executive retirement agreement discussed above.
The amended and restated executive retirement agreement provides that upon the CEO’s retirement from GEO, we will pay a lump sum amount equal to $8,925,065 (determined as of February 26, 2020) (the “Grandfathered Payment”) which will be paid in the form of a fixed number of shares of our common stock. The Grandfathered Payment will be delayed for six months and a day following the effective date of the CEO’s termination of employment in compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
On the Effective Date, an amount equal to the Grandfathered Payment was invested in our common stock (“GEO Shares”). The number of our shares of common stock as of the Effective Date was equal to the Grandfathered Payment divided by the closing price of our common stock on the Effective Date (rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares), which equals 553,665 shares of our common stock. Additional shares of our common stock will be credited with a value equal to any dividends declared and paid on our shares of common stock, calculated by reference to the closing price of our common stock on the payment date for such dividends (rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares).
We have established several trusts for the purpose of paying the retirement benefit pursuant to the amended and restated executive retirement agreement. The trusts are revocable “rabbi trusts” and the assets of the trusts are subject to the claims of our creditors in the event of our insolvency.
Guarantor Financial Information
GEO’s 6.00% Senior Notes, 5.125% Senior Notes, the 5.875% Senior Notes due 2022 and the 5.875% Senior Notes due 2024 are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by certain of our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (the “Subsidiary Guarantors”).
Summarized financial information is provided for The GEO Group, Inc. (“Parent”) and the Subsidiary Guarantors on a combined basis in accordance with SEC Regulation S-X Rules 3-10 and 13-01. The accounting policies used in the preparation of this summarized financial information are consistent with those elsewhere in the condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company, except that intercompany transactions and balances of the Parent and Subsidiary Guarantor entities with non-guarantor entities have not been eliminated. Intercompany transactions between the Parent and Subsidiary Guarantors have been eliminated and equity in earnings from and investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries have not been presented.
Summarized statement of operations (in thousands):
Summarized balance sheets (in thousands):
(a)
Includes amounts due from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $26.7 million and $26.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
(b)
Includes amounts due to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $17.4 million and $17.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Except as discussed above, and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
We are also exposed to various commitments and contingencies which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. See Note 17 - Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Derivatives
In August 2019, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements in the aggregate notional amount of $44.3 million to fix the interest rate on certain of our variable rate debt to 4.22%. We have designated these interest rate swaps as hedges against changes in the cash flows of two identical promissory notes (the "Notes") which are secured by loan agreements and mortgage and security agreements on certain real property and improvements. We have determined that the swaps have payment, expiration dates, and provisions that coincide with the terms of the Notes and are therefore considered to be effective cash flow hedges. Accordingly, we record the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable taxes. Total unrealized losses recorded in total other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, related to these cash flow hedges was $4.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The total fair value of the swap liabilities as of December 31, 2020 was $6.0 million and is recorded as a component of Other Non-Current liabilities within the accompanying balance sheet. There was no material ineffectiveness for the period presented. We do not expect to enter into any transactions during the next twelve months which would result in reclassification into earnings or losses associated with these swaps currently reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Refer to Note 12 - Debt and Note 7 - Derivative Financial Instruments in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
Our Australian subsidiary entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rate on our variable rate non-recourse debt related to a project in Ravenhall, a locality near Melbourne, Australia to 4.2%. We determined that the swaps had payment, expiration dates, and provisions that coincided with the terms of the non-recourse debt and were therefore considered to be effective cash flow hedges. Accordingly, we recorded the change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable income taxes. On May 22, 2019, we refinanced the associated debt and terminated the swap agreements which resulted in the reclassification of $3.9 million into losses that were previously reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Refer to Note 12 - Debt and Note 7 - Derivative Financial Instruments in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
Contractual Obligations
The following is a table of certain of our contractual obligations, as of December 31, 2020, which requires us to make payments over the periods presented.
(a)
Due to the uncertainties of future LIBOR rates, the variable interest payments on our Senior Credit Facility were calculated using an average LIBOR rate of .33% based on projected interest rates through 2024.
Cash Flow
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020 was $311.9 million, compared to $67.5 million as of December 31, 2019 and was impacted by the following:
Net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 and 2019 was $441.7 million and $338.1 million, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 was positively impacted by non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, deferred tax provision, amortization of debt issuance costs, discount and/or premium and other non-cash interest, stock-based compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, goodwill impairment charges and dividends received from our unconsolidated joint venture. Equity in earnings of affiliates negatively impacted cash. Changes in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets decreased in total by a net of $68.2 million, representing a positive impact on cash. The decrease was primarily driven by the timing of billings and collections. Changes in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities increased by $57.3 million which positively impacted cash. The increase was primarily due to the timing of payments and also due to accruals for the deferral of the employer’s share of Social Security taxes of $42 million under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”). Refer to Note 17 - Commitments and Contingencies included in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Additionally, cash provided by operating activities in 2020 was positively impacted by a decrease in contract receivable of $5.2 million. The decrease relates to the timing of payments received and interest accrued, along with the effect of foreign exchange rates, related to the Ravenhall Project. Refer to Note 6 - Contract Receivable included in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was positively impacted by non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, deferred tax benefit, amortization of debt issuance costs, discount and/or premium and other non-cash interest, stock-based compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt and dividends received from our unconsolidated joint venture. Equity in earnings of affiliates negatively impacted cash. Changes in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets increased in total by a net of $8.4 million, representing a negative impact on cash. The increase was primarily driven by the timing of billings and collections. Changes in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities increased by $10.7 million which positively impacted cash. The increase was primarily due to the timing of payments. Additionally, cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was negatively impacted by an increase in contract receivable of $4.4 million. The increase relates to the timing of payments received and interest accrued, along with the effect of foreign exchange rates, related to the Ravenhall Project. Refer to Note 6 - Contract Receivable included in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Net cash used in investing activities of $104.2 million in 2020 was primarily the result of capital expenditures of $108.8 million, offset by insurance proceeds from damaged property primarily related to hurricanes of $9.5 million, proceeds from sale of assets held for sale of $2.4 million, proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $0.1 million and changes in restricted investments of $7.4 million. Net cash used in investing activities of $104.1 million in 2019 was primarily the result of capital expenditures of $117.2 million, offset by insurance proceeds
from damaged property primarily related to hurricanes of $19.3 million, proceeds from sale of assets held for sale of $0.8 million, proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $0.4 million and change in restricted investments of $7.4 million.
Net cash used in financing activities in 2020 reflects payments of $816.2 million on long term debt offset by $960.6 million of proceeds from long term debt and payments on non-recourse debt of $13.8 million. We also paid cash dividends of $216.1 million and purchased $9.0 million of shares of our common stock.
Net cash used in financing activities in 2019 reflects payments of $513.2 million on long term debt offset by $521.4 million of proceeds from long term debt and payments on non-recourse debt of $335.1 million offset by proceeds from non-recourse debt of $321.1 million. We also paid cash dividends of $232.5 million and debt issuance costs of $9.9 million.
Inflation
We believe that inflation, in general, did not have a material effect on our results of operations during 2020 and 2019. While some of our contracts include provisions for inflationary indexing, inflation could have a substantial adverse effect on our results of operations in the future to the extent that wages and salaries, which represent our largest recurring/fixed expense, increase at a faster rate than the per diem or fixed rates received by us for our management services.
Funds from Operations
Funds from Operations ("FFO") is a widely accepted supplemental non-GAAP measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies. It is defined in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which defines FFO as net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders (computed in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from the cumulative effects of accounting changes, extraordinary items and sales of properties, and including adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.
We also present Normalized Funds From Operations, or Normalized FFO, and Adjusted Funds from Operations, or AFFO, as supplemental non-GAAP financial measures of real estate companies’ operating performances.
Normalized FFO is defined as FFO adjusted for certain items which by their nature are not comparable from period to period or that tend to obscure the Company’s actual operating performance, including for the periods presented net goodwill impairment charges, pre-tax, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, pre-tax, start-up expenses, pre-tax, legal related expenses, pre-tax, other non-cash revenue & expense, pre-tax, close-out expenses, pre-tax, COVID-19 expenses, pre-tax and the tax effect of adjustments to funds from operations.
AFFO is defined as Normalized FFO adjusted by adding non-cash expenses such as non-real estate related depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation expense, the amortization of debt issuance costs, discount and/or premium and other non-cash interest, and by subtracting recurring consolidated maintenance capital expenditures.
Because of the unique design, structure and use of our secure facilities, processing centers and reentry centers we believe that assessing the performance of our secure facilities, processing centers and reentry centers without the impact of depreciation or amortization is useful and meaningful to investors. Although NAREIT has published its definition of FFO, companies often modify this definition as they seek to provide financial measures that meaningfully reflect their distinctive operations. We have modified FFO to derive Normalized FFO and AFFO that meaningfully reflect our operations.
Our assessment of our operations is focused on long-term sustainability. The adjustments we make to derive the non-GAAP measures of Normalized FFO and AFFO exclude items which may cause short-term fluctuations in net income attributable to GEO but have no impact on our cash flows, or we do not consider them to be fundamental attributes or the primary drivers of our business plan and they do not affect our overall long-term operating performance. We may make adjustments to FFO from time to time for certain other income and expenses that do not reflect a necessary component of our operational performance on the basis discussed above, even though such items may require cash settlement. Because FFO, Normalized FFO and AFFO exclude depreciation and amortization unique to real estate as well as non-operational items and certain other charges that are highly variable from year to year, they provide our investors with performance measures that reflect the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, per diem rates, operating costs and interest costs, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from income from net income attributable to GEO.
We believe the presentation of FFO, Normalized FFO and AFFO provide useful information to investors as they provide an indication of our ability to fund capital expenditures and expand our business. FFO, Normalized FFO and AFFO provide disclosure on the same basis as that used by our management and provide consistency in our financial reporting, facilitate internal and external comparisons of our historical operating performance and our business units and provide continuity to investors for comparability purposes. Additionally, FFO, Normalized FFO and AFFO are widely recognized measures in our industry as a real estate investment trust.
Our reconciliation of net income attributable to GEO to FFO, Normalized FFO and AFFO for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, is as follows (in thousands):
*
Tax adjustments relate to loss on real estate assets, goodwill impairment charges, (gain) loss on debt extinguishment, start-up expenses, COVID-19 expenses, close-out expenses and other non-cash revenue & expense.

Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, now known as COVID-19 (“COVID-19”), was reported in Wuhan, China and has since extensively impacted the global health and economic environment. In January 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. On February 28, 2020, the WHO raised its assessment of the COVID-19 threat from high to very high at a global level due to the continued increase in the number of cases and affected countries, and on March 11, 2020, the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic.
Health and Safety
As the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted communities across the United States and around the world, our employees and facilities have also been impacted by the spread of COVID-19. Ensuring the health and safety of our employees and all those in our care has always been our number one priority. As a longstanding provider of essential government services, we have experience with the implementation of best practices for the prevention, assessment, and management of infectious diseases.
•
All of our secure services facilities provide 24/7 access to healthcare;
•
Our ICE Processing Centers typically have approximately double the number of healthcare staff, compared to state correctional facilities;
•
Many of our facilities are equipped with Airborne Infection Isolation Rooms;
•
All of our facilities operate safely and without any overcrowded conditions; and
•
All of our facilities have access to regular handwashing with clean water and soap.
From the outset of the COVID-19 global pandemic, our corporate, regional and field staff have implemented and we continue to implement comprehensive steps to address and mitigate the risks of COVID-19 to all those in our care and our employees.
•
We issued guidance to all of our facilities, consistent with the guidance issued for correctional and detention facilities by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities and we will update this guidance as necessary;
•
We updated our policies and procedures to include best practices for the prevention, assessment, and management of COVID-19, including the implementation of quarantine and cohorting procedures to isolate confirmed and presumptive cases of COVID-19, including medical isolation and the use of Airborne Infection Isolation Rooms, and we will continue to update our policies and procedures as necessary;
•
We ordered and received and continue to order and receive swab test kits for COVID-19 from a national supplier, we enacted quarantine and testing procedures for any employees who may have come into contact with any individual who has tested positive for COVID-19 and we will update these quarantine and testing procedures as necessary;
•
In March 2020, we started procuring additional Personal Protective Equipment and began issuing it as clinically needed at facilities impacted by COVID-19. These efforts continued throughout 2020 and continue to date;
•
Over the course of April 2020, we coordinated with our government partners to distribute Personal Protective Equipment and to date we continue distributing Personal Protective Equipment, including face masks to all staff, inmates, detainees and residents as a precautionary measure at all of our Federal Bureau of Prisons facilities, ICE Processing Centers, U.S. Marshals facilities, state correctional facilities, local correctional facilities and jails, residential reentry centers, and youth services residential facilities;
•
We provided and continue to provide educational guidance to our employees and individuals in our care on the best preventative measures to avoid the spread of COVID-19 such as frequent and careful handwashing, avoiding touching areas of the face, including facial hair, avoiding individuals exhibiting flu-like symptoms, proper cough and sneeze etiquette, social distancing requirements and adjustments to laundry and meal schedules;
•
We increased the frequency of distribution of personal hygiene products, including soap, shampoo and body wash and tissue paper, and we are ensuring the daily availability of bars of soap or soap dispensers at each sink for hand washing in all of our facilities;
•
We advised and continue to advise our employees to remain home if they exhibit flu-like symptoms, and we have exercised and continue to exercise flexible paid leave and paid time off policies to allow for employees to remain home if they exhibit flu-like symptoms or to care for a family member;
•
We procured and continue to procure additional cleaning equipment and sanitation products that are proven healthcare grade disinfectants;
•
We deployed and continue to deploy specialized sanitation teams to sterilize high-contact areas at our facilities and have developed intensive schedules and procedures for the cleaning and disinfecting of facility spaces above and beyond normal cleaning activities;
•
As a service provider, GEO has fully disclosed and will continue to fully disclose all information related to COVID-19 testing, cases and fatalities to the appropriate federal, state and local government partners, as well as state and local health officials throughout the course of the pandemic;
•
At every one of our facilities, we have worked closely with our government agency partners and local health officials to develop COVID-19 emergency plans and testing policies for the individuals in our care and we will continue to work closely with our government agency partners and local health officials to update those plans and policies as necessary; and
•
We engaged with our government agency partners to promptly suspend non-essential visitation at all of our facilities, and we have employed additional measures during the intake and entry process at all of our facilities to include screening specific to COVID-19, including temperature checks for all staff and any legally required visitors before entering our facilities, as well as, verbal medical screening questionnaires and we will continue to engage our government agency partners on such measures.
We will continue to coordinate closely with our government agency partners and local health agencies to ensure the health and safety of all those in our care and our employees. We are grateful for our frontline employees who are making sacrifices daily to provide care for all those in our facilities during this unprecedented global pandemic. Information on the steps we have taken to address and mitigate the risks of COVID-19 can be found at www.geogroup.com/COVID19. The information on or accessible through our website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Economic Impact
The COVID-19 pandemic and related government-imposed mandatory closures, shelter in-place restrictions and social distancing protocols and increased expenditures on engineering controls, personal protective equipment, diagnostic testing, medical expenses, temperature scanners, protective plexiglass barriers and increased sanitation have had, and will continue to have, a severe impact on global economic conditions and the environment in which we operate. Starting in late March and early April, we began to observe negative impacts from the pandemic on our performance in our secure services business, specifically with our ICE Processing Centers and U.S. Marshals Facilities, as a result of declines in crossings and apprehensions along the Southwest border, a decrease in court sentencing at the federal level and reduced operational capacity to promote social distancing protocols which resulted in an estimated revenue decline of approximately 10 percent during 2020. Additionally, our reentry services business conducted through our GEO Care business segment has also been negatively impacted, specifically our residential reentry centers and non-residential day reporting programs were impacted by declines in programs due to lower levels of referrals by federal, state and local agencies, which resulted in an estimated revenue decline of approximately 12 percent during 2020.We expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have an impact on our populations for at least part of 2021, depending on various factors such as the progress of vaccine distributions. Additionally, we have experienced the transmission of COVID-19 at most of our facilities during 2020 and to date in the first quarter of 2021. If we are unable to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19 at our facilities, we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Although we are unable to predict the duration or scope of the COVID-19 pandemic or estimate the extent of the overall future negative financial impact to our operating results, an extended period of depressed economic activity necessitated to combating the disease, and the severity and duration of the related global economic crisis may adversely impact our future financial performance.
Revenue
Due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to determine the future landscape of growth opportunities in the near term; however any positive trends may, to some extent, be adversely impacted by government budgetary constraints in light of the pandemic or any changes to a government's willingness to maintain or grow public-private partnerships in the future. While state finances overall were stable prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, future budgetary pressures may cause state agencies to pursue a number of cost savings initiatives which may include reductions in per diem rates and/or the scope of services provided by private operators or the decision to not re-bid a contract after expiration of the contract term. These potential cost savings initiatives could have a material adverse impact on our current operations and/or our ability to pursue new business opportunities. Additionally, if state budgetary constraints, as discussed above, persist or intensify, our state customers’ ability to pay us may be impaired and/or we may be forced to renegotiate our management contracts on less favorable terms and our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely impacted. We plan to actively bid on any new projects that fit our target profile for profitability and operational risk. Any positive trends in the industry may be offset by several factors, including budgetary constraints, contract modifications, contract terminations, contract non-renewals, contract re-bids and/or the decision to not re-bid a contract after expiration of the contract term and the impact of any other potential changes to the willingness or ability to maintain or grow public-private partnerships on the part of other government agencies. We believe we have a strong relationship with our government agency partners and we believe that we operate facilities that maximize security, safety and efficiency while offering our suite of GEO Continuum of Care services and resources.
Although we have historically had a relatively high contract renewal rate, there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our expiring management contracts on favorable terms, or at all. Also, while we are pleased with our track record in re-bid situations, we cannot assure that we will prevail in any such future situations.
On January 26, 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order directing the United States Attorney General not to renew DOJ contracts with privately operated criminal detention facilities, as consistent with applicable law. Two agencies of the DOJ, the BOP and USMS, utilize our services. The BOP houses inmates who have been convicted of federal crimes, and the USMS is generally responsible for detainees who are awaiting trial or sentencing in U.S. federal courts. Our contracts with the BOP for our company-owned 1,940-bed Great Plains Correctional Facility, our company-owned 1,732-bed Big Spring Correctional Facility, our company-owned 1,800-bed Flightline Correctional Facility, and our company-owned 1,800-bed North Lake Correctional Facility have renewal option periods that expire on May 31, 2021, November 30, 2021, November 30, 2021, and September 30, 2022, respectively. Additionally, the contracts with the BOP for the county owned and managed 1,800-bed Reeves County Detention Center I & II and the 1,376-bed Reeves County Detention Center III have renewal option periods that expire September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. We have a management agreement with Reeves County, Texas for the management oversight of these two county-owned facilities. The Great Plains, Big Spring, Flightline, Northlake Correctional Facilities, Reeves County Detention Center I & II and Reeves County Detention Center III generate annualized revenues for GEO of approximately $35 million, $33 million, $35 million, $35 million, $4 million and $3 million, respectively. The BOP has experienced a decline in federal prison populations over the last several years, a trend that has more recently been accelerated by the COVID-19 global pandemic. As a result of the Executive Order and the decline in federal prison populations, we expect that our above described contracts with the BOP may not be renewed over the
coming years. Please see “Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Public-Private Partnerships.” Additionally, please refer to “Contract Expirations” below for a discussion of three other BOP contracts whose expiration we had already announced prior to the signing of the Executive Order. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our secure services contracts with the BOP accounted for approximately 12% of our total revenues.
Unlike the BOP, the USMS does not own and operate its detention facilities. The USMS contracts for the use of facilities, which are generally located in areas near federal courthouses, primarily through intergovernmental service agreements, and to a lesser extent, direct contracts. With respect to the USMS, the agency may determine to conduct a review of the possible application of the Executive Order on its facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our contracts and agreements with the USMS accounted for approximately 13% of our total revenues.
President Biden’s administration may implement further executive orders or directives relating to federal criminal justice policies and immigration policies which may impact the federal government’s use of public-private partnerships with respect to correctional and detention needs, including with respect to our contracts, and/or may impact the budget and spending priorities of federal agencies, including the BOP, USMS, and ICE.
California enacted legislation that became effective on January 1, 2020 aimed at phasing out public-private partnership contracts for the operation of secure facilities within California and facilities outside of the State of California housing State of California inmates. Additionally, we have public-private partnership contracts in place with ICE, the BOP and the USMS relating to facilities located in California. Our contract for our Central Valley facility was discontinued by the State of California at the end of September 2019, and our two other California secure facility contracts for our Desert View and Golden State Facilities expired during 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we signed two 15-year contracts with ICE for five company-owned facilities in California totaling 4,490 beds and a managed-only contract with the USMS for the government-owned, 512-bed El Centro Service Processing Center in California. Additionally, we and the DOJ have filed separate legal actions challenging the constitutionality of the attempted ban on new federal contracts entered into after the effective date of the California law. Currently, the State of Arizona, State of New Mexico and the State of Washington have proposed legislation similar to the California law. The Delaware County Council has also been exploring how to end the public-private arrangement for GEO’s managed-only contract for the 1,883-bed George W. Hill Correctional Facility located in Thornton, Pennsylvania and transition the operations to the government. The Pennsylvania facility generates approximately $46 million in annualized revenue for GEO.
Internationally, we are exploring opportunities in our current markets and will continue to actively bid on any opportunities that fit our target profile for profitability and operational risk. On March 29, 2018, we announced that our transportation joint venture in the United Kingdom, GEOAmey, signed a contract with Scottish Prison Service for the provision of court custody and escort services in Scotland. The contract has a base term of eight years effective January 26, 2019 with a renewal option of four years and is expected to have an average annual revenue of approximately $39 million. Also, we are pleased to have been awarded a ten-year contract renewal for the continued delivery of secure transportation under our GEOAmey joint venture in the United Kingdom. Total revenue over the ten-year period is expected to be approximately $760 million. In New South Wales, Australia, we have developed a 489-bed expansion at the Junee Correctional Centre which was substantially completed during the third quarter of 2020. We have also constructed a 137-bed expansion at the Fulham Correctional Centre in Victoria, Australia which was also substantially completed during the third quarter of 2020. With respect to the Parklea Correctional Centre in Australia, we were unfortunately unsuccessful during the competitive rebid process and transitioned the management contract in March of 2019. In addition, we transitioned the Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre to government operation in the State of Queensland, Australia at the end of June 2020.
With respect to our reentry services, electronic monitoring services, and community-based services business conducted through our GEO Care business segment, we are currently pursuing a number of business development opportunities. Related to opportunities for community-based reentry services, we are working with our existing federal, state, and local clients to leverage new opportunities for both residential reentry facilities as well as non-residential day reporting centers. However, in light of the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, we may not be successful. We continue to expend resources on informing federal, state and local governments about the benefits of public-private partnerships, and we anticipate that there will be new opportunities in the future as those efforts continue to yield results. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on any suitable opportunities that become available in this area.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses consist of those expenses incurred in the operation and management of our contracts to provide services to our governmental clients. Labor and related costs represented approximately 64% and 62% of our operating expenses in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Additional significant operating expenses include food, utilities and inmate medical costs. In 2020 and 2019, operating expenses totaled approximately 76% and 75% of our consolidated revenues, respectively. Our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2021 will be impacted by the opening of any new or existing facilities as a result of the cost of transitioning and/or start-up operations related to a facility opening. During 2021, we will incur carrying costs for facilities that were vacant in 2020. As of December 31, 2020, our worldwide operations include the management and/or ownership of approximately 93,000 beds at 118 secure, processing and community services facilities, including idle facilities, and also included the provision of monitoring of more than 210,000 individuals in a community-based environment on behalf of federal, state and local correctional agencies located in all 50 states.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate management salaries and benefits, professional fees and other administrative expenses. In both 2020 and 2019, general and administrative expenses totaled approximately 8% of our consolidated revenues. We expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2021 to remain consistent or decrease as a result of cost savings initiatives as well as less travel, marketing and other corporate administrative expenses primarily due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic
Idle Facilities
In our Secure Services segment, we are currently marketing approximately 990 vacant beds with a net book value of approximately $24 million at two of our idle facilities to potential customers. In our GEO Care segment, we are currently marketing approximately 1,100 vacant beds with a net book value of approximately $26.2 million at two of our idle facilities to potential customers. The combined annual carrying cost of these idle facilities in 2021 is estimated to be $6.3 million, including depreciation expense of $2.3 million. We currently do not have any firm commitments or agreements in place to activate these facilities but have ongoing contact with several potential customers. Historically, some facilities have been idle for multiple years before they received a new contract award. The per diem rates that we charge our clients often vary by contract across our portfolio. However, if the two idle facilities in our Secure Services and GEO Care segments were to be activated using our Secure Services average per diem rate in 2020, (calculated as the Secure Services revenue divided by the number of Secure Services mandays) and based on the average occupancy rate in our facilities for 2020, we would expect to receive annual incremental revenue of approximately $51 million and an increase in annual earnings per share of approximately $.02 to $.05 per share based on our average operating margin. Refer to discussion in Item I, Part I - Business under Executive Order and Contract Expirations above for discussion of recent developments.

if we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability, which would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders;
•
qualifying as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”);
•
complying with the REIT requirements may cause us to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive opportunities;
•
dividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends;
•
REIT distribution requirements could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan;
•
our cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate;
