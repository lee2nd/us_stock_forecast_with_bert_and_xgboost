Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The following management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, and with the other financial and statistical data presented in this annual report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from management's expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the section entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” and should be read herewith.
Management’s discussion focuses on 2020 results compared to 2019. For a discussion of 2019 results compared to 2018, refer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.
All amounts are in thousands, except share and per share data, or as otherwise noted.
Overview
Our focus is on building relationships by creating a win-win scenario for our clients and our Company. We believe in providing solutions and services to our clients that are based on fairness and simplicity. We have established a solid financial services franchise with a sizable presence for deposit gathering and building client relationships necessary for growth. We also believe that our established presence in our core markets of Colorado, the greater Kansas City region, Texas, Utah and New Mexico, which are outperforming national averages, positions us well for growth opportunities. As of December 31, 2020, we had $6.7 billion in assets, $4.4 billion in loans, $5.7 billion in deposits and $0.8 billion in equity.
Recent Events
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused substantial disruption to the communities we serve and has changed the way we live and work. We continue to remain committed to ensuring our associates, clients and communities are receiving the support they need during these challenging times. Our banking centers remain operational through our drive-thru services and on an appointment-only basis in the lobbies. We have continued to leverage our digital banking platform with our clients. Our teams have been working diligently to support our clients who are experiencing financial hardship due to COVID-19 through participation in the SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program, including assistance with PPP loan forgiveness applications, and loan modifications, as needed. While the initial release of the vaccine is promising, the length of time that the government-mandated measures must remain in place to address COVID-19 is unknown. The pandemic has already had a significantly negative impact to the U.S. labor market, consumer spending and business operations, and it is not clear how quickly the vaccine can be widely deployed and when government-mandated measures will be removed.
Operating Highlights and Key Challenges
Profitability and returns
●
Net income increased $8.2 million, or 10.2%, to $88.6 million, as of December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year. Net income during 2020 included $1.8 million, after tax, of expenses related to banking center consolidations. Adjusting for these expenses, net income would have been $90.4 million, or $2.91 per diluted share. Net income during 2019 included $0.7 million, after tax, of expenses related to banking center consolidations. Adjusting for these expenses, net income would have been $81.1 million, or $2.57 per diluted share.
●
A CECL model-driven provision for loan losses totaled $17.6 million, including a $0.1 million provision for unfunded loan commitment reserves, driven by deteriorating economic conditions caused by the impact of COVID-19. The year ended December 31, 2019 included a loan loss provision of $11.6 million.
●
The return on average tangible assets was 1.44% for 2020, compared to 1.42% for 2019. Adjusting for the banking center consolidation-related expense, the return on average tangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 1.47% and 1.43%, respectively.
●
The return on average tangible common equity was 13.27% for 2020, compared to 13.07% for 2019. Adjusting for the banking center consolidation-related expense, the return on average tangible common equity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 13.54% and 13.18%, respectively.
Strategic execution
●
Continue to pro-actively address the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic through executing on our priorities as detailed in the “Recent Events” section above.
●
Funded $358.9 million in SBA Paycheck Protection Program loans for 2,164 clients. In assisting our clients through the forgiveness process we had achieved forgiveness on 50% of our original PPP loan balances with the remaining balance totaling $176.1 million as of December 31, 2020.
●
As part of our continued focus on improving operating efficiencies and investing in digital solutions for our clients, we consolidated 11 banking centers during 2020 and one in January of 2021. Consolidation-related expense of $2.3 million was recorded to non-interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, in January 2021, we announced the consolidation of seven additional banking centers across our markets that are expected to be substantially completed in the first half of 2021. Once completed, this will bring our total banking center network down by 22%, compared to the third quarter of 2019 when we began these initiatives.
●
Maintain a conservatively structured loan portfolio represented by diverse industries and concentrations with most industry sector concentrations at 5% or less of total loans and all concentration levels remain well below our self-imposed limits.
●
We continue to carefully monitor our entire loan portfolio and have no industry exposure exceeding 5% of total loans for industries highly impacted by COVID-19, such as restaurants, retailers, hospital/medical, multifamily, oil and gas, hotels and lodging.
Loan portfolio
●
Loans outstanding totaled $4.4 billion, decreasing $61.7 million, or 1.4%, from the prior year, largely due to lower commercial and industrial loans of $140.9 million, or 10.0%, that were offset by PPP loans of $176.1 million.
●
We are taking a very careful approach to extending new credit as well as continuing an intense focus on managing credit risk and yield. Total loan originations during the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1.2 billion, led by commercial loan originations of $807.3 million, which included PPP loan originations of $358.9 million.
●
COVID-related loan modifications are handled individually on a relationship basis. As of December 31, 2020, $173.6 million, or 4.0%, of total loans were on a COVID-related modification plan.
Credit quality

●
Allowance for credit losses increased by 53.0% from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 due to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020 and to provide coverage for the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ACL totaled 1.37% of total loans compared to 0.88% at December 31, 2019. Excluding PPP loans, the ACL totaled 1.43% of total loans at December 31, 2020.
●
Net charge-offs of $2.7 million and $8.3 million were recorded during 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net charge-offs to average total loans totaled 0.06% and 0.19% for 2020 and 2019, respectively.
●
Credit quality remained strong, as non-performing loans (comprised of non-accrual loans and non-accrual troubled debt restructured loans) decreased to 0.47% of total loans at December 31, 2020, compared to 0.49% at December 31, 2019. Non-performing assets to total loans and OREO totaled 0.58% at December 31, 2020 compared to 0.66% at December 31, 2019.

Revenues
●
Fully taxable equivalent net interest income totaled $198.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and decreased $12.8 million, or 6.1%, compared to the prior year due to the decline in short-term interest rates as a result of monetary policy actions by the Federal Reserve.
●
The FTE net interest margin narrowed 51 basis points to 3.42% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the prior year due to lower earning asset yields. The yield on earning assets decreased 76 basis points, led by an 73 basis point decrease in the originated loan portfolio yields due to the decline in short-term interest rates. The cost of funds decreased 28 basis points to 0.46%.
●
Non-interest income totaled $140.3 million during 2020, increasing $57.5 million, or 69.5%, from 2019, primarily driven by record mortgage banking income totaling $102.4 million. During 2020, service charges and bank card fees decreased a combined $2.1 million due to changes in consumer behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Expenses
●
Non-interest expense totaled $206.2 million during 2020, representing an increase of $25.4 million, or 14.1%, from 2019. Salaries and benefits increased $18.4 million due to higher mortgage banking compensation-related expense. Banking center consolidation-related expense totaling $2.3 million was incurred during 2020, compared to $0.9 million during the same period in the last year.

●
At December 31, 2020, common book value per share was $26.79. The tangible common book value per share increased $2.20 to $23.09 at December 31, 2020, compared to December 31, 2019, as the earnings and positive fair market value adjustments in the available-for-sale securities portfolio outpaced the share repurchases, dividends and CECL cumulative effect adjustment.
●
The Bank maintains ample liquidity with excess cash liquidity of $365 million and access to $2.2 billion in readily available funds.
Key Challenges
There are a number of significant challenges confronting us and our industry. We face continual challenges implementing our business strategy, including growing the assets, particularly loans, and deposits of our business amidst intense competition, changing interest rates, adhering to changes in the regulatory environment and identifying and consummating disciplined acquisition and other expansionary opportunities in a very competitive environment. Prevailing interest rates began
decreasing in mid-2019, remain low and are expected to remain near zero for the foreseeable future as a result of monetary policy actions by the Federal Reserve.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption and is likely to continue to present challenges to our business. Temporary closures and sheltering in place policies have altered the way our clients and associates live and work. Our banking centers remain operational through our drive-thru services and on an appointment-only basis in the lobbies, and we have continued to leverage our digital banking platform with our clients. Our teams have been working diligently to support our clients who are experiencing financial hardship due to COVID-19 through participation in the SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program, including assistance with PPP loan forgiveness applications, and loan modifications, as needed. While conditions regarding the pandemic may be improving, there is continued uncertainty regarding economic recovery, the success of vaccine distribution and the effectiveness of administered vaccines.
Our markets have historically outperformed the national averages on many key indicators; however, the economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause economic strain nationally and across all of our markets. We are taking a very careful approach to extending new credit as well as continuing an intense focus on managing credit risk and yield. A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate and any deterioration in real estate values or credit quality or elevated levels of non-performing assets would ultimately have a negative impact on the quality of our loan portfolio.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had low exposure to industries highly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Within the commercial loan segment, restaurants were 4.8%, retailers 2.9%, hospital/medical 4.8% and oil and gas 0.7% of total loans. Within the commercial real estate non-owner occupied loan segment, hotel and lodging was 4.2%, multifamily 1.6% and retail 1.2% of total loans. The Company had no direct exposure to other industries and loan types more highly impacted by the pandemic including aviation, cruise lines, energy services, auto manufacturing/dealer floor plans, hedge funds, convention centers, credit cards, malls and taxi/ride share businesses. Furthermore, the Company had no consumer credit card, indirect auto or car leasing exposure.
The agriculture industry is in the sixth year of depressed commodity prices and is also being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our food and agribusiness portfolio is only 4.8% of total loans and is well-diversified across food production, crop and livestock types. Crop and livestock loans represent 0.8% of total loans. We have maintained relationships with food and agribusiness clients that generally possess low leverage and, correspondingly, low bank debt to assets, minimizing any potential credit losses in the future.
Our loans outstanding at December 31, 2020 totaled $4.4 billion, representing a decrease of $61.7 million, or 1.4%, compared to December 31, 2019, largely due to lower commercial and industrial loans of $140.9 million, or 10.0%. The decrease was partially offset by PPP loans, which totaled $176.1 million as of December 31, 2020. During 2020, our weighted average rate on new loans funded at the time of origination was 3.06%, compared to the weighted average yield of our originated loan portfolio of 4.05% (FTE). Future growth in our interest income will ultimately be dependent on our ability to continue to generate sufficient volumes of high-quality originated loans and other high-quality earning assets as well as Federal Reserve interest rate policy decisions.
Continued regulation, impending new liquidity and capital constraints, and a continual need to bolster cybersecurity are adding costs and uncertainty to all U.S. banks and could affect profitability. Also, nontraditional participants in the market may offer increased competition as non-bank payment businesses, including FinTechs, are expanding into traditional banking products. While certain external factors are out of our control and may provide obstacles to our business strategy, we are prepared to deal with these challenges. We seek to remain flexible, yet methodical and proactive, in our strategic decision making so that we can quickly respond to market changes and the inherent challenges and opportunities that accompany such changes.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies
We use accounting principles and methods that conform to GAAP and general banking practices. We are required to apply significant judgment and make material estimates in the preparation of our financial statements and with regard to various accounting, reporting and disclosure matters. Assumptions and estimates are required to apply these principles where actual measurement is not possible or practical. The most significant of these estimates relate to the determination of the allowance
for credit losses. See additional discussion of our ACL policy in note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The determination of the ACL, which represents management’s estimate of lifetime credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio at the balance sheet date, involves a high degree of judgment and complexity. The Company estimates the collective ACL by first disaggregating the loan portfolio into segments based upon broad characteristics such as primary use and underlying collateral. Within these segments, the portfolio is further disaggregated into classes of loans with similar attributes and risk characteristics. The collective ACL is determined at the class level, analyzing loss history based upon specific loss drivers and risk factors affecting each loan class. The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model that incorporates forecasts of certain national macroeconomic factors (reasonable and supportable forecasts) which drive the losses predicted in establishing the Company’s collective ACL. Management accounts for the inherent uncertainty of the underlying economic forecast by reviewing and weighting alternate forecast scenarios. For periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to historical long-term average loss rates on a straight-line basis. Additionally, the collective ACL calculation includes subjective adjustments for qualitative risk factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses to differ from historical experience. Changes in these assumptions, estimates or the conditions surrounding them may have a material impact on our financial condition. For further discussion of the ACL, see notes 2 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements.
Future Accounting Pronouncements
The Company is still evaluating the impact from ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting and does not expect the adoption of that pronouncement to have a material impact on its financial statements.
Financial Condition
Total assets were $6.7 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $5.9 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $764.4 million, or 13.0%. Cash and cash equivalents increased $495.4 million, and total loans decreased $61.7 million, or 1.4%. The allowance for credit losses increased $20.7 million, or 53.0%, to $59.8 million at December 31, 2020. It included a CECL adoption Day 1 increase of $5.8 million, partially offsetting the increase in total assets.
During 2020, lower cost demand, savings and money market deposits (“transaction deposits”) increased $1.0 billion, or 27.5%, compared to the prior year, as we benefited from cash inflows resulting from the CARES Act economic stimulus and continued developing full banking relationships with our clients. Our clients used their core operating accounts for PPP funds and economic stimulus checks, which aided the strong deposit growth. In addition to providing excess cash liquidity, the increase in transaction deposits provided low-cost funding utilized to fund PPP loans and pay off short-term borrowings.
Investment securities
Available-for-sale
Total investment securities available-for-sale were $662.0 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $638.2 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $23.7 million, or 3.71%. During 2020 and 2019, purchases of available-for-sale securities totaled $286.1 million and $45.7 million, respectively. Maturities and paydowns of available-for-sale securities during 2020 and 2019 totaled $271.5 million and $195.5 million, respectively. There were no sales of available-for-sale securities during 2020. Proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities during 2019 totaled $20.4 million.
Available-for-sale investment securities are summarized as follows as of the dates indicated:
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, nearly all the available-for-sale investment portfolio was backed by mortgages. The residential mortgage pass-through securities portfolio is comprised of both fixed rate and adjustable rate Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”), Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”) and Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”) securities. The other mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) are comprised of securities backed by FHLMC, FNMA and GNMA securities.
Mortgage-backed securities may have actual maturities that differ from contractual maturities depending on the repayment characteristics and experience of the underlying financial instruments. The estimated weighted average life of the available-for-sale mortgage-backed securities portfolio was 2.7 years and 2.9 years at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. This estimate is based on assumptions and actual results may differ. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the duration of the total available-for-sale investment portfolio was 2.6 years and 2.7 years, respectively.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, adjustable rate securities comprised 2.3% and 2.8%, respectively, of the available-for-sale mortgage-backed security portfolio. The remainder of the portfolio was comprised of fixed rate amortizing securities with 10 to 30 year contractual maturities, with a weighted average coupon of 2.00% per annum and 2.40% per annum at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The available-for-sale investment portfolio included $11.7 million and $5.3 million of unrealized gains and $0.4 million and $5.1 million of unrealized losses at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. We believe any unrealized losses are a result of prevailing interest rates, and as such, we do not believe that any of the securities with unrealized losses were impaired. Management believes that default of the available-for-sale securities is highly unlikely. FHLMC, FNMA and GNMA guaranteed mortgage-backed securities have a long history of zero credit losses, an explicit guarantee by the U.S. government (although limited for FNMA and FHLMC securities) and yields that generally trade based on market views of prepayment and liquidity risk rather than credit risk.
Held-to-maturity
At December 31, 2020, we held $376.6 million of held-to-maturity investment securities, compared to $182.9 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $193.7 million, or 105.9%. Purchases of held-to-maturity securities totaled $284.2 million and $10.2 million during 2020 and 2019, respectively. Maturities and paydowns of held-to-maturity securities totaled $88.1 million and $60.9 million during 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Held-to-maturity investment securities are summarized as follows as of the dates indicated:
The residential mortgage pass-through and other residential MBS held-to-maturity investment portfolios are comprised of fixed rate FHLMC, FNMA and GNMA securities.
The fair value of the held-to-maturity investment portfolio included $5.3 million and $1.3 million of unrealized gains and $0.3 million and $0.5 million of unrealized losses at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
The Company does not measure expected credit losses on a financial asset, or group of financial assets, in which historical credit loss information adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts results in an expectation that nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is zero. Management evaluated held-to-maturity securities noting they are backed by loans guaranteed by either U.S. government agencies or U.S. government sponsored entities, and management believes that default is highly unlikely given this governmental backing and long history without credit losses. Additionally, management notes that yields on which the portfolio generally trades are based upon market views of prepayment and liquidity risk and not credit risk. The Company has no intention to sell the securities and believes it will not be required to sell the securities before the recovery of their amortized cost
Mortgage-backed securities may have actual maturities that differ from contractual maturities depending on the repayment characteristics and experience of the underlying financial instruments. The estimated weighted average expected life of the held-to-maturity mortgage-backed securities portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was 2.4 years and 2.4 years, respectively. This estimate is based on assumptions and actual results may differ. The duration of the total held-to-maturity portfolio was 2.4 years and 2.3 years as of December 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
Loans overview
At December 31, 2020, our loan portfolio was comprised of new loans that we have originated and loans that were acquired in connection with our six acquisitions to date.
The table below shows the loan portfolio composition at the respective dates:
(1)
PPP loan balances are net of fees and costs and include principal totaling $179,531 as of December 31, 2020.
Our loan portfolio decreased $61.7 million, or 1.4%, since December 31, 2019. We are taking a careful approach to extending credit and focusing on managing credit risk and yield. Year-to-date loan originations through December 31, 2020 totaled $1.2 billion, including $358.9 million of PPP loan originations, which were offset by elevated levels of paydowns and payoffs.
Our commercial and industrial loan portfolio is comprised of diverse industry segments. At December 31, 2020, these segments included finance and financial services, primarily lender finance loans of $257.9 million, hospital/medical loans of $207.8 million, manufacturing-related loans of $111.2 million, and a variety of smaller subcategories of commercial and industrial loans. Food and agribusiness loans, which are well-diversified across food production, crop and livestock types, totaled $210.3 million and were 28.0% of the Company’s risk based capital. Crop and livestock loans represent 0.8% of total loans.
Non-owner occupied CRE loans were 84.3% of the Company’s risk based capital, or 14.5% of total loans, and no specific property type comprised more than 5.0% of total loans. The Company maintains very little exposure to retail properties, comprising 4.1% of total loans. Multi-family loans totaled $71.4 million, or 1.6% of total loans as of December 31, 2020.
The Company maintains a granular and well-diversified loan portfolio with self-imposed concentration limits. In light of the strain placed on certain industries by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has carefully evaluated and continues to closely monitor our entire loan portfolio. Within the commercial loan segment, certain highly impacted industries are noted as follows: restaurants were 4.8%, retailers 2.9%, hospital/medical 4.8% and oil and gas 0.7% of total loans. Within the commercial real estate non-owner occupied loan segment, hotel and lodging was 4.2%, multifamily 1.6% and retail 1.2% of total loans. The Company had no direct exposure to other industries more highly impacted by the pandemic including aviation, cruise lines, energy services, auto manufacturing/dealer floor plans, hedge funds, convention centers, credit cards, malls and taxi/ride share businesses. Furthermore, the Company had no consumer credit card, indirect auto or car leasing exposure.
When considering the loan portfolio in its entirety, 77.0% of loans were located within our footprint of Colorado, the greater Kansas City region, Texas, Utah and New Mexico as of December 31, 2020, based on the domicile of the borrower or, in the case of collateral-dependent loans, the geographical location of the collateral.
New loan origination is a direct result of our ability to recruit and retain top banking talent, connect with clients in our markets and provide needed services at competitive rates. Loan originations totaled $1.2 billion over the past 12 months, led by commercial loan originations of $807.3 million, which included PPP loan originations of $358.9 million. Originations are defined as closed end funded loans and revolving lines of credit advances, net of any current period paydowns. Management utilizes this more conservative definition of originations to better approximate the impact of originations on loans outstanding and ultimately net interest income.
The following tables represent new loan originations during 2020 and 2019:
Included in originations are net fundings (paydowns) under revolving lines of credit of $50,982, ($27,899), ($55,826) and $48,789 as of the fourth quarter 2020, third quarter 2020, second quarter 2020 and first quarter 2020, respectively.
Included in originations are net fundings under revolving lines of credit of $1,756, $37,062, $48,955 and $105,235 as of the fourth quarter 2019, third quarter 2019, second quarter 2019 and first quarter 2019, respectively.
The tables below show the contractual maturities of our loans for the dates indicated:
The stated interest rate (which excludes the effects of non-refundable loan origination and commitment fees, net of costs and the accretion of fair value marks) of total loans with maturities over one year is as follows at the dates indicated:
(1)
Included in municipal and non-profit fixed rate loans are loans totaling $387,105 and $403,700 that have been swapped to variable rates at current market pricing at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Included in the municipal and non-profit segment are tax exempt loans totaling $711,582 and $701,825 with a weighted average rate of 3.33% and 3.41% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Asset quality
Asset quality is fundamental to our success and remains a strong point, driven by our disciplined adherence to our self-imposed concentration limits across industry sector and real estate property type. Accordingly, for the origination of loans, we have established a credit policy that allows for responsive, yet controlled lending with credit approval requirements that are scaled to loan size. Within the scope of the credit policy, each prospective loan is reviewed in order to determine the appropriateness and the adequacy of the loan characteristics and the security or collateral prior to making a loan. We have established underwriting standards and loan origination procedures that require appropriate documentation, including financial data and credit reports. For loans secured by real property, we require property appraisals, title insurance or a title opinion, hazard insurance and flood insurance, in each case where appropriate.
Additionally, we have implemented procedures to timely identify loans that may become problematic in order to ensure the most beneficial resolution for the Company. Asset quality is monitored by our credit risk management department and evaluated based on quantitative and subjective factors such as the timeliness of contractual payments received. Additional factors that are considered, particularly with commercial loans over $500,000, include the financial condition and liquidity of individual borrowers and guarantors, if any, and the value of our collateral. To facilitate the oversight of asset quality, loans are categorized based on the number of days past due and on an internal risk rating system, and both are discussed in more detail below.
Our internal risk rating system uses a series of grades which reflect our assessment of the credit quality of loans based on an analysis of the borrower's financial condition, liquidity and ability to meet contractual debt service requirements. Loans that are perceived to have acceptable risk are categorized as “Pass” loans. “Special mention” loans represent loans that have potential credit weaknesses that deserve close attention. Special mention loans include borrowers that have potential weaknesses or unwarranted risks that, unless corrected, may threaten the borrower's ability to meet debt service requirements. However, these borrowers are still believed to have the ability to respond to and resolve the financial issues that threaten their financial situation. Loans classified as “Substandard” have a well-defined credit weakness and are inadequately protected by the current paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Although these loans are identified as potential problem loans, they may never become non-performing. Substandard loans have a distinct possibility of loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. “Doubtful” loans are loans that management believes that collection of payments in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement are highly questionable and improbable. Doubtful loans are deemed impaired and put on non-accrual status.
In the event of borrower default, we may seek recovery in compliance with state lending laws, the respective loan agreements, and credit monitoring and remediation procedures that may include modifying or restructuring a loan from its original terms, for economic or legal reasons, to provide a concession to the borrower from their original terms due to borrower financial difficulties in order to facilitate repayment. Such restructured loans are considered TDRs in accordance with ASC 310-40. Assets that have been foreclosed on or acquired through deed-in-lieu of foreclosure are classified as OREO until sold, and are carried at the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell, with any initial valuation adjustments charged to the ALL and any subsequent declines in carrying value charged to impairments on OREO.
Non-performing assets and past due loans
Non-performing assets consist of non-accrual loans, TDRs on non-accrual and OREO. Interest income that would have been recorded had non-accrual loans performed in accordance with their original contract terms during 2020 and 2019 was $1.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively.
Past due status is monitored as an indicator of credit deterioration. Loans are considered past due or delinquent when the contractual principal or interest due in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement remains unpaid after the due date of the scheduled payment. Loans that are 90 days or more past due are put on non-accrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection.
The following table sets forth the non-performing assets and past due loans as of the dates presented:
During 2020, total non-performing loans decreased $1.4 million, or 6.3%, from December 31, 2019. During 2020, accruing TDRs increased $7.1 million.
Loans 30-89 days past due and still accruing interest decreased $5.4 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $1.5 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, for a collective decrease in total past due loans of $6.9 million. Loans 30 days or more past due were 0.03% of total loans at December 31, 2020, the lowest level in our Company’s history.
The Company continues to monitor the operating status and trends of our clients to enable us to quickly detect credit deterioration and take action where needed. The CARES Act afforded financial institutions the option to modify loans within certain parameters in response to the COVID-19 pandemic without requiring the modifications to be classified as TDRs under ASC Topic 310 if the borrower has been adversely impacted by COVID-19 and was current on their loan payments as of December 31, 2019. During 2020, the Company has executed COVID-related loan modifications totaling $519.0 million. Loans with COVID-related modifications during 2020 totaled 11.9% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. Of those loans, $345.4 million have resumed making principal or interest payments or paid in full as of December 31, 2020. Modified loans that remained on a payment deferral plan at December 31, 2020 totaled $173.6 million, or 4.0% of the total loan portfolio, of which 26.2% were a subsequent modification. Monthly interest payments were required on 96.2% of the COVID modified loans as of December 31, 2020. All COVID modified loans were classified as performing as of December 31, 2020.
The following table sets forth COVID-19 loan modifications currently on a deferral plan as of the date presented:
Allowance for credit losses
The ACL represents the amount that we believe is necessary to absorb estimated lifetime credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and involves a high degree of judgment and complexity. On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments which replaced the incurred loss methodology for recognizing credit losses with a CECL model. The Company utilizes a DCF model developed within a third-party software tool to establish expected lifetime credit losses for the loan portfolio. The ACL is calculated as the difference between the amortized cost basis and the projections from the DCF analysis. The DCF model allows for individual life of loan cash flow modeling, excluding extensions and renewals, using loan-specific interest rates and repayment schedules including estimated prepayment rates and loss recovery timing delays. The model incorporates forecasts of certain national macroeconomic factors, including unemployment rates, home price index (“HPI”), retail sales and gross domestic product (“GDP”), which drive correlated loss rates. The determination and application of the ACL accounting policy involves judgments, estimates and uncertainties that are subject to change. For periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, we revert to historical long-term average loss rates on a straight-line basis.
We measure expected credit losses for loans on a pooled basis when similar risk characteristics exist. We have identified four primary loan segments within the ACL model that are further stratified into 11 loan classes to provide more granularity in analyzing loss history and to allow for more definitive qualitative adjustments based upon specific risk factors affecting each loan class. Generally, the underlying risk of loss for each of these loan segments will follow certain norms/trends in various economic environments. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis and are not included in the collective evaluation. Following are the loan classes within each of the four primary loan segments:
Loans on non-accrual, in bankruptcy and TDRs with a balance greater than $250,000 are excluded from the pooled analysis and are evaluated individually. If management determines that foreclosure is probable, expected credit losses are evaluated based on the criteria listed below, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. Typically, these loans consist of commercial, commercial real estate and agriculture loans and exclude homogeneous loans such as residential real estate and consumer loans. Specific allowances are determined by collectively analyzing:
●
the borrower’s resources, ability and willingness to repay in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement;
●
the likelihood of receiving financial support from any guarantors;
●
the adequacy and present value of future cash flows, less disposal costs, of any collateral; and
●
the impact current economic conditions may have on the borrower’s financial condition and liquidity or the value of the collateral.
The collective resulting ACL for loans is calculated as the sum of the general reserves, specific reserves on individually evaluated loans, and qualitative factor adjustments. While these amounts are calculated by individual loan or on a pool basis by segment and class, the entire ACL is available for any loan that, in our judgment, should be charged-off. The determination and application of the ACL accounting policy involves judgments, estimates, and uncertainties that are subject to change. Changes in these assumptions, estimates or the conditions surrounding them may have a material impact on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
Provision for loan losses for funded loans of $17.5 million, and provision for unfunded loan commitments of $0.1 million was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020 to provide coverage for the impact of deteriorating economic conditions as a result of COVID-19 and to support net charge-offs. Net charge-offs on loans during the year ended December 31, 2020 were $2.7 million, or 0.06% of total loans. Specific reserves on loans totaled $1.9 million at December 31, 2020.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, provision for loan losses of $11.6 million was recorded to support originated loan growth and cover net charge-offs. Net charge-offs were $8.3 million, or 0.19% of total loans, and specific reserves on individually evaluated loans totaled $1.8 million at December 31, 2019.
The Company has elected to exclude accrued interest receivable (“AIR”) from the ACL calculation. When a loan is placed on non-accrual, any recorded AIR is reversed against interest income. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, AIR from loans totaled $16.7 million and $17.2 million, respectively.
Total ACL
After considering the above mentioned factors, we believe that the ACL of $59.8 million is adequate to cover estimated lifetime losses inherent in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. However, it is likely that future adjustments to the ACL will be necessary. Any changes to the underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates, including but not limited to impacts of COVID-19 on the macro-economic forecast, used in determining the ACL, could adversely affect the Company's results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.
The following schedule presents, by class stratification, the changes in the ACL during the years listed:
(1)
Related to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. Refer to note 1 - Basis of Presentation and note 7 - Allowance for Credit Losses of our consolidated financial statements for further details.
The following tables present the allocation of the ACL and the percentage of the total amount of loans in each loan category listed as of the dates presented:
(1)
PPP loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA.
Deposits
Deposits from banking clients serve as a primary funding source for our banking operations and our ability to gather and manage deposit levels is critical to our success. Deposits not only provide a low-cost funding source for our loans, but also provide a foundation for the client relationships that are critical to future loan growth. The following table presents information regarding our deposit composition at December 31, 2020 and 2019:
The following table shows scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit with denominations greater than or equal to $250,000 as of December 31, 2020:
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, time deposits that were scheduled to mature within 12 months totaled $659.5 million and $726.9 million, respectively. Of the time deposits scheduled to mature within 12 months at December 31, 2020, $103.5 million were in denominations of $250,000 or more, and $556.0 million were in denominations less than $250,000. The aggregate amount of certificates of deposit in denominations that meet or exceed the FDIC insurance limit was $165.9 million and $163.7 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements provides a maturity schedule of time deposits outstanding at December 31, 2020.
Other borrowings
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Bank sold securities under agreements to repurchase totaling $22.9 million and $56.9 million, respectively. In addition, as a member of the FHLB, the Bank has access to a line of credit and term financing from the FHLB with total available credit of $0.9 billion at December 31, 2020. The Bank utilizes its FHLB line of credit as a funding mechanism for originated loans and loans held for sale. At December 31, 2020, the Bank had no outstanding borrowings with the FHLB. At December 31, 2019, the Bank had $192.7 million in line of credit advances from the FHLB that matured within a day and one term advance totaling $15.0 million with a fixed interest rate of 2.33% and a maturity date in October 2020. The Bank may pledge investment securities and loans as collateral for FHLB advances. There were no investment securities pledged at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2019, investment securities pledged totaled $17.6 million. Loans pledged were $1.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2019. Interest expense related to FHLB advances totaled $1.3 million and $6.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Regulatory Capital
Our subsidiary bank and the holding company are subject to the regulatory capital adequacy requirements of the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC, as applicable. Failure to meet the minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly further discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material adverse effect on us. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our subsidiary bank and the consolidated holding company exceeded all capital ratio requirements under prompt corrective action and other regulatory requirements, as further detailed in note 14 of our consolidated financial statements.
Results of Operations
Our net income depends largely on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities. Our results of operations are also affected by provisions for loan losses and non-interest income, such as service charges, bank card income, swap fee income, and gain on sale of mortgages, net. Our primary operating expenses, aside from interest expense, consist of salaries and benefits, occupancy costs, telecommunications data processing expense, and intangible asset amortization. Any expenses related to the resolution of problem assets are also included in non-interest expense.
Overview of results of operations
We recorded net income of $88.6 million, or $2.85 per diluted share, during 2020, compared to net income of $80.4 million, or $2.55 per diluted share, during 2019. Adjusting for the banking center consolidation-related expense, net income was $90.4 million, or $2.91 per diluted share, during 2020, and $81.1 million, or $2.57 per diluted share, during 2019.
Net interest income
We regularly review net interest income metrics to provide us with indicators of how the various components of net interest income are performing. We regularly review: (i) our loan mix and the yield on loans; (ii) the investment portfolio and the related yields; (iii) our deposit mix and the cost of deposits; and (iv) net interest income simulations for various forecast periods.
The table below presents the components of net interest income on a FTE basis for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The effects of trade-date accounting of investment securities for which the cash had not settled are not considered interest earning assets and are excluded from this presentation for time frames prior to their cash settlement, as are the market value adjustments on the investment securities available-for-sale and loans.
(1)
Originated loans are net of deferred loan fees, less costs, which are included in interest income over the life of the loan.
(2)
Presented on an FTE basis using the statutory tax rate of 21% for all periods presented. The taxable equivalent adjustments included above are $5,103, $5,065 and $4,482 for the years ended 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
(3)
Loan fees included in interest income totaled $15,713, $6,328 and $6,027 during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Net interest income totaled $192.9 million, $205.8 million and $197.4 million during the years ended 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The yield on earning assets decreased 76 basis points, led by a decrease in the originated portfolio yields due to monetary policy actions by the Federal Reserve. During 2020, the cost of funds decreased 28 basis points, compared to the prior year.
Average loans comprised $4.5 billion, or 78.3%, of total average interest earning assets during 2020, compared to $4.3 billion, or 79.8%, during 2019. The increase in average loan balances was primarily driven by an increase in average PPP loans. During 2020, we took a very careful approach to extending new credit as well as continuing an intense focus on managing credit risk and yield. This led to loan originations of $1.2 billion, during 2020, which were more than offset by higher levels of paydowns and payoffs. We continue to maintain a granular and well diversified loan portfolio with self-imposed concentration limits. In light of the strain placed on industries by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have carefully evaluated and continue to closely monitor our entire loan portfolio. Higher deposits, loan paydowns and loan payoffs, combined with lower loan originations, drove a higher average cash and cash equivalent balance of $281.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to an average balance of $100.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Average investment securities comprised 14.5% and 17.2% of total interest earning assets during 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the year-ended December 31, 2020, investment security purchases totaled $570.3 million and were partially offset by maturities of $359.6 million.
Average balances of interest bearing liabilities increased $61.8 million during 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was driven by interest bearing demand, savings and money market deposits of $303.9 million, partially offset by decreases in FHLB advances, time deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $173.8 million, $36.4 million and $31.9 million, respectively.
Total interest expense related to interest bearing liabilities was $25.1 million and $36.8 million during 2020 and 2019, respectively, at an average cost of 0.64% and 0.96% during 2020 and 2019, respectively. Additionally, the cost of deposits decreased 19 basis points to 0.45% during 2020, compared to 0.64% during 2019, due to the decline in short-term interest rates as a result of monetary policy actions by the Federal Reserve.
The following table summarizes the changes in net interest income on an FTE basis by major category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, identifying changes related to volume and changes related to rates for 2020, 2019 and 2018:
(1)
Originated loans are net of deferred loan fees, less costs, which are included in interest income over the life of the loan.
(2)
Presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis using the statutory tax rate of 21% for all periods presented. The taxable equivalent adjustments included above are $5,103, $5,065 and $4,482 for the years ended 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
(3)
Loan fees included in interest income totaled $15,713, $6,328 and $6,027 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Below is a breakdown of average deposits and the average rates paid during the periods indicated:
Provision for loan losses
The provision for loan losses represents the amount of expense that is necessary to bring the ACL to a level that we deem appropriate to absorb estimated lifetime losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The determination of the ACL, and the resultant provision for loan losses, is subjective and involves significant estimates and assumptions.
Provision for loan losses of $17.6 million was recorded under the CECL model during 2020, including a $0.1 million provision for unfunded loan commitment reserves, to provide coverage for the impact of deteriorating economic conditions as a result of COVID-19 and to cover net charge-offs. Provision of $11.6 million was recorded under the prior incurred loss model during 2019 to support originated loan growth and net charge-offs. The allowance for credit losses totaled 1.37% of total loans at December 31, 2020, compared to 0.88% at December 31, 2019, and included a CECL adoption Day 1 increase of $5.8 million. Excluding PPP loans, the allowance for credit losses totaled 1.43% of loans at December 31, 2020.
Non-interest income
The table below details the components of non-interest income for the years presented:
Non-interest income totaled $140.3 million and $82.8 million during 2020 and 2019, respectively. During 2020, mortgage banking income reached a record $102.4 million, increasing $60.0 million, or 141.8%, compared to the prior year. The mortgage banking income increase was driven by higher loan production due to lower prevailing interest rates. During 2020, bank card fees increased $0.9 million, or 5.8%, and service charges decreased $2.9 million, or 16.4%, due to changes in consumer behavior as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Non-interest expense
The table below details the components of non-interest expense for the years presented:
During 2020, non-interest expense increased $25.4 million, or 14.1%, compared to 2019, largely due to higher mortgage banking performance-related compensation. Banking center consolidation-related expense totaled $2.3 million, compared to $0.9 million during the prior year. The consolidations of 12 banking centers were announced in the second quarter of 2020 and were substantially complete at December 31, 2020. Additionally, included in the prior period were net gains on the sale of OREO of $7.2 million, compared to minimal net gains on the sale of OREO recorded in 2020.
Income taxes
Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Under this guidance, deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws. ASC Topic 740 requires the establishment of a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset unless it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefit of the deferred tax asset will be realized. For purposes of projecting whether the deferred tax asset will be realized, we consider tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, estimates of future taxable income, and available tax planning strategies. If tax regulations, operating results, or the ability to implement tax planning strategies varies, adjustments to the carrying value of the deferred tax assets may be required. We believe that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets.
Income tax expense totaled $20.8 million during 2020 compared to $15.8 million during 2019. Included in income tax expense was $2.2 million of tax benefits from stock compensation activity during 2019. Adjusting for the stock compensation activity, the effective tax rate for 2020 was 19.0% compared to an adjusted rate of 18.7% for 2019. As of December 31, 2020, our marginal tax rate (the rate we pay on each incremental dollar of earnings) was approximately 23%. However, our effective tax rate (income tax expense divided by income before income taxes) for a given period differs from our marginal rate largely due to income and expense items that are non-taxable or non-deductible in the calculation of income tax expense. The lower effective tax rates compared to the federal statutory tax rate was primarily due to interest income from tax-exempt lending, bank-owned life insurance income, and the relationship of these items to pre-tax income.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is monitored and managed to ensure that sufficient funds are available to operate our business and pay our obligations to depositors and other creditors, while providing ample available funds for opportunistic and strategic investments. On-balance sheet liquidity is represented by our cash and cash equivalents and unencumbered investment securities, and is detailed in the table below as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Total on-balance sheet liquidity increased $684.4 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, primarily driven by strong deposit growth.
Through our relationship with the FHLB, we have pledged qualifying loans and investment securities allowing us to obtain additional liquidity through FHLB advances and lines of credit. The Bank may pledge investment securities and loans as collateral for FHLB advances. There were no investment securities pledged at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2019, investment securities totaling $17.6 million were pledged as collateral for FHLB advances. The Bank had loans pledged as collateral for FHLB advances of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2019. FHLB advances, lines of credit and other short-term borrowing availability totaled $0.9 billion at December 31, 2020. The Bank can obtain additional liquidity through the FHLB facility, if required, and also has access to the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (“PPPLF”) and federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks.
Our primary sources of funds are deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, prepayments and maturities of loans and investment securities, the sale of investment securities, and funds provided from operations. We anticipate having access to other third party funding sources, including the ability to raise funds through the issuance of shares of our common stock or other equity or equity-related securities, incurrence of debt, and federal funds purchased, that may also be a source of liquidity. We anticipate that these sources of liquidity will provide adequate funding and liquidity for at least a 12-month period.
Our primary uses of funds are loan originations, investment security purchases, withdrawals of deposits, settlement of repurchase agreements, capital expenditures, operating expenses, and share repurchases. For additional information regarding our operating, investing and financing cash flows, see our consolidated statements of cash flows in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Exclusive from the investing activities related to acquisitions, our primary investing activities are originations and pay-offs and pay downs of loans and purchases and sales of investment securities. At December 31, 2020, pledgeable investment securities represented a significant source of liquidity. Our available-for-sale investment securities are carried at fair value and our held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Our collective investment securities portfolio totaled $1.0 billion at December 31, 2020, inclusive of pre-tax net unrealized gains of $11.4 million on the available-for-sale securities portfolio. Additionally, our held-to-maturity securities portfolio had $5.1 million of pre-tax net unrealized gains at December 31, 2020. The gross unrealized gains and losses are detailed in note 4 of our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2020, our investment securities portfolio consisted primarily of MBS, all of which were issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies or sponsored enterprises. The anticipated repayments and marketability of these securities offer substantial resources and flexibility to meet new loan demand, reinvest in the investment securities portfolio, or provide optionality for reductions in our deposit funding base.
At present, financing activities primarily consist of changes in deposits and repurchase agreements, and advances from the FHLB, in addition to the payment of dividends and the repurchase of our common stock. Maturing time deposits represent a potential use of funds. As of December 31, 2020, $659.5 million of time deposits were scheduled to mature within 12 months. Based on the current interest rate environment, market conditions, and our consumer banking strategy focusing on both lower cost transaction accounts and term deposits, our strategy is to replace a portion of those maturing time deposits with transaction deposits and market-rate time deposits.
Under the Basel III requirements, at December 31, 2020, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements, and the Bank had regulatory capital ratios in excess of the levels established for well-capitalized institutions. For more information on regulatory capital, see note 14 in our consolidated financial statements.
Our shareholders' equity is impacted by earnings, changes in unrealized gains and losses on securities, net of tax, stock-based compensation activity, share repurchases and the payment of dividends.
The Board of Directors has authorized multiple programs to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock from time to time either in open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable regulations of the SEC. On February 26, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $50.0 million from time to time in either the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. This authorization was in addition to the $12.6 million remaining for share repurchase that was previously approved by the Board on August 5, 2016. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company repurchased 734,117 shares for $19.5 million. This completed the previous authorization approved in August 2016. The remaining authorization under the program approved in February 2020 was $43.1 million at December 31, 2020.
On January 21, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per common share, payable on March 15, 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 26, 2021.
Asset/Liability Management and Interest Rate Risk
Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for managing interest rate risk and employing risk management policies that monitor and limit this exposure. Interest rate risk is measured using net interest income simulations and market value of portfolio equity analyses. These analyses use various assumptions, including the nature and timing of interest rate changes, yield curve shape, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, and reinvestment/replacement of asset and liability cash flows.
The principal objective of the Company's asset and liability management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk within the balance sheet and pursue a controlled assumption of interest rate risk while maximizing earnings and preserving adequate levels of liquidity and capital. The asset and liability management function is under the guidance of the Asset Liability
Committee with direction from the Board of Directors. The Asset Liability Committee meets monthly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of the Company's assets and liabilities to interest rate changes, local and national market conditions and rates. The Asset Liability Committee also reviews the liquidity, capital, deposit mix, loan mix and investment positions of the Company.
Instantaneous parallel rate shift scenarios are modeled and utilized to evaluate risk and establish exposure limits for acceptable changes in net interest margin. These scenarios, known as rate shocks, simulate an instantaneous change in interest rates and utilize various assumptions, including, but not limited to, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, reinvestment and replacement of asset and liability cash flows.
We also analyze the economic value of equity as a secondary measure of interest rate risk. This is a complementary measure to net interest income where the calculated value is the result of the market value of assets less the market value of liabilities. The economic value of equity is a longer term view of interest rate risk because it measures the present value of the future cash flows. The impact of changes in interest rates on this calculation is analyzed for the risk to our future earnings and is used in conjunction with the analyses on net interest income.
Our interest rate risk model indicated that the Company was asset sensitive in terms of interest rate sensitivity at December 31, 2020 and 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, our asset sensitivity increased slightly for a rising rate environment as a result of the balance sheet mix. The table below illustrates the impact of an immediate and sustained 200 and 100 basis point increase and a 25 basis point decrease in interest rates on net interest income based on the interest rate risk model at December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Many assumptions are used to calculate the impact of interest rate fluctuations. Actual results may be significantly different than our projections due to several factors, including the timing and frequency of rate changes, market conditions and the shape of the yield curve. The computations of interest rate risk shown above do not include actions that management may undertake to manage the risks in response to anticipated changes in interest rates and actual results may also differ due to any actions taken in response to the changing rates.
As part of the asset/liability management strategy to manage primary market risk exposures expected to be in effect in future reporting periods, management has emphasized a balanced approach to loan origination with an emphasis on shorter duration loans as well as variable rate loans given the current low rate environment. The strategy with respect to liabilities has been to continue to emphasize transaction account growth, particularly non-interest or low interest bearing non-maturing deposit accounts while building long-term client relationships. Non-maturing deposit accounts totaled 82.6% of total deposits at December 31, 2020, compared to 77.7% at December 31, 2019. We currently have no brokered time deposits.
Off-Balance Sheet Activities
In the normal course of business, we are a party to various contractual obligations, commitments and other off-balance sheet activities that contain credit, market, and operational risk that are not required to be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. The most significant of these are the loan commitments that we enter into to meet the financing needs of clients, including commitments to extend credit, commercial and consumer lines of credit and standby letters of credit. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had loan commitments totaling $848.6 million and $850.3 million, respectively, and standby letters of credit that totaled $7.3 million and $11.9 million, respectively. Unused commitments do not necessarily represent future credit exposure or cash requirements, as commitments often expire without being drawn upon. We do not anticipate any material losses arising from commitments or contingent liabilities, and we do not believe that there are any material commitments to extend credit that represent risks of an unusual nature.
Contractual Obligations
In addition to the financing commitments detailed above under “Off-Balance Sheet Activities,” in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual obligations that require future cash settlement. The following table summarizes the contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2020 and the expected timing of those payments:
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increasing operating costs and non-interest expense. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than do changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices. Interest rate changes do not necessarily move in the same direction, nor have the same magnitude, as changes in the prices of goods and services. Although not as critical to the banking industry as many other industries, inflationary factors may have some impact on our ability to grow, total assets, earnings and capital levels. We do not expect inflation to be a significant factor in our financial results in the near future.
