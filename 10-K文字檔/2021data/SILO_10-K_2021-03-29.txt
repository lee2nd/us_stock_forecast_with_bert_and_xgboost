ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and plan of operations together with and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All amounts in this report are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.
Overview
We are a developmental stage biopharmaceutical company focused on merging traditional therapeutics with psychedelic research. We seek to acquire assets to license and fund research which we believe will be transformative to the well-being of patients and the health care industry, and we are committed to developing innovative solutions to address a variety of underserved conditions. In these uncertain times, the mental health of the nation and beyond is being put to the test. More than ever, creative new therapies are needed to address the health challenges of today. Combining our resources with world-class medical research partners, we hope to make significant advances in the medical and psychedelic space.
Our strategy is to acquire and/or develop intellectual property or technology rights from leading universities and researchers to treat rare diseases, including the use of psychedelic drugs, such as psilocybin, and the potential benefits they may have in certain cases involving depression, mental health issues and neurological disorders. We intend to focus on merging traditional therapeutics with psychedelic research for people suffering from indications such as depression, PTSD, Parkinson’s, and other rare neurological disorders. Our mission is to identify assets to license and fund the research which we believe will be transformative to the well-being of patients and the health care industry.
The potential of psilocybin therapy in mental health conditions has been demonstrated in a number of academic-sponsored studies over the last decade. In these early studies, it was observed that psilocybin therapy provided rapid reductions in depression symptoms after a single high dose, with antidepressant effects lasting for up to at least six months for a number of patients. These studies assessed symptoms related to depression and anxiety through a number of widely used and validated scales. The data generated by these studies suggest that psilocybin is generally well-tolerated and has the potential to treat depression when administered with psychological support.
We have recently engaged in discussions with a number of world-renowned educational institutions and advisors regarding potential opportunities and have formed a scientific advisory board that is intended to help advise management regarding potential acquisition and development of products. In addition, we entered into certain sponsored research and/or license agreements, as more fully described below, and are seeking to enter into additional scientific research agreements and partnerships with other universities.
License Agreements
License Agreement with the University of Baltimore, Maryland
On February 12, 2021, we entered the UMB License Agreement with the UMB pursuant to which UMB granted us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license to certain intellectual property (i) to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, and import certain licensed products and (ii) to use the invention titled, “Central nervous system-homing peptides in vivo and their use for the investigation and treatment of multiple sclerosis and other neuroinflammatory pathology” and UMB’s confidential information to develop and perform certain licensed processes for the therapeutic treatment of neuroinflammatory disease. Pursuant to the UMB License Agreement, we agreed to pay UMB (i) a license fee of $75,000, (ii) certain event-based milestone payments, (iii) royalty payments, depending on net revenues, (iv) minimum royalty payments, and (v) a tiered percentage of sublicense income. The UMB License Agreement will remain in effect until the later of: (a) the last patent covered under the UMB License Agreement expires, (b) the expiration of data protection, new chemical entity, orphan drug exclusivity, regulatory exclusivity, or other legally enforceable market exclusivity, if applicable, or (c) ten years after the first commercial sale of a licensed product in that country, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the UMB License Agreement.

The UMB License Agreement followed the UMB Option Agreement pursuant to which we had previously obtained an exclusive option to negotiate and obtain an exclusive, sublicensable license from UMB.
Patent License Agreement with AIkido Pharma Inc.
On January 5, 2021, we entered into the AIkido License Agreement with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Silo Pharma, Inc., and AIkido pursuant to which we granted AIkido an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license to certain intellectual property (i) to make, have made, use, provide, import, export, lease, distribute, sell, offer for sale, develop and advertise certain licensed products and (ii) to develop and perform certain licensed processes for the treatment of cancer and symptoms caused by cancer. The AIkido License Agreement related to the rights which we had obtained under the UMB Option Agreement. Pursuant to the AIkido License Agreement, we agreed that if we exercised the UMB Option, we would grant AIkido a non-exclusive sublicense to certain UMB patent rights in the field of neuroinflammatory diseases occurring in patients diagnosed with cancer. The UMB Option was exercised on January 13, 2021. Accordingly, on February 12, 2021, we entered into a binding letter of intent with AIkido pursuant to which we agreed to grant AIkido a worldwide, exclusive sublicense of our patents under the UMB License Agreement (see below).
Pursuant to the AIkido License Agreement, AIkido agreed to pay us, among other things, (i) a one-time non-refundable cash payment of $500,000 and (ii) royalty payments equal to 2% of Net Sales (as defined in the AIkido License Agreement) in the field of use in the territory covered by such agreement. In addition, AIkido issued us 500 shares of its Series M Convertible Preferred Stock. The AIkido License Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration or abandonment of all issued patents and filed patent applications within the licensed patents set forth in the AIkido License Agreement, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the AIkido License Agreement.
Binding Letter of Intent to Grant Sublicense with AIkido Pharma Inc.
Following the execution of the UMB License Agreement, and in accordance with the terms of the AIkido License Agreement, we entered into the Letter of Intent with AIkido, on February 12, 2021, pursuant to which we agreed to grant AIkido a worldwide, exclusive sublicense of our licensed patents under the UMB License Agreement for use in the therapeutic treatment of neuroinflammatory disease in cancer patients. Pursuant to the Letter of Intent, AIkido agreed to pay us (i) a one-time license fee of $50,000 and (ii) the same royalty payments that we are subject to under the UMB License Agreement. We have agreed to use our best efforts to complete the sublicense arrangement as soon as reasonably possible. The terms and conditions of the sublicense are subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of the UMB License Agreement, including, but not limited to, the provisions regarding the granting of sublicenses set forth in the UMB License Agreement.
Investigator-Sponsored Study Agreements
Investigator-Sponsored Study Agreement with Maastricht University of the Netherlands
On November 1, 2020, we entered into an investigator-sponsored study agreement with Maastricht University of the Netherlands. The research project is a clinical study to examine the effects of repeated low doses of psilocybin and LSD on cognitive and emotional dysfunctions in Parkinson’s disease and to understand its mechanism of action. The agreement shall terminate on October 31, 2024, unless earlier terminated pursuant to the terms thereof. We shall pay a total fee of 433,885 Euros ($507,602 USD) exclusive of value added tax based on a payment schedule set forth in the agreement.
Investigator-Sponsored Study Agreement with UMB
On January 5, 2021, we entered into an investigator-sponsored study agreement with UMB. The research project is a clinical study to examine a novel peptide-guided drug delivery approach for the treatment of MS. More specifically, the study is designed to evaluate (1) whether MS-1-displaying liposomes can effectively deliver dexamethasone to the central nervous system and (2) whether MS-1-displaying liposomes are superior to plain liposomes, also known as free drug, in inhibiting the relapses and progression of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis. Pursuant to the agreement, the research shall commence on March 1, 2021 and will continue until substantial completion, subject to renewal upon mutual written consent of the parties. The total cost under the Sponsored Study Agreement shall not exceed $81,474.
Recent Financing
February 2021 Private Placement
On February 9, 2021, we entered into securities purchase agreements with certain institutional and accredited investors pursuant to which, on February 12, 2021, we sold an aggregate of 4,276 shares of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase up to 14,253,323 shares of our common stock in a private placement for gross proceeds of approximately $4,276,000, before deducting placement agent and other offering expenses. The warrants are exercisable for a period of five years from the date of issuance at an exercise price of $0.30 per share, subject to adjustment, and subject to certain exceptions, may be exercised on a cashless basis. In connection with the offering, we entered into separate registration rights agreements with the investors pursuant to which we agreed to file a registration statement to register the resale of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants which we initially filed on February 16, 2021. Pursuant to the terms of the offering, we issued the placement agents warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,850,664 shares of our common stock. The placement agent warrants are exercisable for a period of five years from the closing date of the offering at an exercise price of $0.35 per share, subject to adjustment.
Going Concern
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, we had a net loss of $3,037,517 and $1,013,294 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we used cash in operations of $1,156,996. Additionally, we had an accumulated deficit $5,762,321 at December 31, 2020 and have generated minimal revenues under our new business plan. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from the issuance date of this report. Management cannot provide assurance that we will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive or raise additional debt and/or equity capital. We are seeking to raise capital through additional debt and/or equity financings to fund our operations in the future. If we are unable to raise additional capital or secure additional lending in the near future to fund our business plan, management expects that we will need to curtail our operations. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. We are monitoring this closely, and although operations have not been materially affected by the COVID-19 outbreak to date, the ultimate duration and severity of the outbreak and its impact on the economic environment and our business is uncertain. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business, including weakened demand for our products and a decreased ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. At this time, we are unable to estimate the impact of this event on its operations.
Equity Investments
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, equity investments, at cost of $200 and $9,394, respectively, comprised mainly of nonmarketable common stock and stock warrants, are recorded at cost, as adjusted for other than temporary impairment write-downs and are evaluated for impairment periodically.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded bad debt expense of $165,376. The Company recorded an allowance on bad debt of $146,500 and wrote off interest receivable of $27,876 on a note receivable during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to slow collection of the installment payments pursuant to the agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded bad debt recovery $13,500 from the collection of a previously written off note receivable deemed uncollectible.
● Selling, general and administrative expenses:
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of non-cash amortization expense of intangible assets, advertising and promotion, transfer agent fees, custodian fees, bank service charges, travel, and other fees and expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, selling, general and administrative expenses were $120,842 and $87,013, respectively, an increase of $33,829, or 38.9%. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributed to an increase in advertising and promotion expense, EDGAR filing fees, and other expenses related to our new business operations.
● Impairment loss
At December 31, 2019, based on management’s impairment analysis, we recorded an impairment loss of $29,440 due to the impairment of trademarks as compared to $0 during the year ended December 31, 2020. We determined that there was a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use our trademarks.
Loss from Operations:

Other (Expenses) Income:
For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, other expenses, net amounted to $464,550 and $82,891, respectively, an increase of $381,659 or 460%, and such increase is discussed below.
● Interest income:
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we earned interest income of $11,543 and $12,196, respectively, primarily resulting from interest earned on notes receivable. The decrease was attributable to the decrease in income-earning notes receivable as a result of principal collections.
● Interest expense:
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred interest expense of $269,043 primarily related to borrowings under convertible debt agreements which included amortization of debt discount to interest expense of $268,125. All convertible notes were exchanged into common stock during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred interest expense of $62,739 primarily related to the increase in borrowings under convertible debt agreements and included amortization of debt discount to interest expense of $61,875.
● Net realized gain on equity investments:
For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a net realized gain on equity investments of $138,032 primarily attributed to a gain from the sale of our remaining equity investment in Ipsidy, Inc. We did not have such realized gain during year 2020.
● Net change in unrealized loss on equity investments:
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded an unrealized loss on equity investments of $170,191 attributable to our analysis of the fair value of our investment in Ipsidy, Inc. and other equity investments as compared to $9,194 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
● Loss on debt extinguishment, net:
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded loss on debt extinguishment of $197,682 due to the exchange of the convertible notes into common stock pursuant to exchange agreements with the holders of our convertible promissory notes issued in October 2019 and with the holders of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and an offset of $318 of gain from debt extinguishment related to a settlement agreement with a vendor. We did not have such loss during year 2019.
Net Loss:
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, net loss amounted to $3,037,517 or $(0.05) per common share (basic and diluted), and $1,013,294 or $(0.04) per common share (basic and diluted), respectively, a change of $2,047,723, or 202.1%. The increase was primarily a result of the increase in operating expenses, and other expenses, net discussed above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. We had a working capital of $1,284,941 and $1,128,389 in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020 and working capital of $377,108 and $111,752 in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2019.

We received net proceeds of $295,000, net of original issue discount of $30,000 and fees of $5,000. The Notes were due and payable in October 2020. Prior to an event of default, no interest shall accrue on these Notes. On April 15, 2020, we entered into exchange agreements with the holders of the Notes, which notes were originally issued in October 2019. Pursuant to such exchange agreements, the holders agreed to exchange their Notes and 1,650,000 Warrants issued in connection with this debt for an aggregate of 4,125,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.08 per share.

Net Cash Provided by Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities was $39,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $186,741 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of proceeds from collection on note receivable. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of proceeds from the sale of equity securities of $191,938 offset by the purchase of equity investment, at a fair value of $5,197.
Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $2,134,633 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $382,656 for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received net proceeds from sale of common stock of $2,115,733, related party loans of $35,000, proceeds from a note payable of $18,900 offset by repayment on notes payable - related party of $35,000. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we received net proceeds from the sale of Series B Preferred Stock of $110,000, net proceeds from the convertible debt of $295,000, and proceeds from related party loan of $25,000 offset by the repayment of insurance finance loan of $22,344 and the repayment of related party loan $25,000.
Cash Requirements
We believe that our existing available cash will not be enough to enable us to meet the working capital requirements for at least 12 months from the date of this report. Our primary uses of cash have been for salaries, fees paid to third parties for professional services, and general and administrative expenses. The following trends are reasonably likely to result in changes in our liquidity over the near to long term:
● An increase in working capital requirements to finance our current business;
● An increase in product development and marketing fees;
● Addition of administrative and sales personnel as the business grows; and
● The cost of being a public company.
Since we believe that our existing available cash will not enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least 12 months from the date of this report, we will need to raise additional funds for the development and marketing of our potential product candidates. If we are unable to raise capital, we may be required to reduce the scope of our product development and marketing activities, which could harm our business plans, financial condition and operating results, cease our operations entirely, in which case, you will lose all of your investment.
Management cannot provide assurance that we will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive or raise additional debt and/or equity capital. We will seek to raise capital through additional debt and/or equity financings to fund operations, for product development and for marketing in the future. If we are unable to raise capital or secure lending in the near future, management expects that we may need to curtail or cease our operations.
Until such time as we generate substantial product revenue to offset operational expenses, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public and private equity offerings and debt financing. We may be unable to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed or on favorable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition. We have no agreements or arrangements to raise capital.
We currently have no material commitments for any capital expenditures.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K or any commitments or contractual obligations.
Critical Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, (“U.S. GAAP”).
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less and money market accounts to be cash equivalents.
Inventory
Inventory, consisting of raw materials and finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value utilizing the first-in, first-out method. A reserve is established when management determines that certain inventories may not be saleable. If inventory costs exceed expected net realizable value due to obsolescence or quantities in excess of expected demand, we will record reserves for the difference between the cost and the net realizable value. These reserves shall be recorded based on estimates and included in cost of sales. Additionally, we shall make an analysis of our inventory for any slow-moving inventory. Accordingly, we shall reclass sellable inventories that may not be sold in one year to non-current assets.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization, computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. Intangible assets consist of a brand ambassador agreement which was being amortized over a period of one year and trademarks which are recorded at cost and have an indefinite useful life and are not amortized.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
In accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 360, we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, or at least annually. We recognize an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset’s estimated fair value and its book value.
Equity Investments
Equity investments comprised mainly of nonmarketable common stock and membership interests, are recorded at cost, as adjusted for other than temporary impairment write-downs and are evaluated for impairment periodically.
Net Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Gains or Losses on Investments
Realized gain or loss is recognized when an investment is disposed of and is computed as the difference between the our cost basis and the net proceeds received from such disposition. Realized gains and losses on investment transactions are determined by specific identification. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation is computed as the difference between the fair value of the investment and the cost basis of such investment, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation/depreciation when gains or losses are realized.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements
We use the guidance of ASC Topic 820 for fair value measurements which clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
Level 1-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.
Level 2-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.
The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash, notes receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses, note payable - related party, and convertible notes payable approximate their fair market value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments.
Revenue Recognition
We apply ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). ASC 606 establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition guidance. This standard requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services and also requires certain additional disclosures. We adopted this standard using the modified retrospective approach, which requires applying the new standard to all existing contracts not yet completed as of the effective date and recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 did not have any impact on the process for, timing of, and presentation and disclosure of revenue recognition from contracts and there was no cumulative effect adjustment.
We record interest and dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts.
Product sales are recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and title is transferred and are recorded net of any discounts or allowances.
Stock-based Compensation
Stock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718 - “Compensation -Stock Compensation”, which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee, director, or non-employee is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. We have elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur as permitted under ASU 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment.
Income Taxes
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as measured by the enacted tax rates, which are expected to be in effect when these differences reverse. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current, depending upon the classification of the asset or liabilities to which they relate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities not related to an asset or liability are classified as current or non-current depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
We follow the provisions of FASB ASC 740-10, “Uncertainty in Income Taxes”. Certain recognition thresholds must be met before a tax position is recognized in the financial statements. An entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a “more-likely-than-not” threshold. We do not believe we have any uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 that would require either recognition or disclosure in the accompanying financial statements.
