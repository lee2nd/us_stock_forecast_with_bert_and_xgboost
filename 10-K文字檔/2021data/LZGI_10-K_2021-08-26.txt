ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Executive Overview
We have not recorded revenues from operations since inception and lack revenues to cover our operating costs. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are currently devoting our efforts to obtain capital from management, significant stockholders and/or third parties to cover minimal expenses; however, there is no assurance that additional funding will be available. Our ability to continue as a going concern during the long term is dependent upon our ability to find a suitable company and acquire or enter into a merger with such company.
The type of business opportunity with which we acquire or merge will affect our profitability for long term. We may consider a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may occur through a public offering.
Our management has not had any preliminary contact or discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us. Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may complete a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks.
Our management anticipates that we will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management’s plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.
We anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions, the COVID-19 pandemic’s effect on businesses, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking even the limited additional capital which we will have and/or the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At May 31, 2021, we had cash of $4,735 and total liabilities of $294,610 compared to cash of $1,834 and total liabilities of $261,867 at May 31, 2020. We have not established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover our operating costs. During the year ended May 31, 2021 and 2020, we relied upon advances and notes payable from related parties to fund our operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are currently devoting our efforts to obtaining capital from management, significant stockholders and/or third parties to cover minimal operations; however, there is no assurance that additional funding will be available. Our ability to continue as a going concern during the long term is dependent upon our ability to find a suitable business opportunity and acquire or enter into a merger with such a company.
During the next 12 months we anticipate incurring costs related to the filing of Exchange Act reports, and possibly investigating, analyzing and consummating an acquisition. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through funds provided by management, significant stockholders and third parties.
Results of Operations
We did not record revenues in 2021 or 2020. General and administrative expenses increased 6.2% for 2021 ($13,800) compared to 2020 ($13,000). Total other expense increased 8.6 % for 2021 ($16,042) compared to 2020 ($14,771), primarily due to interest on loans.
Our net loss increased 7.5% for 2021 ($29,842) compared to 2020 ($27,771). Management expects net losses to continue until we acquire or merge with a business opportunity.
Obligations
We have relied upon loans and advances to fund our operational expenses. On May 31, 2018, a stockholder converted $92,500 of its accounts payable to a promissory note which bears interest at 8% per annum and is due on demand. On May 31, 2021, the stockholder converted $6,000 of its accounts payable to a promissory note which bears interest at 8% per annum and is due on demand, resulting in a total balance owed of $119,200. Interest expense was $9,056 and $8,163 for the years ended May 31, 2021 and 2020, and accrued interest on the notes totaled $24,745 and $15,689 at May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. (See Item 13, below)
At May 31, 2021 and 2020 we owed a third party $69,800 and $59,100, respectively. The loans incurred interest expense of $5,107 and $4,728 for 2021 and 2020, respectively, and accrued interest on the loan totaled $30,048 and $24,941 at May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These loans are payable upon demand, are not collateralized and bear interest at 8% per annum.
During the years ended May 31, 2009 and 2010, our Director and President, Greg L. Popp, loaned an aggregate of $23,500 to the Company. On April 20, 2010, these loans were combined into one promissory note which carries interest at 8% and is not collateralized. The original promissory note had a due date of June 30, 2012; however, Mr. Popp agreed to extend the due date of the principal and interest on this note to June 30, 2022. Interest expense was $1,880 for each of the years ended May 31, 2021 and 2020, and accrued interest on the notes totaled $21,217 and $19,337 at May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. (See Item 13, below)
Emerging Growth Company
We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). A company qualifies as an emerging growth company if it has total annual gross revenues of less than $1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year and, as of December 8, 2011, had not sold common equity securities under a registration statement. Under the JOBS Act we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
The Company has evaluated Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 regarding the impact of the decreased tax rates of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act. See “Note 3 - Income Taxes” in the notes to our financial statements for schedules that describe the new rates adjusted in the period enacted.
