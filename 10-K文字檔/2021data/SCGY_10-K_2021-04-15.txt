Overview
The Company conducts business primarily through its wholly owned subsidiary Sinoforte Ltd., a Hong Kong corporation.
Prior to August 2011, the Company operated primarily as a merchant, buying and selling various type and grades of graphite, such as medium- and high-carbon graphite, high-purity graphite, micro-powder graphite and expandable graphite. As a merchant, the Company acted as a reseller. It purchased graphite products in bulk, primarily from graphite producers, and resold them, either in bulk or in smaller quantities (in either case, without further processing), to various small and mid-sized customers.
In August 2011, the Company started to engage in a business of e-commerce platform. Currently the Company is in the process of developing a website, “Makeliving.com” ("Makeliving"), which provides an e-commerce platform, where registered members can exchange goods and services. Makeliving will act both as a platform and as a conduit between those (individuals or companies) who desire to acquire goods and services and those (individuals or companies) who desire to offer goods and services. Makeliving plans to charge a certain percentage fee for the transactions. However, no revenues have been generated. The activities of the website are currently suspended.
On January 23, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with Cityhill Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Elate Holdings Limited, a Hong Kong listed public company, pursuant to which parties agreed to establish a joint venture (the “Joint Venture”). Each party owns 50% equity interest in the Joint Venture respectively.
The Venture Joint, with the support of blockchain technology, is to provide global trading service of physical gold for global customers. The parties contribute their respective experiences in blockchain technology and marketing. The Company will assist the Joint Venture in exploring the North America and Europe markets, while Cityhill will focus on the Asian markets.

Going Concern
The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had a net loss of $461,519 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and had an accumulated deficit of $9,301,091 as of December 31, 2020. The Company has not yet established an adequate ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease development of operations. Moreover, the Company may be continuously raising capital through the sale of debt and equity securities.
The Company’s ability to achieve these objectives cannot be determined at this stage. If the Company is unsuccessful in its endeavors, it may be forced to cease operations. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty which may include adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
These factors have raised substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to obtain adequate financing or achieve profitability. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty

Until we are able to generate sufficient liquidity from operations, we intend to continue to fund operations from cash on-hand, and through private debt or equity placements of our securities. Our continued operations will depend on whether we are able to generate sufficient liquidity from operations and/or raise additional capital through such sources as equity and debt financings, collaborative and licensing agreements and strategic alliances. There can be no assurance that additional capital will become available or, if it does, that it will become available on acceptable terms, or that any additional capital we may obtain will be sufficient to meet our long-term needs. We currently have no commitments for any additional capital, both internally and externally.

Critical Accounting Policies
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We re-evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently applied. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
