You should read this report completely and with the understanding that actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. The forward-looking statements included in this report are made as of the date of this report and should be evaluated with consideration of any changes occurring after the date of this Report.

Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Revenues:
The Company’s revenues were $1,379,580 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1,589,728 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to the impact of COVID-19.
Cost of Sales:
The Company’s cost of materials was $455,360 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1,209,341 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to the impact of COVID-19.
Operating Expenses:
Operating expenses consisted primarily of consulting fees, professional fees, salaries and wages, office expenses and fees associated with preparing reports and SEC filings relating to being a public company. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, were $9,905,885 and $974,624, respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to share-based compensation pursuant to Licensing and Distribution Agreements.
Other Income (Expense):
Other income (expense) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $(7,343,185) and $10,685,542, respectively. Other income (expense) consisted of gain or loss on derivative valuation, gain or loss on disposal of assets, goodwill impairment and interest expense. The gain or loss on derivative valuation is directly attributable to the change in fair value of the derivative liability. Interest expense is primarily attributable the initial interest expense associated with the valuation of derivative instruments at issuance and the accretion of the convertible debentures over their respective terms. The variance primarily resulted from the fluctuation of the Company’s stock price which impacted the valuation of the derivative liabilities on the convertible debt.
Net Profit (Loss):
Net profit (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $(16,324,850), compared with $10,091,305 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decreased profit can be explained by the increase in share-based consulting fees and the loss in fair value of the derivative instruments in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Impact of Inflation
We believe that the rate of inflation has had a negligible effect on our operations.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $72,764 and $597,016 in cash and total assets, as well as $4,766,420 in total liabilities as compared to $1,444 and $949,010 in cash and total assets, and $6,810,483 in total liabilities as of December 31, 2019. The decrease in assets was due to a decrease in accounts receivable. The decrease in total liabilities was primarily attributed to a decrease in notes payable and interest due to note holder conversions to common stock.
The Company requires additional capital to fully execute its marketing program and increase revenues. Presently we are relying on short term loans from our sole officer and director to meet operational shortfalls. There can be no assurance that continued funding will be available on satisfactory terms. We intend to raise additional capital through the sale of equity, loans or other short-term financing options.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash from (used in) operating activities was $(964,667) compared to $(68,516) for the year ended December 31, 2019. The variance is primarily resulted from the loss on derivative liabilities, loss on conversions and share-based compensation reported in 2020.
During the year ended December 31, 2020 cash from (used in) investing activities was $(33,823) compared to $22,408 for the year ended December 30, 2018. The variance is primary due to fixed asset additions in 2020 and fixed asset disposals in 2019.
During the year ended December 30, 2020, cash from financing activity was $1,069,810 compared to $4,267 for the year ended December 30, 2019. The variance primarily resulted from an increase in proceeds from convertible and promissory notes during the year ended December 30, 2020.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.
Significant Accounting Policies
Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, warranty liabilities, share-based payments, income taxes and litigation. We base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. We believe that the significant accounting policies and assumptions as detailed in Note 1 to the financial statements contained herein may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others.
Emerging Growth Company
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:
● have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
● comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);
● submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay” and “say-on-frequency;” and
● disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO’s compensation to median employee compensation.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
We will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.
Contractual Obligations
We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.
