We are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a) (19) of the Securities Act. Pursuant to Section 107 of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, we may take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, meaning that we can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have chosen to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies to delay adoption of such standards until such standards are made applicable to private companies. Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
OVERVIEW:
Historical Development
Sigyn Therapeutics, Inc. (“Sigyn” or the “Company”) was established on October 29, 2019 in the State of Delaware. We are a development-stage therapeutic technology company that is headquartered in San Diego, California USA. Our primary focus is directed toward a significant unmet need in global health: the treatment of acute life-threatening inflammatory conditions that are precipitated by Cytokine Storm Syndrome (“The Cytokine Storm” or “Cytokine Release Syndrome”) and not addressed with approved drug therapies. Cytokine Storm Syndrome is a dysregulated immune response that can be induced by a wide range of infectious and non-infectious conditions. A hallmark of the Cytokine Storm is an over-production of inflammatory cytokines, which can destroy tissue, trigger multiple-organ failure and cause death.
On October 19, 2020, Reign Resources Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “Registrant”) completed a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Agreement”) with our organization (Sigyn Therapeutics) that resulted in the registrant acquiring 100% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock in exchange for 75% of the fully paid and nonassessable shares of the Registrant’s common stock outstanding (the “Acquisition”). In conjunction with the transaction, the Registrant changed its name to Sigyn Therapeutics, Inc. pursuant to an amendment to its articles of incorporation that was filed with the State of Delaware. Subsequently, the Registrant’s trading symbol was changed to SIGY. The Acquisition was treated as a “tax-free exchange” under Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and resulted in the Sigyn corporate entity (established on October 29, 2019) to become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant. Among the conditions for closing the acquisition, the Registrant extinguished all previously reported liabilities, its preferred class of shares, and all stock purchase options. As a result, the reported liabilities totaling $3,429,516 converted into a total of 7,907,351 common shares. Additionally, assets held on the books of Reign Resources Corporation, such as Gem inventory, was kept in the Company and therefore recorded as assets on the Share Exchange date. The Registrant’s Board of Directors appointed James A. Joyce and Craig P. Roberts to serve as members of the Registrant’s Board of Directors upon closing of the Acquisition.
As of April 5, 2021, we have a total 35,248,513 shares issued and outstanding, of which 9,561,513 shares are held by non-affiliate shareholders.
About Sigyn Therapy
Sigyn Therapy is a novel blood purification technology designed to mitigate cytokine storm syndrome through the broad-spectrum depletion of inflammatory targets from the bloodstream. Sigyn Therapy’s mechanism of action allows for it to be implemented on the established infrastructure of dialysis and CRRT machines that are already located in hospitals and clinics worldwide. Cytokine Storm Syndrome is a hallmark of sepsis, which is the most common cause of in-hospital deaths and claims more lives each year than all forms of cancer combined. Virus induced cytokine storm (VICS) is associated with high mortality and is a leading cause of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) deaths. Other therapeutic opportunities include but are not limited to bacteria induced cytokine storm (BICS), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute forms of liver failure such as Hepatic Encephalopathy, which is associated with elevated levels of toxins and inflammatory cytokines in the bloodstream.
Recent Developments
On December 1, 2020, we reported the results of an in vitro study that validated the ability of Sigyn Therapy to simultaneously deplete a broad-spectrum of critical inflammatory targets from human blood plasma. In the study, Sigyn Therapy reduced the presence of endotoxin and relevant pro-inflammatory cytokines, which included Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-a). Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide or LPS) is a well-known inflammatory trigger implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis and septic shock resulting from gram-negative bacterial infections. The dysregulated over-production of IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF-a is known to induce organ failure and cause death. An objective of the study was to rebalance elevated cytokine levels and optimize the elimination of endotoxin from human blood plasma. The study was conducted in triplicate over four-hour time periods with a pediatric version of Sigyn Therapy. Average reduction of endotoxin load peaked at 83% during the studies. The average reduction of IL-1b was 69%, IL-6 reduction was 59% and TNF-a reduction was 57% during the four-hour studies. We plan to incorporate this data into an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) that we expect to submit to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prior to the end of the 2021 calendar year. Our IDE submission will request permission to initiate U.S. human feasibility studies with a primary objective to demonstrate that Sigyn Therapy can be safely administered to subjects diagnosed with a Cytokine Storm Syndrome related condition. There is no assurance that FDA will approve our IDE submission to permit human studies.
We are also evaluating the ability of Sigyn Therapy to address CytoVesicles that transport inflammatory cytokine cargos throughout the bloodstream. Based on recent peer-reviewed publications and emerging scientific evidence, we believe the simultaneous clearance of circulating CytoVesicles, endotoxin and inflammatory cytokines may overcome the limitations of previous drug and medical device candidates to treat sepsis and other life-threatening inflammatory conditions.
On January 6, 2021, we disclosed the results of an in vitro pilot study that modeled the ability of the adsorbent components we incorporate within Sigyn Therapy to address CytoVesicles. CytoVesicles (extracellular vesicles that transport inflammatory cytokine cargos) participate in concert with freely circulating cytokines to further escalate the Cytokine Storm. CytoVesicles have previously been elusive targets for extracorporeal blood purification therapies as they can be 20-50 times larger than cytokines themselves. In our in vitro pilot study, 104 nanometer liposomes were utilized as a model system to assess the ability of Sigyn Therapy’s adsorbent components to deplete CytoVesicles from human blood plasma. After a two-hour interaction with our cocktail of adsorbent components, liposome concentrations in human blood plasma were reduced ~90%. Previously published studies have validated liposomes as a model for the isolation of extracellular vesicles from blood based on the similarity of their size and structural characteristics. There is no assurance that any in vitro study outcome of Sigyn Therapy or its components will translate into similar performance outcomes in human studies.
We began our planned principal operations, and accordingly, we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).

Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital
There is limited historical financial information about us on which to base an evaluation of our performance. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, and possible cost overruns due to increases in the cost of services. To become profitable and competitive, we must receive additional capital. We have no assurance that future financing will materialize. If that financing is not available, we may be unable to continue operations.
Overview of Presentation
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) or Plan of Operations includes the following sections:
● Results of Operations
● Liquidity and Capital Resources
● Capital Expenditures
● Going Concern
● Critical Accounting Policies
● Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and professional fees required to support our operations and growth.
Depending on the extent of our future growth, we may experience significant strain on our management, personnel, and information systems. We will need to implement and improve operational, financial, and management information systems. In addition, we are implementing new information systems that will provide better record-keeping, customer service and billing. However, there can be no assurance that our management resources or information systems will be sufficient to manage any future growth in our business, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The following is a summary of our cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities during the periods indicated:
Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Date of Formation (October 29, 2019) through December 31, 2019
Cash Flows from Operating Activities - For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operations was $829,809 compared to net cash used in operations of $0 from date of formation (October 29, 2019) through December 31, 2019. Net cash used in operations was primarily due to a net loss of $1,259,590 for year ended December 31, 2020 and the changes in operating assets and liabilities of $75,325, primarily due to the increase in accounts payable of $15,095, accrued payroll and payroll taxes of $59,707, and other current liabilities of $523.

Financing - We expect that our current working capital position, together with our expected future cash flows from operations will be insufficient to fund our operations in the ordinary course of business, anticipated capital expenditures, debt payment requirements and other contractual obligations for at least the next twelve months. However, this belief is based upon many assumptions and is subject to numerous risks, and there can be no assurance that we will not require additional funding in the future.
We have no present agreements or commitments with respect to any material acquisitions of other businesses, products, product rights or technologies or any other material capital expenditures. However, we will continue to evaluate acquisitions of and/or investments in products, technologies, capital equipment or improvements or companies that complement our business and may make such acquisitions and/or investments in the future. Accordingly, we may need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to finance any such acquisitions and/or investments. We may not be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Due to the ongoing global economic crisis, we believe it may be difficult to obtain additional financing if needed. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our shareholders, in the case of equity financing.

Capital Expenditures
Other Capital Expenditures
We expect to purchase approximately $30,000 of equipment in connection with the expansion of our business during the next twelve months.
Fiscal year end
Our fiscal year end is December 31.
Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $1,261,000 at December 31, 2020, had working capital of approximately $76,000 and a working capital deficit of $1,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, had a net loss of approximately $1,260,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, and net cash used in operating activities of approximately $830,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, with no revenue earned since inception, and a lack of operational history. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
While the Company is attempting to expand operations and increase revenues, the Company’s cash position may not be significant enough to support the Company’s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a private offering or an asset sale transaction. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. While management believes in the viability of its strategy to generate revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds or transact an asset sale, there can be no assurances to that effect or on terms acceptable to the Company. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to further implement its business plan and generate revenues.
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.
Critical Accounting Policies
The Commission has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require us to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies that are significant to understanding our results.
The following are deemed to be the most significant accounting policies affecting us.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements. The more significant estimates and assumptions by management include among others: inventory valuation, common stock valuation, and the recoverability of intangibles. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets consist primarily of developed technology - website. Our intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of three years.
Assignment of Patent
On January 8, 2020, James Joyce, the Company’s CEO and Craig Roberts, the Company’s COO, assigned to the Company the rights to patent 62/881,740 pertaining to the devices, systems and methods for the broad-spectrum reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines in blood.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
We periodically evaluate whether the carrying value of property, equipment and intangible assets has been impaired when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. The carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying value is not recoverable, the impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. There are no impairments as of December 31, 2020.
Our impairment analyses require management to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows as well as asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets, assessing the probability of different outcomes, and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. If the carrying value is not recoverable, we assess the fair value of long-lived assets using commonly accepted techniques, and may use more than one method, including, but not limited to, recent third-party comparable sales and discounted cash flow models. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to an impairment charge in the future. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and from inception (October 29, 2019) through December 31, 2019, the Company had not experienced impairment losses on its long-lived assets. However, there can be no assurances that the demand for the Company’s products and services will continue, which could result in an impairment of long-lived assets in the future.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach. This process involves calculating the temporary and permanent differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which would be recorded on our balance sheets in accordance with ASC 740, which established financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. We must assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. Changes in our valuation allowance in a period are recorded through the income tax provision on the consolidated Statements of Operations and comprehensive income.
From the date of our inception we adopted ASC 740-10-30. ASC 740-10 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740-10, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Additionally, ASC 740-10 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. As a result of the implementation of ASC 740-10, we recognized no material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The provisions of accounting guidance, FASB Topic ASC 825 requires all entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized on the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value, and defines fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and notes payable approximated carrying value due to the short maturity of the instruments, quoted market prices or interest rates which fluctuate with market rates.
Debt
We issue debt that may have separate warrants, conversion features, or no equity-linked attributes.
Debt with warrants - When we issue debt with warrants, we treat the warrants as a debt discount, record as a contra-liability against the debt, and amortize the balance over the life of the underlying debt as amortization of debt discount expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. When the warrants require equity treatment under ASC 815, the offset to the contra-liability is recorded as additional paid in capital in our consolidated balance sheet. When we issue debt with warrants that require liability treatment under ASC 815, such as a clause requiring repricing, the warrants are considered to be a derivative that is recorded as a liability at fair value. If the initial value of the warrant derivative liability is higher than the fair value of the associated debt, the excess is recognized immediately as interest expense. The warrant derivative liability is adjusted to its fair value at the end of each reporting period, with the change being recorded as expense or gain. If the debt is retired early, the associated debt discount is then recognized immediately as amortization of debt discount expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. The debt is treated as conventional debt.
Convertible debt - derivative treatment - When we issue debt with a conversion feature, we must first assess whether the conversion feature meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative, as follows: a) one or more underlyings, typically the price of our common stock; b) one or more notional amounts or payment provisions or both, generally the number of shares upon conversion; c) no initial net investment, which typically excludes the amount borrowed; and d) net settlement provisions, which in the case of convertible debt generally means the stock received upon conversion can be readily sold for cash. An embedded equity-linked component that meets the definition of a derivative does not have to be separated from the host instrument if the component qualifies for the scope exception for certain contracts involving an issuer’s own equity. The scope exception applies if the contract is both a) indexed to its own stock; and b) classified in shareholders’ equity in its statement of financial position.
If the conversion feature within convertible debt meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative, we estimate the fair value of the convertible debt derivative using Monte Carlo Method upon the date of issuance. If the fair value of the convertible debt derivative is higher than the face value of the convertible debt, the excess is immediately recognized as interest expense. Otherwise, the fair value of the convertible debt derivative is recorded as a liability with an offsetting amount recorded as a debt discount, which offsets the carrying amount of the debt. The convertible debt derivative is revalued at the end of each reporting period and any change in fair value is recorded as a gain or loss in the statements of operations and comprehensive income. The debt discount is amortized through interest expense over the life of the debt.
Convertible debt - beneficial conversion feature - If the conversion feature is not treated as a derivative, we assess whether it is a beneficial conversion feature (“BCF’). A BCF exists if the conversion price of the convertible debt instrument is less than the stock price on the commitment date. This typically occurs when the conversion price is less than the fair value of the stock on the date the instrument was issued. The value of a BCF is equal to the intrinsic value of the feature, the difference between the conversion price and the common stock into which it is convertible, and is recorded as additional paid in capital and as a debt discount in the consolidated balance sheet. We amortize the balance over the life of the underlying debt as amortization of debt discount expense in the statements of operations and comprehensive income. If the debt is retired early, the associated debt discount is then recognized immediately as amortization of debt discount expense in the statements of operations and comprehensive income.
If the conversion feature does not qualify for either the derivative treatment or as a BCF, the convertible debt is treated as traditional debt.
