Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
Overall
The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, temporarily lowered equity market valuations, created significant volatility in the financial markets, increased unemployment levels, caused temporary, and in certain cases, closures of many businesses. The gaming industry was not immune to these factors as our casino customers closed their gaming establishments, and as a result, our operations experienced significant disruptions. At the immediate onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were affected by various measures, including, but not limited to: the institution of social distancing and sheltering-in-place requirements in many states and communities, which significantly impacted demand for our products and services, and resulted in office closures, the furlough of a majority of our employees, the implementation of temporary base salary reductions for our employees and the implementation of a work-from-home policy.
In connection with the uncertainty facing our customers as a result of COVID-19, we evaluated our business strategies in the second quarter of 2020 and implemented measures to reduce our ongoing operating costs. As a result of this evaluation, we permanently reduced our employee base, with most of the departures resulting from our furloughed employees, to accommodate the current and future operating needs of our customers and our business. As the industry continues to evolve and recover from the impacts of the global pandemic, we will continue to evaluate our capabilities to support current and future business needs and adapt accordingly.
During the second quarter of 2020, businesses began to adapt to social-distancing measures and various phases of reopening pursuant to government-mandated guidelines. As our gaming customers reopened, a number of their properties initially experienced an elevated level of activity as compared to what was originally anticipated. The revenues generated by this initial pent-up demand flattened to slightly below pre-COVID levels as more casinos reopened through the second quarter of 2020. Revenues improved further throughout the third and fourth quarter of 2020, though they remained below pre-COVID levels. With a majority of our gaming customers reopening properties by the end of September 2020, and our activity rates and results continuing to improve through the third and fourth quarter, we have, among other measures: (i) returned nearly all of our furloughed employees to work on primarily a work-from-home basis; (ii) reinstated base compensation to pre-COVID levels for the employee base; (iii) reversed nearly all compensation reductions for both our Executives and Directors; and (iv) fully paid down the outstanding balance on our revolving line of credit.
It is unclear when and if customer volumes will return consistently to pre-COVID levels, if a resurgence of COVID-19 could result in the further or re-closure of casinos by federal, state, tribal or municipal governments, regulatory agencies, or by the casino operators themselves in an effort to contain the COVID-19 global pandemic or mitigate its impact and the impact of vaccines on these matters; however, we continue to monitor the impacts of COVID-19 and make adjustments to our business accordingly.
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates the risks disclosed in this Annual Report.
Results of Operations and Liquidity
To date, our operations have experienced revenue reductions and significant disruptions as a direct consequence of the circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. This had a material, adverse impact on our overall results of operations and financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2020. As such, we implemented a range of actions in 2020 to maintain balance sheet flexibility and preserve liquidity as a result of the business disruption caused by the rapid nationwide spread of COVID-19, including, but not limited to:
•At the onset of COVID-19 pandemic:
•we completed the full draw down of our available capacity of $35.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility in order to improve our liquidity and preserve financial flexibility in light of the uncertainty in our industry and the global economy as a result of COVID-19 (as discussed and defined in “Note 12 - Long-Term Debt”);
•we entered into a fourth amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to our existing Credit Agreement (as defined in “Note 12 - Long-Term Debt”), which among other things, amended our debt covenants to provide relief with respect to our senior secured leverage ratio (as discussed and defined in “Note 12 - Long-term Debt”);
•we also entered into a new credit agreement, which provides for a $125.0 million senior secured term loan, which is secured on a pari passu basis with the loans under our existing Credit Agreement. The entire amount was borrowed upon closing (as discussed and defined in “Note 12 - Long-term Debt”);
•our executive officers elected to accept significant reductions to their compensation during the pendency of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to better position the Company to withstand the challenging conditions that have caused global and domestic disruption in the current economic environment;
•our independent members of the Board of Directors of the Company elected to forgo their quarterly cash compensation for Board and related committee services;
•we furloughed a majority of our employee-base;
•we reduced the salaries of our employee-base from approximately 15% to 70%;
•we suspended certain employee benefits, such as providing a Company match on 401(k) contributions;
•we implemented a remote working environment;
•we canceled or delayed material capital expenditures; and
•we suspended our share repurchases under our previously authorized repurchase program;
•As of the end of the second quarter of 2020:
•we implemented a safe workplace return policy for those of our employees who returned to our facilities;
•we returned most of our furloughed employees to work;
•we returned a portion of base compensation to our executives;
•we returned most base compensation to our employee-base;
•we returned a portion of cash compensation to our Board of Directors;
•we completed a reduction-in-force and incurred severance costs, among other expenses, of approximately $2.7 million; and
•we recorded a write-down of assets of approximately $11.0 million, of which $9.2 million and $1.8 million related to our Games and FinTech businesses, respectively, for certain of our trade receivables, inventory, prepaid expenses and other assets, fixed assets and other intangible assets that were not expected to be recoverable. This charge was reflected in Operating Expenses of our Statements of Operations. While we are unable to determine the nature, or amount, of further write-down charges, it is possible that we may record additional amounts to the extent we experience a decline in operations and financial performance in the future.
•As of the end of the third quarter of 2020:
•we returned base compensation to our executives and employee-base;
•we returned cash compensation to our Board of Directors; and
•we fully repaid the $35.0 million Revolving Credit Facility in light of improved results of operations and liquidity.
•As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2020:
•we recorded a charge of approximately $2.0 million, of which $1.3 million and $0.7 million related to our Games and FinTech businesses, respectively, for costs related to the consolidation and exiting of certain facilities and the write-off of related inventory, reflecting the lower occupancy needs associated with our reduced employee-base, the increased proportion of employees working remotely and our streamlined operations. This charge was reflected in Operating Expenses of our Statements of Operations.
With respect to our Games and FinTech businesses, our revenues and results of operations were significantly lower for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the prior year. The following key factors that contributed to the reduced results, include, but were not limited to: (i) the closure of nearly all casino properties, both domestically and internationally, in March 2020, with the reopening process beginning in mid-to-late May 2020 with approximately 15% of properties still closed at the beginning of the third quarter of 2020 and approximately 10% still closed at the end of the third and fourth quarters of 2020; (ii) reopened casino properties operating at notably reduced capacity levels due to certain regulatory or governmental restrictions and or casino-elected implementation of health and safety protocols related to social distancing; (iii) certain gaming establishments voluntarily reclosing or considering a level of additionally reduced operations at certain of their properties as a result of increases in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19; and (iv) our revised focus internally to streamline operations and personnel to align with expectations going forward.
With respect to our financial condition, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were varying levels of impact to certain components of net working capital balances, including, but not limited to certain of our: (i) trade accounts receivable that increased in age as numerous customers delayed payments on certain outstanding balances; (ii) settlement receivables and settlement liabilities that decreased as these amounts fully settled for those customers who temporarily closed their casinos and that have not returned to pre-COVID total volume levels; (iii) finished goods inventory that increased as certain planned placements of our EGMs into the installed based or sold directly to our customers were either delayed or canceled by those customers; and (iv) accounts payable and accrued liabilities that increased as we made the decision to defer payments to preserve our available cash on hand.
Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, and continuing through the third and fourth quarters of 2020, we experienced an improvement in various components of net working capital associated with casino properties reopening that contributed to the increase in our cash and cash equivalents during those periods, as they are highly dependent upon the timing of cash access transactions; therefore, cash and cash equivalents can change substantially based upon the timing of our receipt of payments for settlement receivables and payments we make to customers for our settlement liabilities. To the extent our gaming customers continue to recover, we expect our results of operations and financial condition to continue to improve in 2021.
To date, we have not experienced significant impacts on our supply chain as a result of the pandemic; however, given the dynamic nature of the global situation, this could change.
Liquidity
As of December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $251.7 million, a decrease of $38.2 million from $289.9 million at December 31, 2019; and our Net Cash Position, a non-GAAP measure (as discussed and defined in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” section below), was approximately $139.1 million, an increase of $13 million from $126.1 million at December 31, 2019.
We implemented measures at the onset of the pandemic to prepare us to withstand what could have been a prolonged period of industry inactivity, though industry, conditions improved after casino properties reopened in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020. Our revenues, cash flows, and liquidity improved more during the third and fourth quarter of 2020 compared with the second quarter of 2020 on a sequential basis. Given the significant number of casino properties that have reopened through September 2020, our customers implemented protocols intended to protect their patrons and guests from potential COVID-19 exposure and re-establish customer confidence in the gaming and hospitality industry. These measures, which may include enhanced sanitization, public gathering limitations of casino capacity, patron social distancing requirements, limitations on casino operations, face mask and temperature check requirements, as well as the closure of certain common attractions such as restaurants, bars and other food and beverage outlets, table games, spas, and pools, have limited the number of patrons that are able or who desire to attend these venues and have impacted the pace at which demand for our products and services rebounds.
We expect that demand for our products and services will continue to be tempered to the extent gaming activity decreases or fails to increase at expected rates and to the extent our customers determine to restrict their capital spending as a result of uncertainty in the industry or otherwise. As a result, we expect revenues to remain below pre-COVID levels in the near term and we will continue to monitor and manage liquidity levels and we may, from time to time, evaluate available capital resource alternatives on acceptable terms to provide additional financial flexibility.
Government Relief
In late March 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have taken advantage of the following components contained within the CARES Act:
•Employee Retention Payroll Tax Credit: We are applying a credit against payroll taxes for 50% of eligible employee wages paid or incurred from March 13, 2020 to December 31, 2020. This employee retention payroll tax credit would be provided for as much as $10,000 of qualifying wages for each eligible employee, including health benefits;
•Employer Social Security Tax Payment Deferral: We are deferring payment of the employer portion of the social security taxes due on remaining payments and from enactment of the CARES Act through December 31, 2020, with 50% due by December 31, 2021 and 50% due by December 31, 2022; and
•Alternative Minimum Tax (“AMT”) Credit Refund: We applied for and received a refund of our AMT tax credits as the CARES Act afforded us the ability to accelerate the recovery of such credits.
Additional Items Impacting Comparability of Results of Operations
Our Financial Statements included in this report reflect the following transactions and events, exclusive of the impact of COVID-19:
•During the first quarter of 2020, we completed a partial redemption payment of approximately $84.5 million of aggregate principal with respect to the 7.50% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2025 previously issued in December 2017 (the “2017 Unsecured Notes”) and an open market repurchase of approximately $5.1 million of aggregate principal with respect to the 2017 Unsecured Notes. The total outstanding balance of the 2017 Unsecured Notes following the redemption and repurchase transactions was approximately $285.4 million. We incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $7.5 million, which consisted of a $6.4 million redemption premium related to the satisfaction and redemption of a portion of the 2017 Unsecured Notes, and non-cash charges for the accelerated amortization of the related debt issuance costs of approximately $1.1 million.
•During 2019, we acquired certain assets of Atrient, Inc. (“Atrient”), a privately held company that developed and distributed hardware and software applications to gaming operators to enhance gaming patron loyalty, and Micro Gaming Technologies, Inc. (“MGT”), a privately held company that developed and distributed kiosks and software applications to gaming patrons to enhance patron loyalty, and made cash payments of $20.0 million and $15.0 million at the closing of each transaction, respectively. The acquisitions impacted our results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
As a result of these events, together with the impacts of COVID-19, our results of operations and earnings per share in the periods covered by our Financial Statements may not be directly comparable.
Trends and Developments Impacting our Business
Our strategic planning and forecasting processes include the consideration of economic and industry wide trends that may impact our Games and FinTech businesses. Below we have identified a number of trends that could have a material impact on our business:
•Casino gaming is dependent upon discretionary consumer spending, which is typically the first type of spending that is restrained by consumers when they are uncertain about their jobs and income. Global economic uncertainty in the marketplace may have an impact on casino gaming, gaming establishment capital budgets, and ultimately the demand for new gaming equipment, which impacts both of our segments.
•The total North American installed slot base was slightly lower at the end of 2020 than for 2019, due to reduced capital spending and equipment removals by casino operators due to the impact of COVID-19 restrictions and casino closures. The total base had previously increased in both 2019 and 2018. We expect flat to moderate growth in the forward replacement cycle for slot machines in 2021 and in the total installed base compared to 2020, which could have a positive impact on our Games segment while new machine demand associated with new casino openings and major expansions is likely to be relatively flat year-over-year in 2021.
•We face continued competition from smaller competitors in the gaming cash access market, as well as from larger gaming equipment manufacturers and systems providers. This competition continues to contribute to ongoing pricing pressure for both our Games and FinTech businesses.
•Concerns related to COVID-19 have increased interest in cashless alternatives by casino operators and casino patrons. With the introduction of our cashless, touchless CashClub Wallet solution, this could have a positive impact on our FinTech segment, but could also result in added competition from new competitors.
•Transaction processing and related fees have increased in recent years. We expect the financial services and payments industry to respond to these changes, including in ways that may negatively impact our FinTech business in the future.
•Governmental and regulatory oversight on cash transactions, financial services, and payments processing may provide continued motivation for gaming establishments to consider additional products and services that facilitate regulatory compliance and operational efficiencies.
•We derive a significant portion of our revenue from Native American tribal customers, and our ability to effectively operate in Native American gaming markets is vulnerable to legal and regulatory uncertainties, including the ability to enforce contractual rights on Native American land.
•Casino operators continue to broaden their appeal by focusing on investments in non-gaming amenities for their facilities, which could impact casino operator’s capital allocations for games and payment solution products and services that impact both of our operating segments.
Operating Segments
We report our financial performance within two operating segments: (i) Games; and (ii) FinTech. For additional information on our segments see “Item 1. Business” and “Part II - Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 18 - Segment Information” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Results of Operations
Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019
The following table presents our Results of Operations as reported for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 (amounts in thousands)*:
* Rounding may cause variances.
(1) Exclusive of depreciation and amortization.
* Rounding may cause variances.
Total Revenues
Total revenues decreased by approximately $149.6 million, or 28%, to approximately $383.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the prior year period. This was primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and the closure of many casino properties for a portion of the period. Games revenues decreased by approximately $82.8 million, or 29%, to approximately $200.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the prior year period. We had: (i) a decline in the sale of gaming machines included in our gaming equipment and systems revenues; and (ii) a decrease in the average daily win per unit as a result of units being deactivated for a prolonged period of time on a higher installed base of leased games largely reflecting greater demand for our premium units included in our gaming operations revenues. FinTech revenues decreased by approximately $66.7 million, or 27%, to approximately $183.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the prior year period. We had: (i) a decline in the dollar and transaction volumes included in our cash access services revenues; and (ii) a decrease in the sale of full service kiosks, partially offset by an increase in our loyalty kiosks included in our equipment revenues.
Costs and Expenses
Total costs and expenses decreased by approximately $50.1 million, or 11%, to approximately $389.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in the prior year. This was primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and the closure of many casino properties for a portion of the period. Games cost of revenues decreased by approximately $30.6 million, or 43%, to approximately $41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the prior year period. We had a reduction in the variable costs included in our gaming and equipment systems cost of revenues as a result of the decline in the sale of machines. FinTech cost of revenues decreased by approximately $16.0 million, or 39%, to approximately $24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the prior year period. We had a reduction in the variable costs primarily as a result of : (i) a decline in the dollar and transaction volumes included in our cash access services cost of revenues; and (ii) a decrease in the sale of full-service kiosks, partially offset by an increase in our loyalty kiosks included in our equipment revenues.
Operating expenses decreased by approximately $9.6 million, or 6%, to approximately $152.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the prior year period. This was primarily due to lower payroll and related expenses and trade show-related costs from actions taken in response to COVID-19 for both our Games and FinTech operating segments. In addition, our legal expenses were lower as a result of the litigation costs we incurred in the prior year period in connection with our FACTA matter related to our FinTech operating segment.
Research and development decreased by approximately $4.6 million, or 14%, to approximately $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the prior year period. This was primarily due to lower payroll and related costs included in our Games segment in light of actions taken in response to COVID-19, partially offset by higher payroll and related costs included in our FinTech segment primarily as a result of the acquisition of certain assets in connection with our loyalty solutions in the prior year as costs for research and development consist primarily of salaries and benefits, consulting fees, certification and testing costs.
Depreciation increased by approximately $4.3 million, or 7%, to approximately $67.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the prior year period. This was primarily due to an increase in the installed base of lease gaming machines placed in service included in our Games segment.
Amortization increased by approximately $6.4 million, or 9%, to approximately $75.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to the release of new game themes included in our Games segment and the intangible assets acquired in the prior year period in connection with the loyalty business included in our FinTech segment.
Primarily as a result of the factors and responsive actions taken, described above, in light of COVID-19 and the closure of many casino properties for a portion of the period, operating income decreased by approximately $99.4 million, or 106%, and resulted in an operating loss of approximately $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the prior year. The operating loss margin was 1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to an operating income margin of 18% for the same period in the prior year.
Interest expense, net of interest income, decreased by approximately $3.3 million, or 4%, to approximately $74.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the prior year period. This was primarily due to lower debt balances with respect to certain of our instruments and more favorable variable interest rates in effect for certain of our debt instruments; partially offset by: (i) the amortization of debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the Fourth Amendment to the existing Credit Agreement and entering into the Incremental Term Loan Credit Agreement; (ii) the additional Incremental Term Loan debt incurred with less favorable variable interest rates in effect; (iii) an adjustment to, and the associated accretion of, interest related to the acquisition of certain assets from Atrient and MGT in the prior year; and (iv) a reduction in interest income earned.
Loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was a result of the redemption and repurchase transactions related to the 2017 Unsecured Notes.
Income tax benefit increased by $5.2 million, or 1001%, to approximately $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in the prior year period. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflected an effective income tax rate of 6.6%, which was less than the statutory federal rate of 21.0%, primarily due to an increase in our valuation allowance as a result of the book loss incurred during the period, partially offset by certain indefinite lived deferred tax assets that may be offset against our indefinite lived deferred tax liabilities. The income tax benefit reflected an effective income tax rate of negative 3.3% for the same period in the prior year, which was less than the statutory federal rate of 21.0%, primarily due to a partial decrease in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and a research credit.
Primarily as a result of the factors and responsive actions taken, described above, in light of COVID-19, our net income decreased by approximately $98.2 million, or 595%, as compared to the prior year, and resulted in a net loss of approximately $81.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018:
The following table presents our Results of Operations as reported for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 (amounts in thousands)*:
* Rounding may cause variances.
(1) Exclusive of depreciation and amortization.
* Rounding may cause variances.
Total Revenues
Total revenues increased by approximately $63.7 million, or 14%, to approximately $533.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year period. Games revenues increased by approximately $24.1 million, or 9%, to approximately $283.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year period. This was primarily due to an increase in revenue from gaming operations resulting from both a higher average daily win per unit and an increase in the installed base of leased gaming machines, as well as an increase in equipment revenues due to higher gaming machine unit sales and an increase in our digital (formerly called interactive) revenues. FinTech revenues increased by approximately $39.6 million, or 19%, to approximately $250.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year period. This was primarily due to an increase in equipment revenues resulting from higher sales of our equipment and information services and other solutions, which included, among other sources, revenues of approximately $16.2 million from our loyalty operations acquired during the year, as well as additional cash access services revenues associated with higher dollar and transaction volumes.
Costs and Expenses
Total costs and expenses increased by approximately $55.5 million, or 14%, to approximately $439.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in the prior year. This was primarily due to higher Games and FinTech costs and expenses. Cost of revenues from our Games segment increased by approximately $3.9 million, or 6%, to approximately $71.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year period. This was primarily due to higher variable costs directly related to the increased sales of gaming equipment. Cost of revenues from our FinTech segment increased by approximately $14.1 million, or 53%, to approximately $40.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year period. This was primarily due to the variable costs associated with the higher sales of our equipment and information services solutions, inclusive of the addition of the loyalty business acquired during the year.
Operating expenses increased by approximately $19.9 million, or 14%, to approximately $162.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year period. Our Games segment operating expenses increased primarily due to higher payroll and related expenses, advertising costs related to our digital operations, and additional trade show-related expenses. Our FinTech segment operating expenses increased primarily associated with the loss contingency recorded in connection with the FACTA-related matter and related legal fees, the loyalty operations acquired during the year, and higher payroll and related expenses.
Research and development increased by approximately $12.0 million, or 59%, to approximately $32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year period. This was primarily due to higher payroll and related expenses incurred by our FinTech and Games segments.
Depreciation increased by approximately $2.0 million, or 3%, to approximately $63.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year period, which was relatively consistent with the prior year.
Amortization increased by approximately $3.7 million, or 6%, to approximately $68.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in connection with the loyalty business for our FinTech segment.
Primarily as a result of the increase in revenue partially offset by the increased costs and expenses described above, operating income increased by approximately $8.2 million, or 10%, to approximately $94.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year. The operating income margin was consistent at 18% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
Interest expense, net of interest income, decreased by approximately $5.2 million, or 6%, to approximately $77.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year period. This was primarily due to higher interest income earned during the current reporting period and our lower debt balances.
Loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 in connection with the repricing of the Term Loan Facility completed in December 2019 was comparable to approximately $0.2 million recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the Term Loan Facility repricing completed in May 2018.
Income tax benefit was approximately $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to an income tax benefit of approximately $9.7 million in the prior year period. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflected an effective income tax rate of negative 3.3%, which was less than the statutory federal rate of 21.0% primarily due to a partial decrease in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and a research credit. The tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflected an effective income tax rate of negative 367.0% which was less than the statutory federal rate of 21.0%, primarily due to a partial decrease in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and a research credit. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the partial decrease in our valuation allowance was primarily due to the book income as well as net operating losses for tax purposes, and the interest deduction limitation (deferred tax assets), which can be offset against our indefinite lived deferred tax liabilities.
Primarily as a result of the foregoing, our net income increased by approximately $4.2 million, or 34%, to a net income of approximately $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year period.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our Financial Statements. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of the financial position and results of operations, and which require management to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified our critical accounting policies as those addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies that involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions. Refer to “Part II - Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of these policies. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, based upon information presently available; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Goodwill. We had approximately $682.0 million of goodwill, of which approximately $449.0 million was generated by our Games reporting unit, on our Balance Sheets at December 31, 2020 resulting from acquisitions of other businesses. We test for impairment annually on a reporting unit basis, at the beginning of our fourth fiscal quarter, or more often under certain circumstances. Our reporting units are identified as operating segments or one level below and we evaluate our reporting units at least annually. Refer to “Part II - Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 10 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion.
The annual evaluation of goodwill requires the use of different assumptions, estimates, or judgments in the goodwill impairment testing process, such as: the methodology, the estimated future cash flows of our reporting units, the discount rate used to present value such cash flows, and the market multiples of comparable companies. Management performs its annual forecasting process, which, among other factors, includes reviewing recent historical results, company-specific variables, and industry trends. This process is generally fluid throughout each year and considered in conjunction with the annual goodwill impairment evaluation. Changes in forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates, which could materially affect our results of operations. Our estimates of fair value require significant judgment and are based on assumptions we determined to be reasonable; however, they are unpredictable and inherently uncertain, including: estimates of future growth rates, operating margins, results of operations and financial condition, and assumptions about the overall economic climate as well as the competitive environment for our reporting units.
There can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our goodwill testing as of the time of testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions regarding business plans, competitive environments, anticipated growth rates, or expectations of results of operations and financial condition are not correct, we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods, whether in connection with our next annual impairment testing process, or earlier, in the event an indicator of impairment is present at such time during the year.
Long-Lived Assets. We review the carrying amount of long-lived assets or asset groups whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If triggering events are identified, we compare the carrying amount of the asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, on an undiscounted basis and without interest or taxes. Any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Refer to “Part II - Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 9 - Property, Equipment and Leased Assets ” and “Part II - Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 10 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion.
Recent Accounting Guidance
For a description of our recently adopted accounting guidance and recent accounting guidance not yet adopted, see “Part II - Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Guidance” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
The following table presents selected information about our financial position (in thousands):
(1)Non-GAAP measure. In order to enhance investor understanding of our cash balance, we are providing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Net Cash Position and Net Cash Available, which are not measures of our financial performance or position with GAAP. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for GAAP measures, and should be read in conjunction with our balance sheets prepared in accordance with GAAP. We define our (i) Net Cash Position as cash and cash equivalents plus settlement receivables less settlement liabilities and (ii) Net Cash Available as Net Cash Position plus undrawn amounts available under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our Net Cash Position and Net Cash Available change substantially based upon the timing of our receipt of funds for settlement receivables and payments we make to customers for our settlement liabilities. We present these non-GAAP measures as we monitor these amounts in connection with forecasting of cash flows and future cash requirements, both on a short-term and long-term basis.
Issuance of Common Stock
In December 2019, we filed with the SEC an automatic shelf registration statement for an undetermined amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, and/or units that the Company may offer and sell in one or more offerings on terms to be decided at the time of sale, which will expire on December 4, 2022.
In December 2019, we then issued and sold 11,500,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to a prospectus supplement under the automatic shelf registration statement, for which the aggregate net proceeds of approximately $122.4 million were utilized to pay down and reprice a portion of our existing indebtedness.
Cash Resources
Our cash balance, cash flows and line of credit are expected to be sufficient to meet our recurring operating commitments and to fund our planned capital expenditures on both, a short- and long-term basis. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020 included cash in non-U.S. jurisdictions of approximately $11.5 million. Generally, these funds are available for operating and investment purposes within the jurisdiction in which they reside, and we may from time to time consider repatriating these foreign funds to the United States, subject to potential withholding tax obligations, based on operating requirements.
We expect that cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient for our operating and debt servicing needs during the foreseeable future on both a short- and long-term basis. In addition, we have sufficient borrowings available under our senior secured revolving credit facility to meet further funding requirements. We monitor the financial strength of our lenders on an ongoing basis using publicly available information. Based upon available information, we believe our lenders should be able to honor their commitments under the Credit Agreement (defined in “Note 12 - Long-term Debt”).
Cash Flows
The following table presents a summary of our cash flow activity for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):
Cash flows provided by operating activities were approximately $36.2 million, $84.9 million, and $294.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased by approximately $48.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the prior year period, primarily attributable to the impact of COVID-19 on our Games and FinTech segments, as well as changes in working capital and non-cash adjustments from our Games and FinTech segment. Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased by approximately $209.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year period. This was primarily attributable to the changes in working capital associated with settlement receivables and settlement liabilities from our FinTech segment.
Cash flows used in investing activities were approximately $94.1 million, $166.3 million, and $123.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Cash flows used in investing activities decreased by approximately $72.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the prior year period, primarily attributable to our response to the impact of COVID-19, for which we reduced our capital expenditures in both our Games and FinTech segments, and the impact of the acquisition of certain loyalty related assets in our FinTech segment in the prior year. Cash flows used in investing activities increased by approximately $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year period. This was primarily attributable to the acquisition of certain loyalty related assets for our FinTech segment and an increase in capital expenditures.
Cash flows provided by financing activities were approximately $15.1 million, $77.6 million, and $11.0 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 respectively. Cash flows provided by financing activities decreased by approximately $62.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the prior year period. This was primarily attributable to the repayments of borrowings under our 2017 Unsecured Notes and Senior Secured Credit Facilities during the period and the secondary equity offering in the prior year period, partially offset by the proceeds from the Incremental Term Loan. Cash flows provided by financing activities increased by approximately $77.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior period, primarily due to issuance and sale of our common stock under the automatic shelf registration statement and proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by repayments of our credit facility completed in 2019.
Capital Expenditures
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash spent for capital expenditures totaled $76.4 million, of which $62.6 million and $13.8 million was related to our Games and FinTech segments, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash spent for capital expenditures totaled $114.3 million, of which $96.0 million and $18.3 million, was related to our Games and FinTech segments, respectively.
Long-Term Debt
At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $735.5 million of borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. We had $35.0 million of additional borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $124.4 million of borrowings outstanding under the Incremental Term Loan Facility and we had approximately $285.4 million outstanding under our 2017 Unsecured Notes.
