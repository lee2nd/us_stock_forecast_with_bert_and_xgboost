The rental expense was $30,893 and $36,157 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

In the next twelve (12) months, the Company will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support, new technology solutions, and enhancement of existing technology to serve our customers. We expect capital expenditures to increase to up to $100,000 in the next twelve (12) months to support the growth, which mainly includes software development and purchase of computers and servers. Also, the Company estimates additional expenditure needed to be $200,000, which provides for $50,000 and $150,000 for sales and marketing and working capital, respectively.
We expect that the combination of existing cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and access to private equity and capital markets to be sufficient for at least the next twelve (12) months. The availability of funds will fund our operating activities, meet the need for investing and financing activities, such as debt maturities and material capital expenditures. However, we may need additional funds to achieve a sustainable sales level to fund our ongoing operations out of revenues. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or, if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us.
Should we require additional capital, the Company’s operations are not sufficient to fund its capital requirements. The Company may attempt to enter the restructuring of Notes, or refinance existing Notes with financial institutions or attempt to raise capital by selling additional capital stock or debt issuance. The Company intends to continue its efforts in growing its operations and raising funds through private equity and debt financing.

GOING CONCERN CONSIDERATION
We have not generated significant revenues since inception to December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $1,493,984 and $1,035,494, respectively. Our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their report on the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, and the period from January 21, 2016 (inception) to December 31, 2016, regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent auditors. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset carrying amounts or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
We have based our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and operations results on our financial statements, which we have prepared following the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing our financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Our actual results could differ from these estimates, and such differences could be material.
In more detail, we have described significant accounting policies in Note 2 of our annual financial statements included in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on March 3, 2021. We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as appropriate based on changing conditions.
JOBS Act Accounting Election
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards after enacting the JOBS Act until those standards apply to private companies. As an emerging growth company, we have applied for exemption; thus, the Company may delay adopting certain accounting standards until the standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations
We have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(c) of the SEC’s Regulation S-B. We did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The ASU amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods therein. Early adoption of the standard is permitted, including adoption in interim or annual periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. We have adopted ASC 606 - Revenue Recognition from January 1, 2019, and Amended ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 840) from January 1, 2020. The ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We believe the accounting policies described in Note 2 are critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. As a result, we have described significant accounting policies in more detail in Note 2 of our annual financial statements included in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 3, 2021.
