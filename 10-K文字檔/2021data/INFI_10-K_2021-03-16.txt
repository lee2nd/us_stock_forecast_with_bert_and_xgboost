Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis and set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the section titled “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
We are an innovative biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing novel medicines for people with cancer. We combine proven scientific expertise with a passion for developing novel small molecule drugs that target disease pathways for potential applications in oncology. We are focusing on advancing, eganelisib, also known as IPI-549, an orally administered, clinical-stage, immuno-oncology product candidate that selectively inhibits the enzyme phosphoinositide-3-kinase-gamma, or PI3K-gamma. We believe eganelisib is the only selective inhibitor of PI3K-gamma being investigated in clinical trials. We have worldwide development and commercialization rights to eganelisib, subject to certain success-based milestone payment obligations to our licensor, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, as described in more detail under Part I, Item 1, “Business Overview - Alliances, Collaborations, and Other Arrangements - Takeda.”
MARIO-275 (MAcrophage Reprogramming in Immuno-Oncology-275)
MARIO-275 is our global, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study evaluating the effect of adding eganelisib to nivolumab, also known as Opdivo®, in checkpoint-naïve advanced urothelial cancer, or UC, patients whose cancer has progressed or recurred following treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. Nivolumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy commercialized by Bristol Myers Squibb Company, or BMS. Further details regarding the study are provided under the section entitled Part I, Item 1, “Business Overview - Eganelisib Clinical Development Program - MARIO-275 (MAcrophage Reprogramming in Immuno-Oncology).” The following are the key developments related to MARIO-275:
•In May 2020, we voluntarily paused enrollment in the study following a planned review by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or IDMC, where liver enzyme elevations of Grade 3 or higher were seen in seven of 42 patients. We implemented a dose reduction of eganelisib from 40 mg daily, or QD, to 30 mg QD and have observed a reduction in liver enzyme elevations.
•In September 2020, the IDMC indicated that the risk/benefit to patients supported resumption of enrollment and continued evaluation of eganelisib plus nivolumab in second line urothelial cancer following cisplatin treatment.
•On February 11, 2021, we presented data at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers Symposium, or ASCO GU, from MARIO-275.
◦The greatest benefit of the combination of eganelisib and nivolumab was observed in the PD-L1 low patient population (n=23), with improvement over nivolumab monotherapy (n=7) in overall response rate (ORR) (26% vs. 14%); disease control rate (DCR) (57% vs. 14%); and best responses of complete response (CR) (9% vs. 0%), and stable disease (SD) (30% vs. 0%).
◦The combination of eganelisib and nivolumab was well tolerated at a 30 mg once daily, or QD, dose, which was reduced from the initial dose of 40 mg QD to address liver enzyme elevations reported at the IDMC. The median average daily dose of eganelisib in the study was 31.5 mg. The most common TEAEs were pyrexia (33%), decreased appetite (33%), pruritus (24%), rash (24%), and increased alanine aminotransferase (24%). The most common ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs across all doses, all causality, were disease progression (24.2%), hepatotoxicity (24.2%), increased ALT (12.1%), and increased AST (12.1%). No Hy’s law cases were observed and no Grade 5 TEAEs were reported.
•Based on the data from MARIO-275, we are planning a new registration-enabling study and will not re-open enrollment in MARIO-275.
MARIO-3
MARIO-3 is a multi-arm Phase 2 study designed to evaluate eganelisib in the front-line setting for triple negative breast cancer, or TNBC, and front-line renal cell carcinoma, or RCC. The TNBC cohort is evaluating eganelisib in combination with atezolizumab, also known as Tecentriq®, and nab-paclitaxel, also known as Abraxane®, in up to 60 patients with front-line TNBC. The RCC cohort is evaluating eganelisib in combination with atezolizumab and bevacizumab, also known as Avastin®, in up to 30 patients with front-line RCC. We entered into a clinical supply agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., or Roche, in March 2019 under which Roche has agreed to supply atezolizumab and bevacizumab for our use in MARIO-3.
•On December 9, 2020, we presented data at the 2020 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, or SABCS, from the TNBC cohort of MARIO-3. As of the November 6, 2020 cut-off date for SABCS, we had enrolled 20 of 60 patients, and the seven most recently enrolled patients remained on treatment but had not yet had their first assessment. The poster presented the following findings:
◦100% of evaluable patients (n=13) demonstrated tumor reduction with a clinical benefit (disease control rate) in 92% of patients (12/13);
◦69.2% (9/13) ORR, with best responses of CR or PR;
◦100% (5/5) ORR (CR + PR), with one CR and four PRs observed in PD-L1 high patients;
◦50% (4/8) ORR (CR + PR), with four PRs observed in PD-L1 low patients; and
◦Safety data showed that the triple combination treatment with eganelisib, atezolizumab, and nab-paclitaxel demonstrated safety in line with expectations of the component drugs with no additive or new safety signals. The most common ≥ Grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events were decreased neutrophil count (21.4 percent), diarrhea (14.3 percent), and rash (14.3 percent). Only one patient (7.1 percent) experienced ≥ Grade 3 ALT/AST increase, and this patient had a Grade 3 elevation.
•We expect to complete enrollment for the MARIO-3 TNBC cohort in the second half of 2021 and expect to present data regarding PFS and updated ORR data for the TNBC cohort in the first and the second half of 2021.
•Enrollment is complete in the RCC cohort and we expect to present data from the RCC cohort in the first half of 2022.
MARIO-1
Enrollment is complete in MARIO-1, our Phase 1/1b clinical study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and activity for eganelisib - both as a monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab - in 224 patients with advanced solid tumors. The study included a dose escalation portion and a combination therapy expansion portion evaluating patients dosed at 40 mg QD of eganelisib in combination with the standard regimen of nivolumab in the following forms of cancer: non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, or SCCHN, TNBC, mesothelioma, adrenocortical carcinoma, and those with high baseline blood levels of MDSCs. We provided updated data for the melanoma expansion cohort and SCCHN expansion cohort at the 2021 Annual Meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancers. Data from both cohorts shows evidence of clinical activity in patients not expected to benefit from checkpoint inhibitor, or CPI, monotherapy due to immediate prior progression on a CPI. Safety data from both cohorts indicates the combination therapy was generally well tolerated and associated with a favorable safety profile.
Arcus Collaboration Trial
In December 2020, Arcus Biosciences, Inc., or Arcus, presented data at SABCS from the Phase 1/1b clinical study collaboration between Infinity and Arcus on ARC-2, a study designed to evaluate each company’s respective drug candidates in up to 40 patients with previously treated, advanced TNBC and ovarian cancer. The ARC-2 SABCS data showed that a novel triple-combination regimen of eganelisib in combination with etrumadenant, Arcus’s dual adenosine receptor antagonist, and liposomal doxorubicin chemotherapy, also known as Doxil®, lead to a meaningful increase in response in TNBC patients. The companies have determined that these findings are sufficient to guide their internal development plans and have decided to close enrollment while allowing existing patients to remain on treatment.
Etrumadenant is an orally bioavailable, highly potent antagonist of the adenosine 2a and 2b receptors. The activation of these receptors by adenosine interferes with the activity of key populations of immune cells and inhibits the body’s optimal anti-tumor immune response. By blocking these receptors, etrumadenant has the potential to reverse adenosine-induced immune suppression within the tumor microenvironment. As both macrophages and high adenosine levels are believed to play critical roles in creating a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in cancer after treatment with chemotherapy, the novel immuno-oncology combination being evaluated in this setting represents a potentially promising approach to treating TNBC and ovarian cancer.
Recent Events
On February 11, 2021, we entered into a purchase agreement with Piper Sandler & Co., as representative of the underwriters named therein, pursuant to which we issued and sold to the underwriters in an underwritten public offering an aggregate of 24,150,000 shares of our common stock, including 3,150,000 shares of common stock sold in connection with the exercise in full of a 15% over-allotment option by the underwriters. The public offering price was $3.80 per share. The gross proceeds to us from this offering were approximately $91.8 million. After underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, we received net proceeds from the offering of approximately $86.0 million.
Financial Overview
Revenue
To date, all of our revenue has been generated under collaboration agreements, including payments to us of upfront license fees, funding or reimbursement of research and development efforts, milestone payments if specified objectives are achieved, and royalties on product sales. In the future, we may generate revenue from a combination of product sales, research and development support services and milestone payments in connection with strategic relationships, as well as royalties resulting from the sales of products developed under licenses of our intellectual property. We expect that any potential future revenue we generate will fluctuate from year to year as a result of the timing and amount of license fees, research and development reimbursement, milestone, royalty and other payments earned under our collaborative or strategic relationships and the amount and timing of payments that we earn upon the sale of our products, to the extent any are successfully commercialized.
Research and Development Expense
We are a drug development company. Our research and development expense has historically consisted primarily of the following:
•compensation of personnel associated with research and development activities;
•clinical testing costs, including payments made to contract research organizations;
•costs of combination and comparator drugs used in clinical studies;
•costs of manufacturing product candidates for preclinical testing and clinical studies;
•costs associated with the licensing of research and development programs;
•preclinical testing costs, including costs of toxicology studies;
•fees paid to external consultants;
•fees paid to professional service providers for independent monitoring and analysis of our clinical trials;
•costs for collaboration partners to perform research and development activities, including development milestones for which a payment is due when achieved;
•depreciation of equipment; and
•allocated costs of facilities.
General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative expense primarily consists of compensation of personnel in executive, finance, accounting, legal and intellectual property, information technology, corporate communications, and human resources functions. Other costs include facilities costs not otherwise included in research and development expense and professional fees for legal and accounting services.
Royalty Expense
Royalty expense is recorded when incurred and represents the expense associated with amounts owed to third parties as a result of royalty revenue recognized and the amounts owed by us to Takeda in relation to sale of future royalties.
Other Income and Expense
Other income and expense typically consist of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities, non-cash interest expense, and changes in fair value of warrant liability.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to cumulative revenue related to variable consideration, accrued expenses, estimates of future net royalty payments used in the calculation of our liability related to the sale of future royalties, and assumptions in the valuation of stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Differences between actual and estimated results have not been material and have been adjusted in the period they become known. We believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Please refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of our significant accounting policies.
Revenue Recognition
To date, all our revenue has been generated under collaboration agreements, including payments to us of upfront license fees, funding or reimbursement of research and development efforts, milestone payments if specified objectives are achieved, and/or royalties on product sales.
We recognize revenue when we transfers goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive for those goods or services. These principles are applied using a five-step model: 1) identify the customer contract; 2) identify the contract’s performance obligations; 3) determine the transaction price; 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and 5) recognize revenue when or as a performance obligation is satisfied. We evaluate all promised goods and services within a customer contract and determine which of those are separate performance obligations. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether the good or service is capable of being distinct and whether the good or service is separable from other promises in the contract. When a performance obligation is satisfied, we recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price, excluding estimates of variable consideration that are constrained, that is allocated to that performance obligation. For contracts that contain variable consideration, such as milestone payments, we estimate the amount of variable consideration by using either the expected value method or the most likely amount method. In making this assessment, we evaluate factors such as the clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the milestone. Each reporting period we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such milestones and any related constraints. We will include variable consideration, without constraint, in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.
We recognize sales-based milestones and royalty revenue based upon net sales by the licensee of licensed products in licensed territories, and in the period the sales occur under the sales- and usage-based royalty exception when the sole or predominate item to which the royalty relates is a license to intellectual property.
In the event of an early termination of a collaboration agreement, any contract liabilities would be recognized in the period in which all our obligations under the agreement have been fulfilled.
Accrued Expenses
As part of the process of preparing financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued expenses. This process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date. Examples of services for which we must estimate accrued expenses include contract service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with pharmaceutical development work and to contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials and preclinical studies. In connection with these service fees, our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed. In the event that we do not identify certain costs that have been incurred by our service providers, or if we under- or over-estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services in any given period, our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high, respectively. We often rely on subjective judgments to determine the date on which certain services commence, the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services. We make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us. Our estimates of expenses in future periods may be under- or over-accrued.
Liabilities Related to Sale of Future Royalties
We treat the liabilities related to sale of future royalties as debt financings, amortized under the effective interest rate method over the estimated life of the related royalty streams. The liabilities related to sale of future royalties and the debt amortization are based on our current estimates of future royalties expected to be paid over the life of the arrangements. We will periodically assess the expected royalty payments using projections from external sources. To the extent our estimates of future royalty payments are greater or less than previous estimates or the estimated timing of such payments is materially different than previous estimates, we will adjust the effective interest rate and recognize related non-cash interest expense on a prospective basis. Non-cash royalty revenue is reflected as royalty revenue, and non-cash amortization of debt is reflected as interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Results of Operations
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, in thousands, together with the change in each item as a percentage.
Revenue
We did not recognize any collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of $2.0 million of revenue related to the milestone payment for PellePharm’s initiation of a Phase 3 study investigating IPI-926, or patidegib, in patients with Gorlin Syndrome, a rare genetic disease that leads to the chronic formation of multiple basal cell carcinomas, as this milestone payment is variable consideration that became unconstrained following initiation of the study.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized approximately $1.7 million in royalty revenue, an increase of 64% as compared to approximately $1.0 million in royalty revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is related to royalties on net sales of duvelisib from Verastem and Secura Bio. A portion of the royalties received is owed to Mundipharma and Purdue. We refer to such portion as the Trailing Mundipharma Royalties (see Note 12 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). We and HCR, entered into a purchase and sale agreement in March 2019, or the HCR Agreement, pursuant to which HCR acquired our interest in royalties received from Verastem and Secura Bio on net sales of duvelisib, less the Trailing Mundipharma Royalties (see Note 9 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
Research and Development Expense
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized approximately $26.8 million in research and development expense, a decrease of approximately 1% as compared to approximately $27.1 million in research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2019. Research and development expenses represented approximately 67% and 56% of our total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
We began to track and accumulate costs by major program starting on January 1, 2006. These expenses primarily relate to payroll and related expenses for personnel working on the programs, process development and manufacturing, preclinical toxicology studies, clinical trial costs and allocated costs of facilities. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2020, we estimate that we incurred $26.8 million, $27.1 million and $683.4 million, respectively, on our PI3K inhibitor program, including eganelisib and duvelisib.
We expect our research and development expense to increase as a result of our continued clinical development of eganelisib. We do not believe that the historical costs associated with our lead drug development programs are indicative of the future costs associated with these programs, nor represent what any other future drug development programs we initiate may cost. Due to the variability in the length of time and scope of activities necessary to develop a product candidate and uncertainties related to our cost estimates and our ability to obtain marketing approval for eganelisib or any future product candidates we may develop, accurate and meaningful estimates of the total costs required to bring product candidates to market are not available.
Because of the risks inherent in drug development, we cannot reasonably estimate or know:
•the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our programs;
•the completion dates of these programs; or
•the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence, if at all, from the programs described above and any potential future product candidates.
There is significant uncertainty regarding our ability to successfully develop any product candidates. These risks include the uncertainty of:
•the scope, rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials that we are currently conducting or may commence in the future;
•clinical trial results;
•the cost of establishing clinical supplies of any product candidates;
•the cost and availability of combination and comparator drugs;
•the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights relating to our programs under development;
•the terms and timing of any collaborations, licensing and other arrangements that we have or may establish in the future relating to our programs under development;
•the cost and timing of regulatory approvals; and
•the effect of competing technological and market developments.
General and Administrative Expense
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $12.4 million in general and administrative expense, a decrease of 13% as compared to approximately $14.3 million in general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $0.8 million in compensation, related to a reduction in stock compensation, a decrease of $0.5 million related to professional services, and a decrease of $0.3 million in organizational support.
Royalty Expense
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $1.0 million in royalty expense, a decrease of 86% as compared to approximately $7.3 million in royalty expense for the year ended December 31, 2019. Royalty expense represents the Trailing Mundipharma Royalties and costs owed by us to Takeda, including the $6.7 million paid to Takeda in relation to the HCR Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2019 (see Note 12 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
Investment and Other Income
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $0.5 million in investment and other income, a decrease of 60% as compared to approximately $1.1 million in investment and other income for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decreased was primarily attributable to lower yields on our cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities.
Interest Expense
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $0.2 million in interest expense, a decrease of 94% as compared to approximately $2.6 million in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was due to non-cash interest expense related to the sale of future royalties in relation to the HCR Agreement, which we recognized as a liability that is being amortized using the effective interest method over the life of the arrangement (see Note 9 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
Related Party Interest Expense
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $2.3 million in related party interest expense due to non-cash interest expense related to the sale of future royalties in relation to the BVF Funding Agreement, which we recognized as a liability that is being amortized using the effective interest method over the life of the arrangement (see Note 10 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). We did not recognize any related party interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have primarily incurred operating losses since inception. Our net loss was $40.5 million and $47.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $766.3 million. As we have no approved products, we have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and we do not expect to generate any such revenue for the foreseeable future, if at all. We have instead relied on the proceeds from sales of equity securities, sales of future royalties, debt, interest on investments, up-front license fees, expense reimbursement, milestones, royalties and cost sharing under our collaborations to fund our operations. Our available-for-sale debt securities primarily trade in liquid markets, and the average days to maturity of our portfolio, as of December 31, 2020, is less than six months. Because eganelisib is in an early stage of clinical development and the outcome of our effort is uncertain, we cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of eganelisib or whether, or when, we may achieve profitability.
We expect to continue to spend significant resources to fund the development and potential commercialization of eganelisib, and we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future. We expect to incur substantial operating losses over the next several years as our clinical trial and drug manufacturing activities increase. In addition, in connection with seeking and possibly obtaining regulatory approval of eganelisib or any future product candidates we may develop, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses for product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. As a result, we expect that our accumulated deficit will also increase significantly.
The following table summarizes the components of our financial condition:
Cash Flows
The principal use of cash in operating activities in all periods presented was related to our research and development programs. Our cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the $6.7 million payment to Takeda in relation to the HCR Agreement in 2019 (see Note 12 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
Our cash used in operating activities in future periods may vary significantly due to various factors, including potential cash inflows from future collaboration agreements and potential cash outflows for licensing new programs from third parties. We cannot be certain whether and when we may enter into any such collaboration agreements or license agreements.
Our cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 included purchases and proceeds from maturities of available-for-sale securities and purchases of property and equipment. Our cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 included $43.0 million in purchases of available-for-sale securities and proceeds of $57.7 million from maturities of available-for-sale securities. Our cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 included $41.9 million in purchases of available-for-sale securities and proceeds of $32.0 million from maturities of available-for-sale securities.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 included the proceeds from our sale of future royalties in relation to the BVF Funding Agreement and net proceeds from our common stock sales facility of $7.7 million. Net cash provided by financing for the year ended December 31, 2019 included the proceeds from our sale of future royalties in relation to the HCR Agreement
We will need substantial additional funds to support our planned operations. In the absence of additional funding or business development activities, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities, together with the $86.0 million net proceeds from our February 2021 public offering (as discussed below), will be adequate to satisfy our current operating plans for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. We do not expect to generate significant revenue from product sales unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize one of our current or future product candidates. Until we can generate sufficient levels of cash from operations, and because sufficient funds may not be available to us when needed from collaborations, we expect that we will be required to continue to fund our operations in part through the sale of debt or equity securities or through licensing select programs or partial economic rights that include up-front, royalty and/or milestone payments. Our need to raise additional funds may be accelerated if our research and development expenses exceed our current expectations, if we acquire a third party, or if we acquire or license rights to additional product candidates or new technologies from one or more third parties. Our future funding requirements, both short-term and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:
•the scope, progress, results and costs of developing eganelisib, currently in clinical development;
•the impact of delays in patient enrollment and site activation related to the COVID-19 pandemic;
•the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for eganelisib;
•subject to receipt of marketing approval, revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of eganelisib;
•the timing and amount of additional revenues, if any, received from collaboration agreements and funding arrangements, including:
▪milestone payments from entities affiliated with BVF under the funding agreement we entered into with such parties;
▪regulatory and commercial-based milestone payments from PellePharm, Inc., or PellePharm, under the license agreement we entered into with PellePharm related to the development and commercialization of patidegib, the hedgehog inhibitor we licensed to PellePharm under the PellePharm Agreement; and
▪milestone payments related to commercial sales of products containing duvelisib, or Copiktra®, in oncology indications, or Licensed Products, we might receive under the HCR Agreement, or any additional royalties we might receive from Secura Bio, if such rights reverted to us in accordance with the HCR Agreement upon satisfaction of our obligations to HCR thereunder;
•the timing and amount of additional royalty and milestone payments owed to Takeda, based on sales of Licensed Products by Secura Bio;
•the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation;
•any breach, acceleration event or event of default under any agreements with third parties;
•the outcome of any lawsuits that could be brought against us;
•the cost of acquiring raw materials for, and of manufacturing, eganelisib is higher than anticipated;
•the cost or quantity required of comparator or combination drugs used in clinical studies increases;
•the effect of competing technological and market developments;
•any federal government shutdown that prevents or delays the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, from processing any future registration statements we may file to register shares for capital raising purposes; and
•a loss in our investments due to general market conditions or other reasons.
Historically, we have relied on our collaborations for a significant portion of our research and development funding needs through upfront payments, milestones, royalties, and cost reimbursements.
As of December 31, 2020, we have received $261.9 million of net proceeds from our public stock offerings, including our common stock sales facility. On February 17, 2021, we completed a public offering of 24,150,000 shares of our common stock at an offering price of $3.80 per share, which included 3,150,000 shares sold upon the exercise in full of a 15% over-allotment option by the underwriters. We received $91.8 million in gross proceeds. After underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, we received net proceeds from the offering of approximately $86.0 million.
We may continue to seek additional funding through public or private financings of equity and/or debt securities, but such financings may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our financings may be dilutive to, or otherwise adversely affect, holders of our common stock, and such terms may impact our ability to make capital expenditures or incur additional debt.
We may also seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or other third parties, or through project financing. These arrangements would generally require us to relinquish or encumber rights to some of our technologies or product candidates, and we may not be able to enter into such agreements on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, we may be required to curtail or terminate some or all of our development programs or to scale back, suspend or terminate our business operations.
Common Stock Sales Facility
On June 28, 2019, we entered into a Capital on Demand Sales Agreement with JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC, or JonesTrading, and on July 29, 2019 we amended and restated the sales agreement to add B.
