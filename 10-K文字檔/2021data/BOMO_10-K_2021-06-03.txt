ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those consolidated financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. See “Forward-Looking Statements.”
Compensation Expense
Compensation expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $120,000. This is for the base salary of our Chief Executive, Conrad R. Huss
General and Administrative Expense
General and Administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $166,255 compared to $425,698 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The break-out of General and Administrative expense is as follows;
Line-item analyses follow:
Consulting fees were $189,000 higher during the current period due to a new consulting contract being entered into as of April 1, 2020 at $25,000 per month.
Reconciliation of debt balances was $257,324. Upon reconciling the balances of amounts owed to Oasis Capital, LLC, it was determined that the balance was understated by $257,324. This correction was made in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Financing costs were $100,000 lower in the current period due to a one-time expense in 2019.
Professional Fees
Professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $48,325 compared to $104,930 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Professional fees consist mostly of legal, accounting and audit fees. The decrease was primarily due to reduced legal fees associated with conversions and lower audit expenses.
Other Income (Expense)
Other Income (expense) for the year ended December 31 2020 was ($1,518,380) compared to ($1,196,345) for the year ended December 31, 2019. The break-out of Other Income (Expense) is as follows;
Interest expense was lower by $411,709 in 2020 due to reduced debt levels, the write-off of the third-party debt and lower amortization of debt discount.
The change in fair value of derivatives was $1,857,490 higher due to greater volatility in the market price of the Company’s stock.
Gain on extinguishment of debt and accrued interest was $439,326 greater due to the write-off of old debt and accrued interest. See NOTE 11- WRITE-OFF OF THIRD-PARTY NOTE for more detail
Net Loss
The Company had a net loss of ($2,184,029) for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to ($1,587,530) for the year ended December 31, 2019. Of the loss in 2020, approximately ($665,000) was due to operations and the remainder was due primarily to interest expenses and derivative expenses on convertible debt, partially offset by the gain on write-off of debt and accrued interest.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we used $37,600 in operating activities compared to $117,579 used in the prior year.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated $37,600 through financing activities compared to $116,000 in the year ended December 31, 2019. The reduction in funds was due to reduced, funds from financings as the Company evaluates its operating options.
The Company currently owes $254,400 on notes payable, all of which are in default, and $2,217,163 for outstanding convertible notes. The majority of the notes payable are in default.
Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going-concern basis. The going concern basis assumes that assets are realized, and liabilities are extinguished in the ordinary course of business at amounts disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. The Company has incurred recurring losses from operation and does not currently have revenue generating operations. The Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately $82 million, and a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $2.2 million. Of the loss, approximately $400,000 was due to operations and the remainder was due primarily to interest expense, the write-off of receivables and the loss on the issuance of preferred stock, partially offset by the gain on extinguishment of debt. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern depends upon its ability to obtain adequate funding to support its operations through continuing investments of debt and/or equity by qualified investors/creditors, internally generated working capital and monetization of intellectual property assets. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Management is currently pursuing a business strategy which includes raising the necessary funds to finance the Company’s development and marketing efforts.
There can be no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or available from external sources such as debt or equity financings, or other potential sources. The inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise capital from external sources will force the Company to substantially curtail and cease operations, therefore, having a material adverse effect on its business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any funds, if available, will possess attractive terms or not have a significant dilutive effect on the Company’s existing stockholders.
