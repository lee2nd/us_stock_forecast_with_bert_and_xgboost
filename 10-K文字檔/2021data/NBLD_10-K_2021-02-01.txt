ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION
Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking (within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national and local general economic and market conditions; demographic changes; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; changes in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Although the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects.
Overview
We are engaged in the business of providing digital media and marketing services for the real estate industry. We currently generate revenue from service fees (video creation and production and website hosting (ReachFactor)).... At the core of our programs is our proprietary video creation technology which allows for an automated conversion of data (text, video slices and pictures of home listings) to a video with voice over and music. We provide video search, storage and marketing capabilities on multiple platform dynamics for web and mobile. Once a home, personal or community video is created using our proprietary technology, it can be published to social media, email or distributed to multiple real estate websites. In addition, we own and operate the web site LoseTheAgent.com, which is a site dedicated to peer-to-peer real estate transactions between home sellers and buyers - the so called For Sale By Owner segment. We currently have approximately 100,000 home listings across all 50 states. We monetize the website by charging fees for both listing a home for sale and picking up possible buyers’ messages of interest. We also plan on generating additional revenues by monetizing seller/buyer information with targeted, interested parties. The web site is functional and is being marketed via various online platforms.
Going Concern
As a result of our financial condition, our auditors have indicated in a footnote to our financial statements as of November 30, 2020 their uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern. In order to continue as a going concern, we must effectively balance many factors and begin to generate sufficient revenue to fund our operations. If we are not able to do this, we may not be able to continue as an operating company. At our current revenue and burn rate, our cash on hand will not cover our operating expenses for the next twelve months. There is no assurance that our existing cash flow will ever be adequate to satisfy our existing operating expenses and capital requirements.
Results of Operations for the Year Ended November 30, 2020 compared to Year Ended November 30, 2019
Revenue
Total revenue for the year ended November 30, 2020 was $73,374, compared to $136,863 for the year ended November 30, 2019, a decrease of 46%. The decrease is primarily a result of declining legacy virtual tour business.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenues totaled $39,587 for year ended November 30, 2020, compared to $104,355 for the year ended November 30, 2019, representing a decrease of $64,768 or 62%. Cost of revenues consists primarily of engineering and server costs incurred in connection with maintenance of our online networks. The decline in costs is primarily due to a reduction in server costs.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses, which include salaries and benefits, selling and promotion, amortization and depreciation and general and administrative expenses, decreased 374% to $113,842, for the year ended November 30, 2020, compared to $426,068 for the year ended November 30, 2019, a decrease of $312,226. The decrease was substantially due to a decrease in salary and benefit expense of $203,477, decreases in selling and promotional expense of $87,249 and decrease of general and administrative expenses of $21,500. A breakdown of general and administrative expenses is as follows:
Other Income (Expenses)
During the year, we repurchased our convertible promissory notes for their holders at a discount to the principle and accrued interest owed and recognized a gain on those transactions.
Net Income/Loss
We had net loss of $69,617 for the year ended November 30, 2020, compared to a net loss of $393,560 for the year ended November 30, 2019, for a decrease of $323,943.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Introduction
Our principal needs for liquidity have been to fund operating losses and working capital requirements. Our principal source of liquidity as of November 30, 2020 consisted of cash of $4,124. We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be our principal need for liquidity over the near term. Working capital requirements are expected to increase as a result of our anticipated growth.
We have not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs and allow us to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until we become profitable. If we are unable to obtain adequate capital, we could be forced to cease operations. Management’s plan to meet our operating expenses in the short term is through equity and/or debt financing.
Cash Requirements
At November 30, 2020, we had $4,124 cash on-hand, a decrease of $258,991 from the prior year balance of $263,115. Based on our current revenues, cash on hand, and our current net monthly burn rate of approximately $15,000 we will need to continue to raise money from the issuance of equity to fund short term operations.
Sources and Uses of Cash
Operations
Net cash used by operating activities was $86,571 for the year ended November 30, 2020, a decrease of $121,265 from $207,835 used in operating activities in the year ended November 30, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the net loss from the year.
Investments
There were no investing activities for the years ended November 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Financing
Net cash used by financing activities was $172,420 for the year ended November 30, 2020, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $230,025 for the year ended November 30, 2019.
