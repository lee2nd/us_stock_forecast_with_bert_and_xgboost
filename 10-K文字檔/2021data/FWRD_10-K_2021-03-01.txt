Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview and Executive Summary
We have two reportable segments: Expedited Freight and Intermodal. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we changed our reportable segments to reflect how the chief operating decision maker allocates resources and evaluates performance. We have recast our financial information and disclosures for the prior periods as if the current presentation had been in effect throughout all periods presented.
Through the Expedited Freight segment, we operate a comprehensive national network to provide expedited regional, inter-regional and national LTL services. Expedited Freight offers customers local pick-up and delivery and other services including final mile, truckload, shipment consolidation and deconsolidation, warehousing, customs brokerage and other handling. We plan to grow our LTL and final mile geographic footprints through greenfield start-ups as well as acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Expedited Freight accounted for 84.5% of our consolidated revenue.
Our Intermodal segment provides first- and last-mile high value intermodal container drayage services both to and from seaports and railheads. Intermodal also offers dedicated contract and container freight station (“CFS”) warehouse and handling services. Today, Intermodal operates primarily in the Midwest and Southeast, with smaller operational presence in Southwest and Mid-Atlantic United States. We plan to grow Intermodal’s geographic footprint through acquisitions as well as greenfield start-ups where we do not have an acceptable acquisition target. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Intermodal accounted for 15.7% of our consolidated revenue.
Our operations, particularly our network of hubs and terminals, represent substantial fixed costs. Consequently, our ability to increase our earnings depends in significant part on our ability to increase the amount of freight and the revenue per pound for the freight shipped through our networks and to grow other services, such as LTL pickup and delivery, final mile solutions and intermodal services, which will allow us to maintain revenue growth in challenging shipping environments. In addition, we are continuing to execute synergies across our services, particularly with service offerings in the Expedited Freight segment. Synergistic opportunities include the ability to share resources, particularly our fleet resources.
Trends and Developments
Ransomware Incident
In December 2020, we detected the Ransomware Incident which impacted our operational and information technology systems. The Ransomware Incident caused service delays for many of our customers. Promptly upon detecting the Ransomware Incident, we initiated our response protocols, launched an investigation and engaged the services of cybersecurity and forensic professionals. We also engaged with the appropriate law enforcement authorities.
We contained the incident and recovered from it, resuming normal operations with our customers within several days of the incident. However, operations were adversely affected by the inefficiencies caused by the Ransomware Incident and fourth quarter 2020 revenue was also adversely affected as we were unable to fulfill a portion of customer demand during the quarter.
In addition, we incurred $1.6 million of expense in the fourth quarter of 2020 associated with the Ransomware Incident consisting primarily of payments to third-party service providers and consultants, including investigation and legal fees, all of which were expensed as incurred.
We expect to incur additional costs related to the Ransomware Incident in 2021, but these are not expected to be significant.
Expedited Freight Acquisitions
As part of the Company’s strategy to expand final mile pickup and delivery operations:
•In October 2020, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of CLW Delivery, Inc. (“CLW”) for $5.5 million. CLW specializes in last mile logistics and in-home installation services for national retailers and manufacturers.
•In January 2020, the Company acquired certain assets and liabilities of Linn Star Holdings, Inc., Linn Star Transfer, Inc. and Linn Star Logistics, LLC (collectively, “Linn Star”) for $57.2 million. This acquisition increased the Company’s Final Mile capabilities with an additional 20 locations.
•In April 2019, we acquired certain assets of FSA for $27.0 million in cash and additional contingent consideration (“earn-out”) based upon future revenue generation. The earn-out opportunity is $15.0 million and had a fair value of $6.9 million as of December 31, 2020. This acquisition provides an opportunity for our Expedited Freight segment to expand its final mile service offering into additional geographic markets, form relationships with new customers, and add volumes to our existing locations. The assets, liabilities, and operating results of this acquisition have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition and have been assigned to the Expedited Freight reportable segment.
Intermodal Acquisitions
As part of our strategy to expand our Intermodal operations, in July 2018, we acquired certain assets of Multi-Modal Transport Inc. (“MMT”) for $3.7 million, in October 2018 we acquired certain assets of Southwest Freight Distributors, Inc. (“Southwest”) for $16.3 million and in July 2019 we acquired certain assets and liabilities of O.S.T. for $12.0 million. O.S.T. is a drayage company and provides the Intermodal segment with an expanded footprint on the East Coast, with locations in the Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia markets. In October 2020, we purchased Value Logistics for $2.0 million. These transactions were funded using cash flows from operations and provide an opportunity for our Intermodal segment to expand into additional geographic markets and add volumes to our existing locations. The assets, liabilities, and operating results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition and have been assigned to the Intermodal reportable segment.
See Note 3, Acquisitions, Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets, to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our acquisitions.
Sale of Pool
On February 12, 2021, we sold the Pool segment to Ten Oaks Group for an estimated total consideration of $20 million, consisting of $8 million upfront cash payment and up to a $12 million earnout based on 2021 EBITDA attainment. On April 23, 2020, the Board approved a strategy to divest Pool Distribution (“Pool”) within the next year. Pool provides high-frequency handling and distribution of time sensitive product to numerous destinations within a specific geographic region. Pool offers this service throughout the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Midwest and Southwest United States. Accordingly, Pool has been classified as assets held for sale as of December 31, 2020 and for all prior periods presented. Pool assets and liabilities are reflected as “Assets and liabilities held for sale” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in this Form 10-K.
COVID-19
Our business is highly susceptible to changes in economic conditions. Our products and services are directly tied to the production and sale of goods and, more generally, to the North American economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted economic activity and conditions worldwide and created significant volatility and disruption to financial markets. Efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 led governments and other authorities to impose restrictions which resulted in business closures and disrupted supply chains worldwide. As a result, transportation and supply chain companies such as ours experienced slowdowns and reduced demand for our services.
In 2020, we saw deterioration in volumes across all of our segments and implemented cost reduction and efficiency improvement measures to mitigate the decline in volumes. Notwithstanding our efforts, extended stay at home orders and closures had a material negative impact on our revenues and earnings during the early part of the pandemic with volumes returning to normalized levels by the third quarter of 2020.
Although our business and operations have returned to pre-COVID levels, the situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid and may be further impacted by the policies of President Biden’s administration and the availability and success of a vaccine. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition in 2021 will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to the duration, spread, severity and impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, the effects of the outbreak on our customers and suppliers and the remedial actions and stimulus measures adopted by local and federal governments, and to what extent normal economic and
operating conditions can resume.
In addition, although we believe we have sufficient capital and liquidity to manage our business over the short and long term, our liquidity may be materially affected if conditions in the credit and financial markets deteriorate as a result of COVID-19 including failure by us or our customers to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner.
We periodically evaluate factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, changes in our industry and the markets in which we operate and our market capitalization, as well as our reporting units’ expected future financial performance for purposes of evaluating asset impairments, including goodwill. We believe that the impact of COVID-19 may negatively affect certain key assumptions used in our analysis; however, we will need to assess the severity and nature of the long-term impacts to determine if we may be required to record charges for asset impairments in the future.
Results from Fixed Asset Useful Life and Salvage Value Study
We periodically evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives and salvage values of our equipment. During the third quarter of 2019, we identified indicators that the useful lives of our owned tractors and trailers extended beyond initial estimates. As a result, we changed the useful life of our trailers from seven to ten years and tractors from five to ten years. In addition, we reduced the salvage value of our tractors from 25% to 10%.
The change in estimate was made on a prospective basis beginning July 1, 2019, and the impact of the change was a $2.6 million reduction in depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Results from Operations
The following table sets forth our consolidated historical financial data for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):
Revenues
During the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue increased 4.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The revenue increase was primarily driven by increased revenue from our Expedited Freight segment of $71.4 million, partially offset by the decreased revenue from our Intermodal segment of $18.1 million. The increase in the Expedited Freight segment was driven by the final mile revenue resulting from the acquisition of FSA in April 2019 and Linn Star in January 2020. Both the Expedited Freight segment and the Intermodal segment were impacted by decreased volumes due to the impacts of COVID-19. The results for our two reportable segments are discussed in detail in the following sections.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses increased $92.9 million primarily driven by purchased transportation increases of $64.6 million; other operating expenses of $17.6 million and salaries, wages and employee benefits increases of $12.8 million. Purchased transportation includes Leased Capacity Providers and third-party carriers, while Company-employed drivers are included in salaries, wages and employee benefits. Purchased transportation expense increased due to the utilization of more third-party carriers as it relates to the Expedited Freight segment. Other operating expenses increased primarily due to additional expenses related to vehicle liability claims, severance, litigation reserves and the ransomware incident. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased primarily due to additional salaries resulting from acquisitions.
Income from Continuing Operations and Segment Operations
Income from continuing operations decreased $38.5 million, or 34.3%, from the year ended December 31, 2019 to $73.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by decreases at our Expedited Freight segment and Intermodal segment of $32.3 million and $7.3 million, respectively. The results for our two reportable segments are discussed in detail in the following sections.
Interest Expense, net
Interest expense, net was $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2.7 million for the same period in 2019. The increase in interest expense, net was primarily attributable to additional borrowings on our revolving credit facility and to a lesser extent an interest rate increase associated with the April 2020 amendment to our revolving credit facility.
Income Taxes on a Continuing Basis
The combined federal and state effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 23.9% compared to a rate of 25.0% for the same period in 2019. The lower effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily the result of an increased benefit from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act as well as lower Net Operating Loss utilization in 2020.
(Loss) Income from Discontinued Operation, net of tax
(Loss) income from discontinued operation, net of tax decreased $33.9 million to a $29.1 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $4.8 million of income for the year ended December 31, 2019. (Loss) income from discontinued operations includes the Company's Pool business and, as discussed above, Pool's operations were negatively impacted by COVID-19 as many of its customers were affected by retail mall closures. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2020, a non-cash impairment charge of $28.4 million was recorded to reflect the net assets held for sale at fair value less costs to sell.
Net Income
As a result of the foregoing factors, net income decreased by $63.4 million, or 72.8%, to $23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $87.1 million for the same period in 2019.
Expedited Freight - Year Ended December 31, 2020 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
The following table sets forth our historical financial data of the Expedited Freight segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):
Revenues
Expedited Freight operating revenue increased $71.4 million, or 7.1%, to $1,072.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1,000.9 million for the same period of 2019. The change was primarily due to the increase in the final mile revenue of $123.9 million, partially offset by the decreases in network and truckload revenue. Final mile revenue increased due to the acquisitions of FSA in April 2019 and Linn Star in January 2020.
Network revenue decreased $49.7 million due lower tonnage and shipments as a result of the impacts of COVID-19 as well as the Ransomware Incident. For the network revenue, total shipments declined 1.8% as compared to the prior year, tonnage declined 4.4% as compared to the prior year and revenue per hundredweight declined 1.7% as compared to the prior year. In addition, fuel surcharge revenue decreased $21.4 million, or 20.4%, because of lower fuel prices and decreased tonnage.
Truckload revenue decreased $3.1 million primarily due to a decline in rates driven by both the spot market and contract rate customers, and lower tonnage resulting from the adverse impact of COVID-19.
Purchased Transportation
Expedited Freight purchased transportation increased by $72.0 million, or 14.1%, to $583.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $511.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As a percentage of segment operating revenue, Expedited Freight purchased transportation was 54.5% during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 51.1% for the same period of 2019. Expedited Freight purchased transportation includes Leased Capacity Providers and third-party carriers, while Company-employed drivers are included in salaries, wages and benefits. The increase in purchased transportation as a percentage of segment operating revenue was mostly due to an increase in our cost per mile as a result of increased utilization of third-party carriers, which are typically more costly than Leased Capacity Providers. Also, due to the acquisitions of FSA and Linn Star, the final mile purchased transportation increased over the same period of 2019.
Salaries, Wages, and Benefits
Expedited Freight salaries, wages and employee benefits increased by $17.7 million, or 8.8%, to $218.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $200.7 million in the same period of 2019. Salaries, wages and employee benefits were 20.4% of Expedited Freight’s operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 20.1% for the same period of 2019. The increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of FSA and Linn Star, which accounted for $19.3 million of the increase, and a credit for group health insurance premiums received in the prior year in the amount of $5.1 million. These increases were partially offset by cost-control measures enacted in response to COVID-19.
Operating Leases
Expedited Freight operating leases increased $7.1 million, or 15.2%, to $53.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $46.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Operating leases were 5.0% of Expedited Freight’s operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 4.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to additional facility leases related to the acquisitions of FSA and Linn Star in the amount of $6.2 million and in new tractor rentals in the amount of $1.3 million.
Depreciation and Amortization
Expedited Freight depreciation and amortization decreased $0.4 million, or 1.5%, to $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $27.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of Expedited Freight operating revenue was 2.5% in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Insurance and Claims
Expedited Freight insurance and claims expense increased $0.4 million, or 1.7%, to $24.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Insurance and claims as a percentage of Expedited Freight’s operating revenue was 2.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in expense was primarily attributable to an increase in vehicle insurance premiums, partially offset by favorable claims. See additional discussion over the consolidated increase in self-insurance reserves related to vehicle claims in the “Other Operations” section below.
Fuel Expense
Expedited Freight fuel expense decreased $3.4 million, or 33.3%, to $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $10.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Fuel expense was 0.6% of Expedited Freight’s operating revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 1.0% for 2019. Expedited Freight fuel expenses decreased due to lower fuel prices.
Other Operating Expenses
Expedited Freight other operating expenses increased $10.3 million, or 13.3%, to $87.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $77.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Expedited Freight other operating expenses were 8.2% of operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 7.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other operating expenses include equipment maintenance, facility expenses, legal and professional fees and other over-the-road costs. The increase was primarily attributable to a $8.1 million increase in parts costs related to final mile installations, $5.4 million increase in facility expenses due to the acquisitions of FSA and Linn Star and a $0.5 million increase in the fair value of the earn-out liability from the FSA acquisition due to higher than anticipated revenues.
Income from Operations
Expedited Freight income from operations decreased by $32.3 million, or 31.2%, to $71.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $103.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Expedited Freight’s income from operations was 6.6% of operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 10.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in income from operations was primarily due to lower tonnage, shipments and revenue per hundredweight due to the adverse impacts of COVID-19 and the Ransomware Incident. To a lesser extent, additional costs from the acquisitions of FSA and Linn Star contributed to the decrease through continued integration efforts into the Expedited Freight segment.
Intermodal - Year Ended December 31, 2020 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
The following table sets forth our historical financial data of the Intermodal segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):
Revenues
Intermodal operating revenue decreased $18.1 million, or 8.3%, to $199.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $217.7 million for the same period in 2019. The decrease in Intermodal operating revenue was primarily attributable to a 6.0% decrease in drayage revenue per shipment from prior year, decreased fuel surcharge revenue because of lower fuel prices and a decline in linehaul shipments, partially offset by an increase in per diem revenue.
Purchased Transportation
Intermodal purchased transportation decreased $8.2 million, or 10.7%, to $68.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $76.9 million for the same period in 2019. Intermodal purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was 34.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 35.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Intermodal purchased transportation includes Leased Capacity Providers and third-party carriers, while Company-employed drivers are included in salaries, wages and benefits. The decrease in Intermodal purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was due to operating efficiencies.
Salaries, Wages, and Benefits
Intermodal salaries, wages and employee benefits decreased $4.2 million, or 7.9%, to $48.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $52.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As a percentage of Intermodal operating revenue, salaries, wages and benefits remained essentially flat at 24.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 24.3% for the same period in 2019.
Operating Leases
Intermodal operating leases remained relatively flat only decreasing by $0.1 million, or 0.6% to $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $16.4 million for the same period in 2019. Operating leases were 8.2% of Intermodal operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 7.5% in the same period of 2019.
Depreciation and Amortization
Intermodal depreciation and amortization increased $1.0 million, or 11.2%, to $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $8.9 million for the same period in 2019. Intermodal depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of Intermodal operating revenue was 5.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 4.1% for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization increased due to the equipment acquired from OST as well as the acquired intangibles as part of the acquisition of OST.
Insurance and Claims
Intermodal insurance and claims expense increased $1.2 million, or 17.9%, to $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Intermodal insurance and claims were 4.0% of operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 3.1% for the same period in 2019. The increase in Intermodal insurance and claims was primarily attributable to an increase in vehicle insurance premiums. See additional discussion over the consolidated increase in self-insurance reserves related to vehicle claims in the “Other operations” section below.
Fuel Expense
Intermodal fuel expense decreased $2.2 million, or 28.9%, to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $7.6 million in the same period of 2019. Fuel expenses were 2.7% of Intermodal operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 3.5% in the same period of 2019. Intermodal fuel expense decreased because of lower fuel prices.
Other Operating Expenses
Intermodal other operating expenses increased $1.7 million, or 6.9%, to $26.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $24.6 million for the same period of 2019. Intermodal other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 were 13.2% compared to 11.3% for the same period of 2019. The increase in Intermodal other
operating expense was primarily because of an increase in non recoverable per diem and rail storage expenses incurred as a result of the Ransomware Incident.
Income from Operations
Intermodal’s income from operations decreased by $7.3 million, or 30.8%, to $16.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $23.7 million for the same period in 2019. Income from operations as a percentage of Intermodal operating revenue was 8.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 10.9% in the same period of 2019. The deterioration in operating income was primarily attributable to losing leverage on fixed costs such as salaries, wages and benefits, operating leases, depreciation and amortization and insurance due to the impact of COVID-19.
Other operations - Year Ended December 31, 2020 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Other operating activity decreased from a $14.9 million operating loss during the year ended December 31, 2019 to a $13.8 million operating loss during the year ended December 31, 2020. The year ended December 31, 2020 included self-insurance reserves for vehicle claims of $4.9 million which were related to an increase to our loss development factors for claims. The remaining loss was primarily attributable to a $3.1 million litigation reserve, $1.6 million related to the Ransomware Incident for professional fees, severance of $1.0 million and $3.4 million of corporate costs previously allocated to the Pool segment that are not part of the discontinued operation. These costs represent corporate costs that will remain with the Company after the Pool business is divested.
The $14.9 million operating loss included in other operations and corporate activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 included $6.5 million in vehicular reserves for unfavorable development of second quarter 2019 claims and increases to our loss development factors for vehicle and workers' compensation claims of $2.8 million and $0.3 million, respectively. The loss was also attributed to $3.6 million in costs related to the CEO transition, and $1.1 million of corporate costs previously allocated to the Pool segment that are not part of the discontinued operation.
Results of Operations
The following table sets forth our historical financial data for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in millions):
Revenues
During the year ended December 31, 2019, revenue increased 6.8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The revenue increase was primarily driven by increased revenue from our Expedited Freight segment of $59.0 million driven by increased final mile revenue primarily from the acquisition of FSA in April 2019. The Company’s other segments also had revenue growth over prior year. Intermodal revenue increased 8.3%, primarily due to the acquisition of OST.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses increased $82.4 million primarily driven by purchased transportation increases of $21.8 million and salaries, wages and employee benefits increases of $28.4 million. Company-employed drivers are included in salaries, wages and benefits, while purchased transportation includes Leased Capacity Providers and third-party carriers. Purchased transportation increased primarily due to increased volumes, but decreased as a percentage of revenue due to increased utilization of Leased Capacity Providers and Company-employed drivers, which are typically less costly than third-party transportation providers. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased primarily due to additional headcount from acquisitions, increased Company-employed driver utilization and increased personnel needs to support the additional volumes.
Income from Continuing Operations and Segment Operations
Income from continuing operations decreased $4.8 million, or 4.1%, from the year ended December 31, 2018 to $112.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily driven by a $0.1 million decrease from our Expedited Freight segment and a $0.4 million increase from our Intermodal segment, offset by a $5.1 million decrease in other operations due to a $6.5 million vehicle claims reserve recorded in 2019 for pending vehicular claims. Our Expedited Freight segment operating income decreased $0.4 million due to lower tonnage, higher insurance premiums and a large vehicle claim reserve, mostly offset by improvements in purchased transportation on increased utilization of Leased Capacity Providers and Company-employed drivers and contributions from FSA. Our Intermodal segment saw a slight increase. The results for our two reportable segments are discussed in detail in the following sections.
Interest Expense, net
Interest expense, net was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.8 million for the same period in 2018. The increase in interest expense, net was attributable to additional borrowings on our revolving credit facility.
Income Taxes on a Continuing Basis
The combined federal and state effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 24.9% compared to a rate of 23.2% for the same period in 2018. The higher effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily the result of increased executive compensation in the current year, which was not deductible for income tax purposes. This was partly offset by a reduction in taxable income resulting from the reinstatement of the Alternative Fuel Credit by the Internal Revenue Service on December 20, 2019 and the result of increased share-based compensation vesting when compared to the same period in 2018, which was impacted by forfeited performance shares.
Income from Discontinued Operation, net of tax
Income from discontinued operation, net of tax increased $1.3 million to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Income from discontinued operation includes the Company’s Pool business.
Net Income
As a result of the foregoing factors, net income decreased by $5.0 million, or 5.4%, to $87.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $92.1 million for the same period in 2018.
Expedited Freight - Year Ended December 31, 2019 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
The following table sets forth our historical financial data of the Expedited Freight segment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in millions):
Revenues
Expedited Freight operating revenue increased $59.0 million, or 6.3%, to $1,000.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $941.9 million for the same period of 2018. The increase was due to increased final mile revenue of $61.2 million. Network revenue also had a modest decrease compared to the prior year. Final mile revenue increased primarily due to the acquisition of FSA in April 2019.
Network revenue decreased $2.2 million due to a 4.4% decrease in shipments and a 3.2% decrease in tonnage partly
offset by a 4.1% increase in revenue per hundredweight over prior year. The decrease in shipments and tonnage was due to a
decrease in legacy airport-to-airport shipments. The increase in revenue per hundredweight was due to increased shipment size
and revenue per shipment.
Purchased Transportation
Expedited Freight purchased transportation increased by $20.3 million, or 4.1%, to $511.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $491.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As a percentage of segment operating revenue, Expedited Freight purchased transportation was 51.0% during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 52.1% for the same period of 2018. Expedited Freight purchased transportation includes Leased Capacity Providers and third-party carriers, while Company-employed drivers are included in salaries, wages and benefits. Purchased transportation decreased as a percentage of revenue primarily due to a 300 basis point decrease in Network purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue as linehaul cost per mile decreased on increased utilization of Leased Capacity Providers and Company-employed drivers over more costly third-party transportation providers. This decrease was offset primarily by an increase in final mile purchased transportation due to the acquisition of FSA and deteriorating truckload purchased transportation due to the previously mentioned revenue rate pressures.
Salaries, Wages, and Benefits
Expedited Freight salaries, wages and employee benefits increased by $17.7 million, or 9.7%, to $200.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $183.0 million in the same period of 2018. Salaries, wages and employee benefits were 20.1% of Expedited Freight’s operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 19.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in total dollars and as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to $14.7 million for additional headcount and employee wages, of which $12.1 million was due to the acquisition of FSA. An additional $6.2 million increase was due to increased utilization of Company-employed drivers to fulfill linehaul and local pickup and delivery services. These increases were partly offset by a $3.9 million decrease of employee incentives.
Operating Leases
Expedited Freight operating leases increased $4.5 million, or 10.7%, to $46.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $42.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Operating leases were 4.7% of Expedited Freight’s operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 4.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in cost was primarily due to a $2.8 million increase in facility leases mostly from additional facilities acquired from FSA and a $2.9 million increase in tractor rentals and leases to correspond with the increase in Company-employed driver usage mentioned above. These increases were partly offset by a $1.1 million decrease in trailer rentals and leases, as old leases were replaced with purchased trailers.
Depreciation and Amortization
Expedited Freight depreciation and amortization decreased $1.8 million, or 6.2%, to $27.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $29.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of Expedited Freight operating revenue was 2.7% in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 3.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in total dollars was primarily due to a $1.9 million decrease in trailer depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily related to extending the useful lives of its trailers from seven to ten years as discussed above. Tractor depreciation decreased $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to decreasing the salvage value of tractors from 25% to 10% as discussed above, partly offset by a decrease in tractor depreciation, as older units were replaced with tractor leases mentioned above. The net decrease of trailer and tractor depreciation of $2.5 million was partly offset by a $0.8 million of increased amortization of acquired intangibles from FSA.
Insurance and Claims
Expedited Freight insurance and claims expense increased $5.0 million, or 26.9%, to $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Insurance and claims as a percentage of Expedited Freight’s operating revenue was 2.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was attributable to a $1.0 million vehicle claim reserve recorded in the second quarter of 2019 for pending vehicular claims and a $1.8 million increase in vehicle insurance premiums. The increase was also attributable to higher accident related vehicle damage repairs, cargo claims and claims related fees. See additional discussion over the consolidated increase in self-insurance reserves related to vehicle claims in the “Other Operations” section below.
Fuel Expense
Expedited Freight fuel expense increased $0.7 million, or 7.4%, to $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $9.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Fuel expense was 1.0% of Expedited Freight’s operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Expedited Freight fuel expenses increased due to higher Company-employed driver miles.
Other Operating Expenses
Expedited Freight other operating expenses increased $12.7 million, or 19.7%, to $77.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $64.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Expedited Freight other operating expenses were 7.7% of operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 6.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in total dollars and as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to a $2.8 million increase in parts costs for final mile installations due to the acquisition of FSA and a $1.5 million increase in loss on operating assets due to reserves for and sales of tractors. See additional discussion regarding the fixed asset useful life study above. The increase was also attributable to a $1.3 million increase in legal and professional fees and $1.2 million in higher travel-related expenses. Additionally, receivables allowance increased $0.8 million due to the third quarter of 2018 including a recovery of a previously reserved receivable. The remaining increase was due to increased terminal and office expenses and other over-the-road costs, including tolls.
Income from Operations
Expedited Freight income from operations decreased by $0.1 million, or 0.1%, to $103.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $103.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Expedited Freight’s income from operations was 10.4% of operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 11.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in income from operations was due to lower tonnage, higher insurance premiums and a large vehicle claim reserve, mostly offset by improvements in Network gross margin on increased utilization of Leased Capacity Providers and Company-employed drivers and contributions from FSA.
Intermodal - Year Ended December 31, 2019 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
The following table sets forth our historical financial data of the Intermodal segment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in millions):
Revenues
Intermodal operating revenue increased $16.7 million, or 8.3%, to $217.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $201.0 million for the same period in 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in drayage shipments from the acquisition of O.S.T. that occurred in July 2019 and the acquisition of Southwest that occurred in November 2018. The increase was also attributable to revenue rate increases and fuel surcharge revenue on higher drayage shipments and higher fuel surcharge rates.
Purchased Transportation
Intermodal purchased transportation decreased $0.2 million, or 0.3%, to $76.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $77.1 million for the same period in 2018. Intermodal purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was 35.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 38.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Intermodal purchased transportation includes Leased Capacity Providers and third-party carriers, while Company-employed drivers are included in salaries, wages and benefits. The decrease in Intermodal purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was attributable to increased utilization of Company-employed drivers compared to the same period in 2018 and operating efficiencies.
Salaries, Wages, and Benefits
Intermodal salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $9.0 million, or 20.5%, to $52.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $43.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As a percentage of Intermodal operating revenue, salaries, wages and benefits decreased to 24.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 21.8% for the same period in 2018. The 2.5% increase in salaries, wages and employee benefits as a percentage of revenue was attributable to a 1.3% increase from utilization of Company-employed drivers and a 1.3% increase from higher administrative salaries, wages and benefits as a percentage of revenue. The increase as a percentage of revenue was also attributable to a 0.4% increase in group health insurance and workers compensation as a percentage of revenue. These increases were partly offset by a 0.3% decrease as a percentage of revenue in incentive and share based compensation to employees and a 0.2% improvement in dock pay as a percentage of revenue. The increase in administrative salaries, wages and benefits as a percentage of revenue was due to additional headcount from the acquisitions of O.S.T., Southwest and MMT.
Operating Leases
Intermodal operating leases increased $0.5 million, or 3.1% to $16.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $15.9 million for the same period in 2018. Operating leases were 7.5% of Intermodal operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 7.9% in the same period of 2018. The decrease as a percentage of revenue was attributable to a 0.7% decrease in trailer rental charges as a percentage of revenue. This decrease as a percentage of revenue was partly offset by increases in facility rent from acquired companies and tractor rentals and leases to correspond with the increase in Company-employed driver usage mentioned above.
Depreciation and Amortization
Intermodal depreciation and amortization increased $2.6 million, or 41.3%, to $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $6.3 million for the same period in 2018. Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of Intermodal operating revenue was 4.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 3.8% for the same period of 2018. The increase was due to $1.2 million increase in amortization of acquired intangibles. The increase in depreciation and amortization was also attributable to a $1.4 million increase in depreciation of equipment partly due to the equipment acquired from O.S.T..
Insurance and Claims
Intermodal insurance and claims expense increased $0.9 million, or 15.5%, to $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Intermodal insurance and claims were 3.1% of operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2.9% for the same period in 2018. The increase in Intermodal insurance and claims was primarily attributable to an increase in vehicle insurance premiums. See additional discussion over the consolidated increase in self-insurance reserves related to vehicle claims in the “Other Operations” section below.
Fuel Expense
Intermodal fuel expense increased $1.0 million, or 15.2%, to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $6.6 million in the same period of 2018. Fuel expenses were 3.5% of Intermodal operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 3.3% in the same period of 2018. Intermodal fuel expenses increased due to increased Company-employed driver usage mentioned above.
Other Operating Expenses
Intermodal other operating expenses increased $2.5 million, or 11.3%, to $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $22.1 million for the same period of 2018. Intermodal other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 were 11.3% compared to 11.0% for the same period of 2018. The increase in Intermodal other operating expense was due mostly to a $1.0 million increase in container related rental and storage charges and a $0.6 million increase in acquisition related legal and professional fees. In 2018, a $0.5 million reduction in the earn-out liability for the Atlantic acquisition was recorded. A similar benefit in the earn-out liability was not recorded in 2019. The remaining increase was due to increased terminal and office expenses and other over-the-road costs, including tolls.
Income from Operations
Intermodal’s income from operations increased by $0.4 million, or 1.7%, to $23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $23.3 million for the same period in 2018. Income from operations as a percentage of Intermodal operating revenue was 10.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 11.6% in the same period of 2018. The increase in operating income in total dollars was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of O.S.T., Southwest and MMT. These increases were partly offset by higher amortization and professional fees related to acquisitions and the prior period including a $0.5 million benefit from the reduction of an earn-out liability, which led to the deterioration in income from operations as a percentage of revenue.
Other operations - Year Ended December 31, 2019 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
Other operating activity declined from a $9.8 million operating loss during the year ended December 31, 2018 to an $14.9 million operating loss during the year ended December 31, 2019. The year ended December 31, 2019 included $6.5 million in vehicular reserves for unfavorable development of second quarter 2019 claims and increases to our loss development factors for vehicle and workers’ compensation claims of $2.8 million and $0.3 million, respectively. The loss was also attributed to $3.6 million in costs related to the CEO transition.
The $9.8 million operating loss for the year ending December 31, 2018 included a $6.0 million increase in self-insurance reserves related to existing vehicular claims and $0.8 million in self- insurance reserves resulting from workers' compensation claims. The loss was also attributable to $1.1 million in costs related to the CEO transition, comprised of recruiting fees and retention share awards.
Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and changes in the business environment. However, actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions, sometimes materially. The significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the financial statements are detailed in Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management’s most subjective judgments. We believe that our application of the policies discussed below involves significant levels of judgment, estimates and complexity. Due to the levels of judgment, complexity and period of time over which many of these items are resolved, actual results could differ from those estimated at the time of preparation of the financial statements. Adjustments to these estimates would impact our financial position and future results of operations.
Self-Insurance Loss Reserves
We provide for the estimated costs of vehicle liability and workers’ compensation claims both reported and for claims incurred but not reported. The amount of self-insurance loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses is determined based on an estimation process that uses information obtained from both our-specific and industry data, as well as general economic information. We estimate our self-insurance loss exposure by evaluating the merits and circumstances surrounding individual known claims and through actuarial analysis to determine an estimate of probable losses on claims incurred but not reported. If the events underlying the claims have occurred as of the balance sheet date, then losses are recognized immediately. Historically, we have experienced both favorable and unfavorable development of claim estimates.
The estimation process for self-insurance loss exposure requires management to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of claims. Using data obtained from this monitoring and our assumptions about the emerging trends, management develops an estimate of ultimate claims based on its historical experience and other available market information. The most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trend in loss costs, the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported, changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date, and expected costs to settle unpaid claims. We utilize quarterly actuarial analyses to evaluate open claims and estimate the ongoing development exposure.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded insurance reserves of $72.7 million and $66.2 million, respectively, inclusive of reserves in excess of the self-insured retention limit that are expected to be reimbursed from insurance carriers. Additionally, we recognized a receivable for insurance proceeds and a corresponding claims payable for vehicle liability and workers’ compensation claims in excess of the self-insured retention limit in the amount of $36.7 million and $34.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Business Combinations and Goodwill
Acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method. Upon the acquisition of a business, the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed must be estimated. This requires judgments regarding the identification of acquired assets and
liabilities assumed, some of which may not have been previously recorded by the acquired business, as well as judgments regarding the valuation of all identified acquired assets and assumed liabilities. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are determined by reviewing the operations, interviewing management and reviewing the financial and contractual information of the acquired business. Consideration is typically paid in the form of cash paid upon closing or contingent consideration paid upon satisfaction of a future obligation. If contingent consideration is included in the purchase price, we value that consideration as of the acquisition date and it is recorded to goodwill.
Once the acquired assets and assumed liabilities are identified, the fair value of the assets and liabilities are estimated using a variety of approaches that require significant judgments. For example, intangible assets are typically valued using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis, which requires estimates of the future cash flows that are attributable to the intangible asset. A DCF analysis also requires significant judgments regarding the selection of discount rates that are intended to reflect the risks that are inherent in the projected cash flows, the determination of terminal growth rates, and judgments about the useful life and pattern of use of the underlying intangible asset. The valuation of acquired property, plant and equipment requires judgments about current market values, replacement costs, the physical and functional obsolescence of the assets and their remaining useful lives. A failure to appropriately assign a fair value to acquired assets and assumed liabilities could significantly impact the amount and timing of future depreciation and amortization expense, as well as significantly overstate or understate assets or liabilities.
Goodwill is recorded at cost based on the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but rather we conduct an annual, or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment, impairment test of goodwill for each reporting unit at June 30 of each year. Examples of such events or circumstances could include a significant change in business climate or a loss of significant customers. Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives.
Assets Classified as Held for Sale
We evaluate our assets held for sale upon meeting the criteria for held for sale classification and in each subsequent reporting period to determine whether the fair value, less costs to sell, exceeds the net carrying value. The fair value is estimated based on a combination of an income approach using a discounted cash flow model, and a market approach, which considers comparable companies. Estimates of future cash flows are based on various factors, including current operating results, expected market trends and competitive influences. We make various assumptions regarding future cash flows, market multiples, growth rates and discount rates in our estimate of the fair value of assets held for sale. These assumptions require significant judgments and the conclusions reached could vary significantly based upon these judgments.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have historically financed our working capital needs, including capital expenditures, with cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe that borrowings under our revolving credit facility, together with available cash and internally generated funds, will be sufficient to support our working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future.
We use LIBOR as a reference rate in our revolving credit facility to calculate interest due to our lender. In the event the LIBOR is no longer published, we have amended our revolving credit facility to include provisions to address establishing a replacement benchmark rate.
In April 2020, we entered into an amendment to the revolving credit facility, which increased the maximum aggregate principal amount to $225.0 million. The senior credit facility may be increased by up to $25.0 million to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million pursuant to the terms of the amended credit agreement, subject to the lenders’ agreement to increase their commitments or the addition of new lenders extending such commitments. Such increases may be in the form of additional revolving credit loans, term loans or a combination thereof, and are contingent upon there being no events of default. We are in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the senior credit facility and expect to continue to maintain such compliance. Should we ever encounter difficulties, our historical relationship with our lenders has been strong and we anticipate their continued support of our business. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional information regarding our revolving credit facility.

The $8.2 million decrease in cash used in continuing financing activities was attributable to a $45.0 million increase in net borrowings on the revolving credit facility and a $11.0 million decrease in the repurchase of common stock. These decreases in cash used were partially offset by a $20.0 million repayment on the revolving credit facility, a $20.5 million increase in distributions to a subsidiary held for sale (Pool) and a $5.3 million payment on the FSA earn-out.
Discontinued Operation
Net cash used in discontinued operating activities was approximately $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash provided by discontinued operating activities was approximately $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $24.9 million decrease in cash provided by discontinued operating activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in discontinued net earnings after consideration of non-cash items. The non-cash items for the year ended December 31, 2020 included an impairment charge of $28.4 million to impair Pool's goodwill balance of $5.4 million and the establishment of a valuation allowance of $23.0 million against Pool's assets held for sale.

Continuing Operations
Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations totaled approximately $145.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to approximately $142.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $3.1 million increase in cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was mainly attributable to an improvement in the collection of receivables and a decrease in estimated income tax payments. This increase was partly offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses, an increase in prepaid expenses due to the purchase of cloud-based software and a decrease in net earnings after consideration of non-cash items.
Net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was approximately $58.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared with approximately $52.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.

The proceeds from disposal of property and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were primarily from sales of older trailers.
Net cash used in financing activities of continuing operations totaled approximately $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared with net cash used in financing activities of $68.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $20.3 million decrease was attributable to a $13.0 million increase in net borrowings from our revolving credit facility. The year ended December 31, 2019 also included $56.2 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock, which was a $9.9 million decrease from the $66.1 million used to repurchase shares of common stock for the same period of 2018. These were partly offset by a $2.0 million increase in payments of cash dividends due to an increase in dividend per share from $0.63 per share in the year ended December 31, 2018 to $0.72 per share in the year ended December 31, 2019, partly offset by a decrease in the outstanding share count during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. Additionally, there was a $0.9 million decrease in cash from employee stock transactions and related tax benefits and a $0.7 million increase in payments of debt and finance lease obligations as well as a $1.0 million increase in contributions from a subsidiary held for sale (Pool).
Discontinued Operation

Net cash used in discontinued financing activities was approximately $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to net cash used in discontinued financing activities of $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The
$1.0 million increase in cash used in discontinued financing activities was attributable to distributions to the parent as discussed above.
Share Repurchase Program
During 2020 and 2019, we repurchased 0.8 million and 0.9 million shares of our common stock, respectively, for approximately $45.2 million and $56.2 million, respectively, through open market transactions. All shares received were retired upon receipt, and the excess of the purchase price over par value per share was recorded to “Retained Earnings” within our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Contractual Obligations
The future payments required under our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
At December 31, 2020, we had letters of credit outstanding from banks totaling $18.3 million required primarily by our workers’ compensation and vehicle liability insurance providers.
