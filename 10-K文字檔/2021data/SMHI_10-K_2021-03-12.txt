MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) below presents the Company’s operating results for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and its financial condition as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Certain statements in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations constitute forward looking statements. See “Forward Looking Statements” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
The Company provides global marine and support transportation services to offshore energy facilities worldwide. As of December 31, 2020, excluding its CTV Assets Held for Sale, the Company and its joint ventures operated a diverse fleet of 101 support and specialty vessels, of which 64 were owned or leased-in, 35 were joint-ventured, and 2 were managed on behalf of unaffiliated third-parties. The primary users of the Company’s services are major integrated oil companies, large independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies and emerging independent companies, as well as windfarm operations and installation contractors.
The Company and its joint ventures operate and manage a diverse fleet of offshore support vessels that (i) deliver cargo and personnel to offshore installations including wind farms, (ii) handle anchors and mooring equipment required to tether rigs to the seabed, and assist in placing them on location and moving them between regions, (iii) provide construction, well work-over, maintenance and decommissioning support and (iv) carry and launch equipment used underwater in drilling and well installation, maintenance, inspection and repair. Additionally, the Company’s vessels provide accommodations for technicians and specialists.

On February 24, 2021, SEACOR Marine, Falcon Global USA LLC (“FGUSA”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and certain subsidiaries of FGUSA, entered into a Seventh Consent, Agreement and Omnibus Amendments (the “Seventh FGUSA Credit Facility Amendment”) to that certain (i) $131.1 million term and revolving loan facility, dated as of February 8, 2018, with a syndicate of lenders administered by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (as amended, the “FGUSA Credit Facility”) and (ii) obligation guaranty issued by SEACOR Marine, dated February 8, 2018, pursuant to which SEACOR Marine provides a guarantee of certain limited obligations of FGUSA under the Credit Facility (as amended, the “FGUSA Guaranty”).
The Seventh FGUSA Credit Facility Amendment provides for, among other things, (i) the extension from March 2021 to June 2021 of the commencement of monthly repayment of the term loan, with such monthly payments being the lesser of (a) $0.8 million and (b) the amount outstanding under the term loan, (ii) the extension of the FGUSA Guaranty for an additional three months from February 8, 2021 to May 8, 2021, (iii) that the audited financial statements of FGUSA and its consolidated subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 are not required to be without a “going concern” or like qualification, commentary or exception, and (iv) the extension of the deadline for delivery of certain physical vessel appraisals from April 30, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
Sale of Windcat Workboats. On January 12, 2021, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the sale of the Windcat Workboats CTV Business through the sale of 100% of the equity of Windcat Workboats (together with its subsidiaries, the “Windcat Group”), to CMB N.V. (the “Windcat Buyer”) pursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement entered into on December 18, 2020 (the “Windcat Sale”). At closing, the Windcat Buyer paid to the Company an aggregate purchase price of £32.8 million. After deducting transaction costs and expenses and giving effect to foreign exchange rate hedges, the Company received net cash proceeds of approximately US$42.6 million. The Windcat Buyer also assumed all of the approximately £20.4 million of debt outstanding under Windcat Holdings’ existing revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2020, the Windcat Group owned a total of 41 CTVs and held interests in an additional five CTVs through its joint ventures, all of which were included in the Windcat Sale. These vessels have been classified as and included as Assets held-for sale as of December 31, 2020. The Company recognized a gain on the sale of Windcat Workboats in January 2021 of approximately $22.8 million.
Amendment to SEACOR Marine Foreign Holdings Credit Facility. On December 18, 2020, SEACOR Marine, as parent guarantor, SMFH, and DNB Bank ASA, New York Branch, as facility agent on behalf of the lenders under that certain credit agreement and related parent guaranty, dated September 26, 2018 (as amended), entered into a letter agreement (the “Letter Agreement”) pursuant to which an estimated $31.2 million tax refund receivable from the IRS under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) will be treated as cash or cash equivalents, for the period up to and including January 31, 2021, for purposes of calculating the Company’s cash or cash equivalent balances required under the parent guaranty of the Company.
Trends Affecting the Offshore Marine Business
The market for offshore oil and natural gas drilling has historically been cyclical. Demand for offshore support vessels is highly correlated to the price of oil and natural gas as those prices significantly impact the Company’s customers’ exploration and drilling activity levels. Oil and natural gas prices tend to fluctuate based on many factors, including global economic activity, levels of reserves and production activity. Price levels for oil and natural gas have and will continue to influence demand for offshore marine services. In addition to the price of oil and natural gas, the availability of acreage, local tax incentives or disincentives, drilling moratoriums and other regulatory actions, and requirements for maintaining interests in leases affect activity in the offshore oil and natural gas industry. Factors that influence the level of offshore exploration and drilling activities include:
•
expectations as to future oil and natural gas commodity prices;
•
customer assessments of offshore drilling prospects compared with land-based opportunities, including newer or unconventional opportunities such as shale;
•
customer assessments of cost, geological opportunity and political stability in host countries;
•
worldwide demand for oil and natural gas;
•
the ability or willingness of OPEC to set and maintain production levels and pricing;
•
the level of oil and natural gas production by non-OPEC countries;
•
the relative exchange rates for the U.S. dollar; and
•
various U.S. and international government policies regarding exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves.
Offshore oil and natural gas market conditions are highly volatile. Prices deteriorated beginning in the second half of 2014 and continued to deteriorate when oil prices hit a thirteen-year low of less than $27 per barrel (on the New York Mercantile Exchange) in February 2016. Oil prices were as high as $76 per barrel in October 2018 and, during the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic in the US and elsewhere throughout the globe, WTI front month oil prices were pushed for a short period of time to a new low of -$37.63 per barrel in April 2020 before recovering to $48 per barrel by year end. The Company has continued to experience difficult market conditions as the overall decline and continued volatility in oil and natural gas prices, have led to a general decrease in exploration and production activities, and a particular decrease in offshore drilling associated activity. The Company’s operating results have been negatively impacted as oil and gas producing companies focused on cost reduction and cut capital spending budgets. Although the underlying commodity prices supporting activity have recovered substantially since year end 2020, with oil hitting a high of approximately $65 per barrel in early March 2021, the risk of continued volatility in the commodity prices remains.
Certain macro drivers somewhat independent of oil and natural gas prices have the ability to continue to support the Company’s business, including: (i) underspending by oil and gas producers during the current industry downturn leading to pent up demand for maintenance and growth capital expenditures; and (ii) improved extraction technologies. While alternative forms of energy may continue to grow and add to the world’s energy mix, for the foreseeable future, the Company believes demand for gasoline and oil will be sustained, as well as demand for electricity from natural gas. These alternative forms of energy include offshore wind facilities which also have the opportunity to support the Company’s business.
Low oil prices and the subsequent decline in offshore exploration have forced many operators in the industry to restructure or liquidate assets. The Company continues to closely monitor the delivery of newly built offshore support vessels to the industry-wide fleet, which is creating situations of oversupply, thereby further lowering the demand for the Company’s existing offshore support vessel fleet. A continuation of (i) low customer exploration and drilling activity levels, and (ii) continued excess supply of offshore support vessels whether from laid up fleets or newly built vessels could, in isolation or together, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
The Company adheres to a strategy of cold-stacking vessels (removing from active service) during periods of weak utilization in order to reduce the daily running costs of operating the fleet, primarily personnel, repairs and maintenance costs, as well as to defer some drydocking costs into future periods. The Company considers various factors in determining which vessels to cold-stack, including upcoming dates for regulatory vessel inspections and related docking requirements. The Company may maintain class certification on certain cold-stacked vessels, thereby incurring some drydocking costs while cold-stacked. Cold-stacked vessels are returned to active service when market conditions improve, or management anticipates improvement, typically leading to increased costs for drydocking, personnel, repair and maintenance in the periods immediately preceding the vessels’ return to active service. Depending on market conditions, vessels with similar characteristics and capabilities may be rotated between active service and cold-stack. On an ongoing basis, the Company reviews its cold-stacked vessels to determine if any should be designated as retired and removed from service based on the vessel's physical condition, the expected costs to reactivate and restore class certification, if any, and its viability to operate within current and projected market conditions. As of December 31, 2020, 22 of the Company’s 64 owned and leased-in in-service vessels were cold-stacked worldwide.
The Company’s operations and financial results were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of decreased demand and the increase in costs due to operational changes enacted to enhance crew and on-share employee safety. However, the Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations for the foreseeable future, especially after receipt of the proceeds from the sale of Windcat Workboats and the anticipated tax refund under the CARES Act.
Certain Components of Revenues and Expenses
The Company operates its fleet in five principal geographic regions: the U.S., primarily in the Gulf of Mexico; Africa, primarily in West Africa; the Middle East and Asia; Latin America, primarily in Mexico, Brazil and Guyana; and Europe, primarily in the North Sea. The Company’s vessels are highly mobile and regularly and routinely move between countries within a geographic region. In addition, the Company’s vessels are also redeployed among the geographic regions, subject to flag restrictions, as changes in market conditions dictate. The number and type of vessels operated, their rates per day worked and their utilization levels are the key determinants of the Company’s operating results and cash flows. Unless a vessel is cold-stacked, there is little reduction in daily running costs and, consequently, operating margins are most sensitive to changes in rates per day worked and utilization. The Company manages its fleet by utilizing a global network of shore side support, administrative and finance personnel.
Time charter statistics are the key performance indicators for the Company’s time charter revenues. The rate per day worked is the ratio of total time charter revenues to the aggregate number of days worked. Utilization is the ratio of aggregate number of days worked to total available days for all vessels available for time charter. Unless vessels have been retired and removed from service, available days represents the total calendar days for which vessels available for time charter were owned or leased-in by the Company, whether marketed, under repair, cold-stacked or otherwise out-of-service.
Operating Revenues. The Company generates revenues by providing services to customers primarily pursuant to two different types of contractual arrangements: time charters and bareboat charters. Under a time charter, the Company provides a vessel to a customer and is responsible for all operating expenses, typically excluding fuel. Under a bareboat charter, the Company provides a vessel to a customer and the customer assumes responsibility for all operating expenses and all risks of operation. Vessel charters may range from several days to several years.
Direct Operating Expenses. The aggregate cost of operating the Company’s fleet depends primarily on the size and asset mix of the fleet. The Company’s direct operating costs and expenses, other than leased-in equipment expense, are grouped into the following categories:
•
personnel (primarily wages, benefits, payroll taxes, savings plans and travel for marine personnel);
•
repairs and maintenance (primarily routine repairs and maintenance and main engine overhauls that are performed in accordance with planned maintenance programs);
•
drydocking (primarily the cost of regulatory drydockings performed in accordance with applicable regulations);
•
insurance and loss reserves (primarily the cost of Hull and Machinery and Protection and Indemnity insurance premiums and loss deductibles);
•
fuel, lubes and supplies; and
•
other (communication costs, expenses incurred in mobilizing vessels between geographic regions, third-party ship management fees, freight expenses, customs and importation duties and other).
The Company expenses drydocking, engine overhaul and vessel mobilization costs as incurred. If a disproportionate number of drydockings, overhauls or mobilizations are undertaken in a particular fiscal year or quarter, operating expenses may vary significantly when compared with the prior year or prior quarter.
Direct Vessel Profit. Direct vessel profit (defined as operating revenues less operating expenses excluding leased-in equipment, “DVP”) is the Company’s measure of segment profitability when applied to reportable segments and a non-GAAP measure when applied to individual vessels, fleet categories or the combined fleet. DVP is a critical financial measure used by the Company to analyze and compare the operating performance of its individual vessels, fleet categories, regions and combined fleet, without regard to financing decisions (depreciation for owned vessels vs. leased-in expense for leased-in vessels). DVP is also useful when comparing the Company’s fleet’s performance against those of its competitors who may have differing fleet financing structures. DVP has some limitations in that it does not take into account all expenses related to the operation of the fleet and, more significantly, the Company.
Leased-in Equipment. In addition to the Company’s owned fleet, it operates leased-in vessels from lessors under bareboat charter arrangements that currently expire in 2021. Certain of these vessels were previously owned and subject of sale and leaseback transactions with their lessors.
Impairments. As a result of the difficult conditions experienced in the offshore oil and natural gas markets beginning in the second half of 2014 and the corresponding reductions in utilization and rates per day worked of its fleet, the Company identified indicators of impairment and has over the past few years recognized impairment charges primarily associated with its AHTS fleet, its liftboat fleet, certain specialty vessels and vessels removed from service. When reviewing its fleet for impairment, the Company groups vessels with similar operating and marketing characteristics, including cold-stacked vessels expected to return to active service, into vessel classes. All other vessels, including vessels retired and removed from service, are evaluated for impairment on a vessel by vessel basis.
During 2020, the Company recorded impairment charges of $13.5 million associated with its liftboat fleet (five owned and two leased-in vessels), and one specialty vessel and recognized net losses of $5.3 million as a result of asset disposals ($4.8 million loss due to the disposal of one vessel under construction, and $0.5 million loss due to the redelivery of one leased-in AHTS vessel and one leased-in liftboat). During 2019, the Company recorded impairment charges of $12.0 million primarily associated with its AHTS fleet (four owned and one leased-in vessel), four FSVs and one leased-in specialty vessel. During 2018, the Company recorded impairment charges of $14.6 million primarily associated with its AHTS fleet (four owned and three leased-in vessels) and one specialty vessel. Estimated fair values for the Company’s owned vessels were established by independent appraisers and other market data such as recent sales of similar vessels. For information regarding the Company’s vessel fair value measurement determinations, see “Note 11. Fair Value Measurements” in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If market conditions continue to decline from the presently depressed utilization and rates per day worked experienced over the last three years, fair values based on future appraisals could decline significantly.
The Company’s other vessel classes and other individual vessels in active service and cold-stacked status, for which no impairment was deemed necessary, have generally experienced a less severe decline in utilization and rates per day worked based on specific market factors. The market factors include vessels with more general utility to a broader range of customers (e.g., FSVs), vessels required for customers to meet regulatory mandates and operating under multiple year contracts or vessels that service customers outside of the offshore oil and natural gas market (e.g., CTVs).
For vessel classes and individual vessels with indicators of impairment, but which were not impaired as of December 31, 2020, the Company has estimated that their future undiscounted cash flows exceed their current carrying values by more than 40%. The Company’s estimates of future undiscounted cash flows are highly subjective as utilization and rates per day worked are uncertain, including the timing of an estimated market recovery in the offshore oil and natural gas markets and the timing and cost of reactivating cold-stacked vessels. If market conditions decline further, or remain stagnant at current levels, changes in the Company’s expectations on future cash flows may result in recognizing additional impairment charges related to its long-lived assets in future periods.

2020 compared with 2019
Operating Revenues. Time charter and bareboat charter revenues were $27.7 million lower in 2020 compared with 2019. On an overall basis, charter revenues were $21.5 million lower due to lower utilization of the core fleet and $6.2 million lower due to net fleet dispositions. Other Marine Services were $1.4 million lower primarily due to lower liftboat catering revenues. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 15 of 20 owned and leased-in vessels cold-stacked in this region (two AHTS, four FSVs, and nine liftboats) compared with 14 of 25 vessels as of December 31, 2019.
Direct Operating Expenses. Direct operating expenses were $19.2 million lower in 2020 compared with 2019. Direct operating expenses were $15.4 million lower for the core fleet, primarily due to reduced personnel, repair and drydocking cost, and $3.8 million lower due to net fleet dispositions.
2019 compared with 2018
Operating Revenues. Time charter revenues were $0.2 million higher in 2019 compared with 2018. On an overall basis, time charter revenues were $2.7 million higher due to net fleet additions and $0.5 million higher due to improved utilization and an increase in average dayrates. Time charter revenues were $3.0 million lower due to the repositioning of vessels between geographic regions. Other Marine Services were $9.4 million lower primarily due to the recognition in 2018 of revenue previously deferred due to collection concerns following the receipt of cash and due to the commencement of a bareboat contract in 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had 14 of 25 owned and leased-in vessels cold-stacked in this region (two AHTS vessels, three FSVs, eight liftboats and one specialty vessel) compared with 18 of 30 vessels as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had two AHTS vessels retired and removed from service in this region.
Direct Operating Expenses. Direct operating expenses were $2.7 million higher in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to the repositioning of vessels between geographic regions and higher repair and maintenance costs.

As of December 31, 2019, the Company had no owned or leased-in vessels cold-stacked in this region compared with one of seven vessels as of December 31, 2018.
Direct Operating Expenses. Direct operating expenses were $0.1 million higher in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to changes in fleet mix and the repositioning of vessels between geographic regions.
Europe, primarily North Sea. For the years ended December 31, the Company’s direct vessel profit from continuing operations in Europe was as follows (in thousands, except statistics):
2020 compared with 2019
Operating Revenues. Time charter revenues were $3.7 million higher in 2020 compared to 2019, due to the repositioning of vessels between geographic regions. Other Marine Services were $3.6 million lower in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to the termination of a charter of a PSV from a joint venture. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had one of two owned vessels cold-stacked in this region (one PSV) compared with no cold-stacked vessels as of December 31, 2019.
Direct Operating Expenses. Vessel operating expenses were $1.0 million lower in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the termination of a charter-in of a PSV from a joint venture.
2019 compared with 2018
Operating Revenues. Time charter revenues were $8.2 million higher in 2019 compared to 2018, due to the repositioning of vessels between geographic regions. Other Marine Services were $2.6 million higher in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to the charter in of a PSV from a joint venture.
Direct Operating Expenses. Direct operating expenses were $0.3 million higher in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to increased costs associated with the repositioning of one liftboat between geographic regions.
Leased-in Equipment. Leased-in expenses were $8.3 million lower for 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to the impairment of three leased-in vessels and one leased-in vessel having been returned to the lessor in the first quarter of 2020. Leased-in equipment expenses were $2.6 million higher for 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to the implementation of the new lease accounting standard, which removed the quarterly $2.3 million benefit of amortization of deferred gains on sale-leaseback vessels recognized in 2018 under the old standard. Had this benefit been allowed to be recognized in 2019, this benefit would have been partially reduced by the impairment and removal from service of two leased-in vessels during 2018.
Administrative and general. Administrative and general expenses were $0.3 million higher in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to a transaction fee paid to SEACOR Holdings under the Tax Refund and Indemnification Agreement entered into by the Company and SEACOR Holdings on June 26, 2020 (the “Tax Refund Agreement”), offset by decreases in employee and director compensation expenses.
Administrative and general expenses were $1.8 million lower in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to lower shared service fees, offset by costs associated with the transformation plan (the “Transformation Plan”). The Transformation Plan contains $3.7 million of Administration and General expenses. Absent the $3.7 million of expense related to the Transformation Plan, Administrative and General expenses would have been $5.5 million lower than 2018.
Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses were flat when comparing 2020 with 2019.
Depreciation and amortization expenses were $4.3 million lower in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to net fleet dispositions.
Losses on Asset Dispositions and Impairments, Net. During 2020, the Company recorded impairment charges of $13.5 million associated with its liftboat fleet (five owned and two leased-in vessels), one specialty vessel and recognized net losses of $5.3 million ($4.8 million loss due to the disposal of one vessel under construction, and $0.5 million loss due to the redelivery of one leased-in AHTS vessel and one leased-in liftboat). The Company sold two AHTS vessels and one specialty vessel previously removed from service, four FSVs, one specialty, one vessel under construction and other equipment for $21.6 million and gains of $1.2 million.
During 2019, the Company recorded impairment charges of $12.0 million associated with its AHTS fleet (four owned and one leased vessel), four FSVs and one leased-in supply vessel. The Company sold one AHTS vessel, seven FSVs, five supply vessels and three liftboats. In addition, the Company sold five AHTS vessels and one specialty vessel previously retired and removed from service and other equipment for aggregate net proceeds of $55.3 million and gains of $5.5 million.
During 2018, the Company recorded impairment charges of $14.6 million associated with its AHTS fleet (four owned and three leased vessels) and one specialty vessel. The Company sold one AHTS vessel, nine FSVs, one supply vessel and two liftboats. In addition, the Company sold one FSV, one tow-supply vessel and one supply vessel previously retired and removed from service and other equipment for net proceeds of $10.7 million and gains of $5.0 million.
Other (Expense) Income, Net
For the years ended December 31, the Company’s other income (expense) was as follows (in thousands):
Interest Income. Interest Income in 2020 was lower due to decreases in interest income from the Company’s construction reserve funds deposits which were substantially lower offset by increased income due to interest earned on loans and advances to Joint Ventures. Interest income in 2019 was higher due to loans and advances to Joint Ventures.
Interest expense. Interest expense was higher in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the debt acquired in connection with the Company’s acquisition 100% of SEACOR Offshore Delta (f/k/a SEACOSCO), and partially offset due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt and payments of principal on outstanding debt. Interest expense was higher in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher interest rates early in the year, and interest for the financing of the vessel SEACOR Alps following its delivery.
SEACOR Holdings guarantee fees. As of December 31, 2020, SEACOR Holdings had issued guarantees in respect of certain of the Company’s obligations with a value of $7.0 million. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement executed in connection with the Spin-off, SEACOR Holdings charges the Company a guarantee fee of 0.5% per annum on the amount of outstanding guarantees. See “Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments.”
Loss on debt extinguishment. On September 26, 2018, the Company entered into a $130.0 million loan facility with a syndicate of lenders administered by DNB Bank ASA. A portion of the proceeds ($99.9 million) was used towards the extinguishment of prior term loans. (See “Note 8. Long-Term Debt” in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). As a result of this transaction, the Company recognized a loss of $0.6 million in fees related to the extinguishment of debt.
Derivative gains, net. For all periods, derivative gains were primarily due to reductions in the fair value of the Company’s conversion option liability on its Convertible Senior Notes. The reductions in the conversion option liability were primarily the result of declines in the Company’s share price and estimated credit spread.
Foreign currency losses, net. Foreign currency losses in 2020 were lower primarily due to the strengthening of the pound sterling and the euro in relation to the U.S. Dollar.
Income Tax Benefit
For the year ending December 31, 2020, the Company’s effective income tax rate of 23.4% was primarily due to income tax benefits recognized as a result of the CARES Act signed into law in March 2020, as well as taxes provided on income attributable to noncontrolling interests, foreign sourced income not subject to U.S. income taxes, foreign taxes not creditable against U.S. income taxes, and the adjustment for the acquisition of the remaining minority membership interest in Falcon Global Holdings.
For the year ended December 31, 2019 the Company’s effective income tax rate of 9.4% was lower than the Company’s statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to foreign subsidiaries with current losses for which there is no current or future federal income tax benefit.
Upon comparison of the 2018 consolidated federal tax return to the 2018 year-end tax provision, the Company recorded a return to provision adjustment related to losses from a consolidated joint venture of $2.4 million in 2019.
For 2018 the Company incurred a current tax liability of $1.4 million related to the non-qualified withdrawal of funds from a Capital Construction Fund by a partnership in which the Company held a 50% interest. The Company had previously recorded a deferred tax liability in connection with this fund.
Equity in (Losses) Earnings of 50% or Less Owned Companies, Net of Tax
For the years ended December 31, the Company’s equity in earnings (losses) from continuing operations of 50% or less owned companies, net of tax, was as follows (in thousands):
2020 compared with 2019
MexMar. Equity earnings from MexMar decreased by $5.1 million as compared to 2019 due to an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts due to a default on a loan agreement with UP Offshore (Bahamas) Ltd (“UP Offshore”), a wholly owned subsidiary of MEXMAR Offshore.
MEXMAR Offshore. Equity losses from MEXMAR Offshore increased by $4.9 million due to losses in the value of the investment.
Offshore Vessel Holdings (“OVH”). Equity losses increased by $3.2 million due to higher maintenance and repair costs, depreciation and amortization primarily due to the addition of vessels operated under financial leases and increasing financial and other expenses.
OSV Partners. Equity losses from SEACOR OSV Partners GP LLC and SEACOR OSV Partners I LP LLC (collectively, “OSV Partners”) increased by less than $0.1 million, primarily due to utilization.
SEACOR Grant DIS. Change in equity earnings from SEACOR Grant DIS LLC (“SEACOR Grant DIS”) was due to the joint venture dissolution in 2019.
Dynamic Offshore Drilling. The investment in Dynamic Offshore Drilling Limited (“Dynamic Offshore Drilling”) was fully impaired in 2019.
SEACOR Offshore Delta (f/k/a SEACOSCO). The decrease of $5.4 million in equity losses from SEACOR Offshore Delta LLC (“SEACOR Offshore Delta”) was primarily due to the acquisition of and consolidation of the joint venture in July 2020.
SEACOR Marine Arabia. The increase of $2.3 million in equity gains from SEACOR Marine Arabia was due to increased revenues and recording of a true-up of fees related to the management agreement with our joint venture partner of $0.9 million recognized in 2020.
2019 compared with 2018
MexMar. Equity earnings from MexMar decreased by $1.7 million as compared to 2018 due to lower utilization.
MEXMAR Offshore. Equity losses from MEXMAR Offshore increased by $4.9 million due to losses in the value of the investment.
Offshore Vessel Holdings (“OVH”). On December 28, 2018, the Company invested $4.9 million for a 49% interest in OVH. The remaining 51% is owned by a subsidiary of CME. OVH invests in offshore assets and charters marine equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2019 OVH loaned $10.0 million to Operadora Productura Mexsicana, a drilling company in Mexico which owns and operates two jackup drilling rigs “OPM”, chartered in three PSV’s from UP Offshore and purchased one FSV from the Company for $2.4 million through a seller’s finance agreement.
OSV Partners. Equity losses from OSV Partners were $0.6 million lower than 2018 primarily due to an increased utilization in 2019.
SEACOR Grant DIS. Change in equity earnings from SEACOR Grant DIS LLC was due to $1.1 million loss from operations in 2018 and $0.4 million gain resulting from a release of capital call liability due to the joint venture dissolution in 2019.
Dynamic Offshore Drilling. Equity losses were reduced by $0.4 million due to decreased interest expense. The investment was fully impaired in 2019.
SEACOR Offshore Delta (f/k/a “SEACOSCO”). The increase of $4.8 million in equity losses from SEACOR Offshore Delta was primarily due to operating expenses associated with the additional new vessels entering service in the joint venture.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
General
The Company’s ongoing liquidity requirements arise primarily from working capital needs, capital commitments and its obligations to service outstanding debt and comply with covenants under its debt facilities. The Company may use its liquidity to fund capital expenditures, make acquisitions or to make other investments. Sources of liquidity are cash balances, marketable securities, construction reserve funds and cash flows from operations. From time to time, the Company may secure additional liquidity through asset sales or the issuance of debt, shares of Common Stock or common stock of its subsidiaries, preferred stock or a combination thereof.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s unfunded capital commitments from continuing operations were $11.7 million for one PSV and miscellaneous vessel equipment. Of the unfunded capital commitments, $10.7 million is payable during 2021 and $1.0 million is payable during 2022. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had indefinitely deferred an additional $9.6 million of orders with respect to one FSV that the Company had previously reported unfunded capital commitments.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had outstanding debt of $472.9 million, net of debt discount and issue costs. The Company’s contractual long-term debt maturities as of December 31, 2020 are as follows (in thousands):
As of December 31, 2020, the Company held balances of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and construction reserve funds totaling $36.0 million, of which $4.2 million was construction reserve funds held as cash. In January 2021, the Company received cash proceeds of $42.6 million for the sale of Windcat Workboats. In addition, as a result of the CARES Act and the entry into the Tax Refund Agreement, the Company expects to receive cash tax refunds of approximately $31.2 million within the next 12 months, subject to the refund schedule of the IRS. The IRS has been recently experiencing delays in processing refund claims due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. These tax refunds are subject to the terms of the Tax Refund Agreement, which does not restrict the use of approximately $23.1 million of the refund, with the remaining $8.1 million required to be deposited into an account to be used to satisfy certain of the Company’s obligations that remain guaranteed by SEACOR Holdings.
For the years ended December 31, the following is a summary of the Company’s cash flows (in thousands):
Operating Activities
Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased by $31.4 million in 2020 compared with 2019. For the years ended December 31, the components of cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities were as follows (in thousands):
(1)
During 2020, 2019 and 2018, capitalized interest paid and included in purchases of property and equipment was $0.9 million, $1.5 million, and $2.4 million, respectively.
For a detailed discussion of the Company’s financial results for the reported periods, see “Consolidated Results of Operations” included above. Changes in operating assets and liabilities before interest and income taxes are the result of the Company’s working capital requirements.

Short and Long-Term Liquidity Requirements
The Company believes that a combination of cash balances on hand, construction reserve funds, cash generated from operating activities, availability under existing subsidiary financing arrangements and access to the credit and capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations, including to support its capital expenditures program, working capital and debt service requirements. The Company continually evaluates possible acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses and assets. The Company’s sources of liquidity may be impacted by the general condition of the markets in which it operates and the broader economy as a whole, which may limit its access to the credit and capital markets on acceptable terms. Management will continue to closely monitor the Company’s liquidity and compliance with covenants in its credit facilities specifically as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic. As noted above under “Overview”, there are a number of steps the Company has and can take to mitigate any further adverse effects to the Company’s liquidity stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting depressed oil and natural gas price environment, including sales of assets, workforce reduction and other cost reduction measures. In addition, the Company expects to receive a meaningful amount of tax refunds over the next 12 months as a result of the changes in the current U.S. tax law included in the CARES Act. While the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced the demand for the Company’s products and services, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on the Company’s liquidity or, except as noted in “Note 8. Long-Term Debt” in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, on the Company’s ability to meet its financial maintenance covenants in its various credit facilities. However, the Company's primary credit facility requires the Company to maintain a minimum of $35.0 million of cash on hand (including restricted cash) at all times. As of December 31, 2020 the Company's cash balances used to test compliance with this covenant was $36.0 million and the Company expects its cash on hand (including proceeds received from the sale of Windcat Workboats described below, together with its cash flow from operations and tax refunds the Company expects to receive (as described under “Recent Developments - Tax Refund Agreement” which would be included in the covenant calculation) will be sufficient to maintain compliance with this covenant for the foreseeable future. However, if the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business becomes more severe, for example by further reducing the demand for the Company’s products and services or causing customers not to make their payments on time, or the
Company does not receive its expected tax refunds in a timely manner, the Company may be required to seek amendments to the covenant to avoid a default under the facility.
The Company completed the sale of Windcat Workboats on January 12, 2021 to Compagnie Maritime Belge (“CMB”), and as consideration for the sale, the Company received £32.8 million in cash and CMB assumed all of the approximately £20.4 million of debt outstanding under Windcat’s existing revolving credit facility. After deducting transaction costs and expenses and giving effect to foreign exchange rate hedges, the Company received net cash proceeds of approximately $42.6 million. The net cash proceeds received in the sale of Windcat adds to the Company’s cash on hand and further supports covenant compliance and the operational and financing needs of the Company.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any obligations on behalf of 50% or less owned companies or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special-purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.
Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments
Prior to the Spin-Off, in the ordinary course of business, SEACOR Holdings issued guarantees in respect of certain of the Company’s obligations, including obligations under debt instruments and credit facilities, sale-leaseback transactions, letters of credit and certain invoiced amounts for funding deficits of a multi-employer defined benefit pension plan. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of obligations that SEACOR Holdings had guaranteed on the Company’s behalf was $7.0 million. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement entered into with SEACOR Holdings in connection with the Spin-off, the Company is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause SEACOR Holdings to be released from these guarantees in favor of a guarantee issued by the Company. To the extent the Company is unable to cause SEACOR Holdings to be released from any of these guarantees under reasonable terms, the Company pays SEACOR Holdings a guarantee fee equal to 0.5% per annum of the amount of outstanding guarantees, which declines as the guarantee obligations are settled by the Company. The Company recognized guarantee fees in connection with sale-leaseback arrangements of $0.1 million, $0.2 million, and $0.3 million during 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, as additional leased-in equipment operating expenses. Guarantee fees paid to SEACOR Holdings for all other obligations are recognized as SEACOR Holdings guarantee fees. The Company indemnifies SEACOR Holdings in respect of any payments that SEACOR Holdings is required to make under any of these guarantees.
The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments and their aggregate maturities as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):
(1)
Estimated interest payments of the Company’s borrowings are based on contractual terms and maturities, using current rates for variable instruments.
(2)
Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the purchase of property and equipment.
(3)
Operating leases primarily include leases of vessels and other property that have a remaining term in excess of one year.
(4)
Financing leases includes equipment that has a remaining term in excess of one year.
(5)
These commitments are for goods and services to be acquired in the ordinary course of business and are fulfilled by the Company’s vendors within a short period of time.
Debt Securities and Credit Agreements
For a discussion of the Company’s debt securities and credit agreements, see “Note 8. Long-Term Debt” in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Effects of Inflation
The Company’s operations expose it to the effects of inflation. In the event that inflation becomes a significant factor in the world economy, inflationary pressures could result in increased operating and financing costs.
Contingencies
MNOPF and MNRPF. Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries are participating employers in two industry-wide, multi-employer, defined benefit pension funds in the U.K.: the MNOPF and the MNRPF.
The Company’s participation in the MNOPF began with the acquisition of the Stirling group of companies (the “Stirling Group”) in 2001 and relates to certain officers employed between 1978 and 2002 by the Stirling Group and/or its predecessors. The Company’s participation in the MNRPF also began with the acquisition of the Stirling Group in 2001 and relates to ratings employed by the Stirling Group and/or its predecessors through today. Both of these plans are in deficit positions and, depending upon the results of future actuarial valuations, it is possible that the plans could experience funding deficits that will require the Company to recognize payroll related operating expenses in the periods invoices are received.
Under the direction of a court order, any funding deficit of the MNOPF is to be remedied through funding contributions from all participating current and former employers. Prior to 2015, the Company was invoiced and expensed $19.4 million for its allocated share of the then cumulative funding deficits, including portions deemed uncollectible due to the non-existence or liquidation of certain former employers. As of December 31, 2020, all amounts invoiced have been paid in full.
On November 7, 2018, the Company received notice from MNOPF that a deficit of £9 million existed but noted that the trustee did not propose to collect any additional funds in respect of such deficit. Depending on the results of future valuations, it is possible that the MNOPF will experience further funding deficits requiring the Company to recognize payroll related expenses in the periods the notice is received.
The cumulative funding deficits of the MNRPF were being recovered by additional annual contributions from current employers that were subject to adjustment following the results of future tri-annual actuarial valuations. In 2015, the Company was invoiced and expensed $6.9 million for its share of a funding deficit in the MNRPF. The Company had a repayment plan with the trustees of the MNRPF, for the amount to be repaid in four installments, commencing in 2015, and the amount was repaid in full during 2018. On July 20, 2018, the Company was notified of additional contributions due and recognized in the second quarter of 2018 payroll related expenses of $1.2 million (£0.9 million) for its allocated share of the cumulative funding deficit including portions deemed uncollectible due to the non-existence or liquidation of certain former employers. These additional contributions were invoiced in September 2018 and are payable in four annual installments beginning in October 2018. As of December 31, 2020, all invoices related to the MNRPF have been settled in full. Depending upon the results of future actuarial valuations it is possible that the plan could experience further funding deficits that will require the Company to recognize payroll related operating expenses for those periods.
Other. In the normal course of its business, the Company becomes involved in various litigation matters including, among other things, claims by third-parties for alleged property damages and personal injuries. Management has used estimates in determining its potential exposure to these matters and has recorded reserves in the Company’s financial statements related thereto as appropriate. It is possible that a change in the Company’s estimates related to these exposures could occur, but the Company does not expect such changes in estimated costs would have a material effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Related Party Transactions
For a discussion of the Company’s transactions with related parties, see “Note 17. Related Party Transactions” in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Critical Accounting Policies
Basis of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SEACOR Marine and its controlled subsidiaries. Control is generally deemed to exist if the Company has greater than 50% of the voting rights of a subsidiary. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries are included in the consolidated balance sheets as a separate component of equity. The Company reports consolidated net income (loss) inclusive of both the Company’s and the noncontrolling interests' share, as well as the amounts of consolidated net income (loss) attributable to each of the Company and the noncontrolling interests. If a subsidiary is deconsolidated upon a change in control, any retained noncontrolled equity investment in the former controlled subsidiary is measured at fair value and a gain or loss is recognized in net income (loss) based on such fair value. If a subsidiary is consolidated upon a change in control, any previous noncontrolled equity investment in the subsidiary is measured at fair value and a gain or loss is recognized in net income (loss) based on such fair value.
The Company employs the equity method of accounting for investments in 50% or less owned companies that it does not control but has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the business venture. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the Company has between 20% and 50% of the voting rights of a business venture but may exist when the Company’s ownership percentage is less than 20%. In certain circumstances, the Company may have an economic interest in excess of 50% but may not control and consolidate the business venture. Conversely, the Company may have an economic interest less than 50% but may control and consolidate the business venture. The Company reports its investments in and advances to these business ventures in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as investments, at equity, and advances to 50% or less owned companies. The Company reports its share of earnings from investments in 50% or less owned companies in the accompanying consolidated statements of loss as equity in earnings (losses) of 50% or less owned companies, net of tax.
Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include those related to deferred revenues, allowance for credit losses, useful lives of property and equipment, impairments, income tax provisions and certain accrued liabilities. Actual results could differ from estimates and those differences may be material.
Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized when (or as) the Company transfers promised goods or services to its customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services, which occurs when (or as) the Company satisfies its contractual obligations and transfers control of the promised goods or services to its customers. Costs to obtain or fulfill a contract are expensed as incurred.
The Company’s lease revenues are primarily from time charters and bareboat charters that are recognized ratably over the lease term as services are provided, typically on a per day basis. Under a time charter, the Company provides a vessel to a customer for a set term and is responsible for all operating expenses, typically excluding fuel. Under a bareboat charter, the Company provides a vessel to a customer for a set term and the customer assumes responsibility.
The Company contracts with various customers to carry out management services for vessels as agents for and on behalf of ship owners. These services include crew management, technical management, commercial management, insurance arrangements, sale and purchase of vessels, provisions and bunkering. As the manager of the vessels, the Company undertakes to use its best endeavors to provide the agreed management services as agents for and on behalf of the owners in accordance with sound ship management practice and to protect and promote the interest of the owners in all matters relating to the provision of services hereunder. The Company also contracts with various customers to carry out management services regarding engineering for vessel construction and vessel conversions. The vast majority of the ship management agreements span over the length of one to three years and are typically billed on a monthly basis. The Company transfers control of the service to the customer and satisfies its performance obligation over the term of the contract, and therefore recognized revenue over the term of the contract while related costs are expensed as incurred.
Concentrations of Credit Risk. The Company is exposed to concentrations of credit risk associated with its cash and cash equivalents, construction reserve funds and derivative instruments. The Company minimizes its credit risk relating to these positions by monitoring the financial condition of the financial institutions and counterparties involved and by primarily conducting business with large, well-established financial institutions and diversifying its counterparties. The Company does not currently anticipate nonperformance by any of its significant counterparties. The Company is also exposed to concentrations of credit risk relating to its receivables due from customers described above. The Company does not generally require collateral or other security to support its outstanding receivables. The Company minimizes its credit risk relating to receivables by performing ongoing credit evaluations and, to date, credit losses have not been material.
Trade and Other Receivables. Customers are primarily major integrated national and international oil companies and large independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. Customers are granted credit on a short-term basis and related credit risks are minimal. Other receivables consist primarily of operating expenses incurred by the Company related to vessels it manages for others and insurance and income tax receivables. The Company routinely reviews its receivables and makes provisions for credit losses; however, those allowances are estimates and actual results could differ from those estimates and those differences may be material. Trade receivables are deemed uncollectible and removed from accounts receivable and the allowance for credit losses when collection efforts have been exhausted.
Property and Equipment. Equipment, stated at cost, is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset to an estimated salvage value. With respect to offshore support vessels, the estimated useful life is typically based upon a newly built vessel being placed into service and represents the point at which it is typically not justifiable for the Company to continue to operate the vessel in the same or similar manner. From time to time, the Company may acquire older vessels that have already exceeded its useful life policy, in which case the Company depreciates such vessels based on its best estimate of remaining useful life, typically the next regulatory survey or certification date.
As of December 31, 2020, the estimated useful life (in years) of each of the Company’s major categories of new offshore support vessels was as follows:
Equipment maintenance and repair costs and the costs of routine overhauls, drydockings and inspections performed on vessels and equipment are charged to operating expense as incurred. Expenditures that extend the useful life or improve the marketing and commercial characteristics of vessels, as well as major renewals and improvements to other properties, are capitalized.
Certain interest costs incurred during the construction of vessels are capitalized as part of the vessels’ carrying values and are amortized over such vessels’ estimated useful lives.
Business Combinations. The Company recognizes 100% of the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity. Shares issued in consideration for a business combination, contingent consideration arrangements and pre-acquisition loss and gain contingencies are all measured and recorded at their acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes to fair value of contingent consideration arrangements are generally reflected in earnings. Acquisition-related transaction costs are expensed as incurred and any changes in an acquirer’s existing income tax valuation allowances and tax uncertainty accruals are recorded as an adjustment to income tax expense. The operating results of entities acquired are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of loss from the date of acquisition.
Income Taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been provided in recognition of the income tax effect attributable to the book and tax basis differences of assets and liabilities reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are provided using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which they are expected to be settled or realized. Interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions are recognized in interest expense and administrative and general, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated statements of loss. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Prior to 2017, SEACOR Marine was included in the consolidated U.S. federal income tax return of SEACOR Holdings. SEACOR Holdings’ policy for allocation of U.S. federal income taxes required its domestic subsidiaries included in the consolidated U.S. federal income tax return to compute their provision for U.S. federal income taxes on a separate company basis and settle with SEACOR Holdings.
In the normal course of business, the Company or SEACOR Holdings may be subject to challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due for the Company. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions. As part of the calculation of income tax expense, the Company determines whether the benefits of its tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained, the Company accrues the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of its tax benefits and actual results could vary materially from these estimates.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Derivative Instruments. The Company accounts for derivatives through the use of a fair value concept whereby all of the Company’s derivative positions are stated at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges are reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of loss as derivative gains (losses), net. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized as corresponding increases or decreases in the fair value of the underlying hedged item to the extent they are effective, with any ineffective portion reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of loss as derivative gains (losses), net. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are reported as a component of other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive loss to the extent they are effective and reclassified into earnings on the same line item associated with the hedged transaction and in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of loss as derivative gains (losses), net. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that are entered into by the Company’s 50% or less owned companies are also reported as a component of the Company’s other comprehensive loss in proportion to the Company’s ownership percentage, with reclassifications and ineffective portions being included in equity in earnings (losses) of 50% or less owned companies, net of tax, in the accompanying consolidated statements of loss.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. The Company performs an impairment analysis of long-lived assets used in operations, including intangible assets, when indicators of impairment are present. These indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group. If the carrying values of the assets are not recoverable, as determined by their estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the estimated fair value of the assets or asset groups are compared to their current carrying values and impairment charges are recorded if the carrying value exceeds fair value. The Company performs its testing on an asset or asset group basis. Generally, fair value is determined using valuation techniques, such as expected discounted cash flows or appraisals, as appropriate.
Impairment of 50% or Less Owned Companies. Investments in 50% or less owned companies are reviewed periodically to assess whether there is an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of the investment. In its evaluation, the Company considers, among other items, recent and expected financial performance and returns, impairments recorded by the investee and the capital structure of the investee. When the Company determines the estimated fair value of an investment is below carrying value and the decline is other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to its estimated fair value. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the uncertainty regarding projected financial performance, the severity and expected duration of declines in value, and the available liquidity in the capital markets to support the continuing operations of the investee, among other factors. Although the Company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable, the investee’s actual performance compared with the estimates could produce different results and lead to additional impairment charges in future periods.
