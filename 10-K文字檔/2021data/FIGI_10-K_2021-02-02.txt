COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) as a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the U.S. COVID-19 is having an unprecedented impact on the U.S economy as federal, state, and local governments react to this public health crisis.
The impacts of the current COVID-19 pandemic are broad reaching and the impacts on the Company’s licensing royalty interests is to date unknown. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, there is significant uncertainty surrounding the potential impact on the Company’s future results of operations and cash flows and its ability to raise capital. While we believe we are well positioned in the marketplace to navigate difficult market conditions in times of economic uncertainty, we believe continued impacts of the pandemic could materially adversely affect our Company’s near-term and long-term revenues, earnings, liquidity, and cash flows as the Company’s customers and /or licensees may request temporary relief, delay or not make scheduled payments on their royalty commitments.
During the year ended October 31, 2020, the Company received two economic injury disaster loan grants in the amount of $1,500 and $5,000. These amounts are included in other income for the year ended October 31, 2020.
Background Overview
We are engaged in the business of acquiring, holding and managing royalty interests derived from Internet based businesses. Royalty interests are passive (non-operating) agreements that provide us with contractual rights to revenue produced from our operators. The revenue generated by our operators is typically from physical or digital product sales, subscriptions and advertising.
Our purchase of royalty interests enables entrepreneurs to raise non-dilutive capital and retain control of their businesses. When we enter into royalty interest agreements, our primary objectives are to generate revenue streams from our operators and increase our corporate cash flow. In some cases, we may also generate a premium on our original purchase price if a royalty interest is redeemed by an operator or third-party such as a buyer of an operator. We plan to acquire royalty interests that can generate a 15% to 30% internal rate of return, although there can be no guarantee that we will achieve this target.
Royalty interests are purchased for a fixed amount of capital in exchange for pre-determined royalty payments. Depending on the unique agreement, (i) royalty payments can be made monthly, quarterly or annually, (ii) royalty payments can be made in perpetuity or for a limited amount of time, (iii) royalty payment calculations can change during the term of the royalty interest agreement based on certain performance metrics or time and (iv) royalty payments can be calculated off gross revenue of each operator, or off net-revenue, which accounts for certain defined adjustments to gross revenue, or off unit sales. Although we presently do not have a plan in place to do so now, we may issue shares of our Company common stock to operators, in addition to the payment of cash, in exchange for royalty payments from the operator.
We primarily intend to negotiate royalty interests directly from operators, but we may also acquire existing royalty interests from third parties. A key element of our business model is the building of a diversified portfolio of high-quality royalty interests from Internet based businesses.
We use a series of quantitative, qualitative, financial, and legal criteria by which we evaluate the potential acquisition of royalty interests. We plan to acquire assets with an income focus, and our target is to acquire assets generating uncorrelated income of 15% to 30% internal rate of return, although there can be no guarantee that we will achieve this target. Among the factors considered are: (1) the business track record of revenue and earnings; (2) the type of business that generates royalties; (3) the experience and skill of the active management team of the business; (4) our assessment of the longevity and staying power of the underlying business; and (5) the potential for revenue growth and capital appreciation.
We currently, and generally at any time, have royalty interest acquisition opportunities in various stages of active review. At this time, we cannot provide assurance that any of the possible transactions under review by us will be concluded successfully.

Estimated payments of 5% of the value of the $180,000 paid for the royalty interest are due no later than the 5th day of the month following the calendar quarter. The estimates are then compared to the actual and trued up on our Company’s invoice. We recognized $18,250 in revenue during the year ended October 31, 2020.

The primary reasons for the increase were from the amortization of royalty interests of $54,792, increase in salaries and wages of $75,830, increase in consulting and professional expenses of $87,556 related to the filing and acceptance of the S-1 filed with the SEC earlier in 2020, and investment in our advertising and marketing of $32,302 related to development of our website and other general marketing costs.

The Operator closed its operations, therefore, we determined that we would not recognize any future benefit from the royalty acquired.
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) as a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the U.S. COVID-19 is having an unprecedented impact on the U.S economy as federal, state, and local governments react to this public health crisis.

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, there is significant uncertainty surrounding the potential impact on the Company’s future results of operations and cash flows and its ability to raise capital. Continued impacts of the pandemic could materially
adversely affect the Company’s near-term and long-term revenues, earnings, liquidity, and cash flows as the Company’s customers and/or licensees may request temporary relief, delay or not make scheduled payments on their royalty commitments.

From inception through October 31, 2019, the Company used $167,596 of cash in operating activities. Our primary source of cash outflows include payroll, accounting services, audit services, legal services, regulatory expense and consulting services. Cash outflows typically occur in close proximity of expense recognition.
Sources and Uses of Cash
For the year ended October 2020 and for the period from November 15, 2018 to October 31, 2019, the Company invested $430,000 and $495,675 in the acquisition of royalty interests.
For the year ended October 31, 2020, the Company raised $520,300 in financing of which $509,000 was received through the private placement offering of 848.34 units.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our critical accounting policies and estimates, including the assumptions and judgments underlying them, are disclosed in the Notes to the Financial Statements. We have consistently applied these policies in all material respects. We do not believe that our operations to date have involved uncertainty of accounting treatment, subjective judgment, or estimates, to any significant degree, except as noted below and it is unlikely that material different amounts would be reported under different assumptions.
Royalty Interests
We have a total of $730,675 invested in royalty interests. Royalty interests are passive (non-operating) agreements that provide us with contractual rights to a percentage of revenue produced from companies we provide funds to. We adopted the policy of amortizing the cost of royalty interests using the straight-line method over a period of 15 years. Royalty interests are considered a long-lived asset that is required to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment exists for the royalty interests if the carrying amount exceeds the estimates of future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such assets. An impairment charge is required to be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset, or asset group, exceeds its fair value.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue under royalty interest agreements when earned and collection is reasonably assured.
We recognized revenue from royalty interest agreements under ASC 606-10-55-65 which apply to sales-based or Usage-Based royalties. Guidance under this section stipulates that revenue recognition should be based when the later of the following events occur: (1) the subsequent sales occur or (2) the performance obligation to which some or all for the sales-based royalty has been allocated has been satisfied or partially satisfied. The Company deems collection efforts to be the key performance obligation being satisfied, and therefore has adopted the approach of recognizing revenue based on customer collections. The operators that are parties to the royalty agreements, are typically structured to report and pay percentages of revenue earned over a quarterly period, some of which do not line up with the quarterly reporting period of the Company.
Contractual Obligations
SAFE Agreements
The Company has a Simple Agreement for Future Equity program ("SAFE"). This SAFE is one of a series of simple agreements for future equity (collectively, the "Series 1 SAFEs") issued by the Company to investors with identical terms and on the same form, except that the holder, purchase price and date of issuance may differ in each SAFE. Pursuant to the definitions of the Series 1 SAFEs, as amended, the price per share of the Next Equity Financing minus a discount of 45% will be the conversion price. The conversion price will be subject to a Valuation Cap of $15 million. As of October 31, 2019, SAFE convertible contributions amounted to $1,812,000.
As of October 31, 2020, these SAFE agreements converted into 1,647,273 shares of common stock subscribed at the contractual discounted price of $1.10 per share.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
New Accounting Pronouncements
We do not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flow.
