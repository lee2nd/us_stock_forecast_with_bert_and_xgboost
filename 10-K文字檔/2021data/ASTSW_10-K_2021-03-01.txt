ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the notes related thereto which are included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on May 28, 2019 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar Business Combination with one or more businesses. We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.
As indicated in the accompanying financial statements, at December 31, 2020, we had $131,151 in cash and working capital deficit of $337,484, which excludes prepaid income taxes and franchise taxes payable as the net amounts can be paid from the interest earned in the trust account. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete our initial Business Combination will be successful.
Recent Developments
On December 15, 2020, we entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement with the sponsor, AST, Abel Avellan, and the Existing Equityholders. Pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement, following the closing, we will be organized in an Up-C structure, in which substantially all of the assets of the combined company will be held by AST, and our only assets will be our equity interests in AST. The AST Business Combination will be consummated subject to certain conditions as further described in the Equity Purchase Agreement.
On January 28, 2021 and on February 18, 2021, the sponsor agreed to loan the Company $200,000 and $500,000 for an aggregate of $700,000, respectively. The promissory notes are provided to cover certain expenses related to the Business Combination pursuant to a promissory note (the “Note”). The Note is non-interest bearing, non-convertible and payable on the earlier of (i) June 30, 2021 or (ii) the completion of the Business Combination. As of February 26, 2021, the Company had borrowed $300,000 under the promissory notes.
Results of Operations
We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities December 31, 2020 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for our initial public offering, described below, and, after our initial public offering, identifying a target company for a Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the trust account. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had net income of $191,177, which consisted of interest income on marketable securities held in the trust account of $1,479,986 and an unrealized gain on marketable securities held in our trust account of $1,830, offset by operating costs of $1,124,693 and a provision for income taxes of $165,946.
For the period from May 28, 2019 (inception) through December 31, 2019, we had net income of $655,679, which consisted of interest income on marketable securities held in the trust account of $1,197,637 and an unrealized gain on marketable securities held in our trust account of $17,194, offset by operating and formation costs of $384,857 and a provision for income taxes of $174,295.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
On September 13, 2019, we consummated our initial public offering of 20,000,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $200,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, we consummated the sale of 5,500,000 private placement warrants to the sponsor at a price of $1.00 per warrant, generating gross proceeds of $5,500,000.
On September 19, 2019, in connection with the underwriters’ full exercise of their over-allotment option, we consummated the sale of an additional 3,000,000 units and the sale of an additional 600,000 private placement warrants, generating total gross proceeds of $30,600,000.
Following our initial public offering, the exercise of the over-allotment option and the sale of the private placement warrants, a total of $230,000,000 was placed in the trust account. We incurred $13,260,927 in transaction costs, including $4,600,000 of underwriting fees, $8,050,000 of deferred underwriting fees and $610,927 of other costs.
As of December 31, 2020, we had marketable securities held in the trust account of $232,196,027 (including $2,196,027 of interest income and unrealized gains) consisting of U.S. Treasury Bills with a maturity of 185 days or less. Interest income on the balance in the trust account may be used by us to pay taxes. For year ended December 31, 2020, we withdraw $500,620 of interest earned on the trust account to pay our franchise and income taxes.
For year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in operating activities was $862,597. Net income of $191,177 was affected by interest earned on marketable securities held in the trust account of $1,479,986, an unrealized gain on marketable securities held in our trust account of $1,830, a deferred tax provision of $6,069 and changes in operating assets and liabilities, which provided $421,973 of cash.
For the period from May 28, 2019 (inception) through December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $420,945. Net income of $655,679 was affected by interest earned on marketable securities held in the trust account of $1,197,637, an unrealized gain on marketable securities held in our trust account of $17,194, a deferred tax provision of $3,611 and changes in operating assets and liabilities, which provided $134,596 of cash.
We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account (less deferred underwriting commissions and income taxes payable), to complete our Business Combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.
In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the initial stockholders or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants identical to the private placement warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender.
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash of $131,151 held outside of the trust account and working capital deficit of $337,484. Until the consummation of a Business Combination, we will be using the funds not held in the trust account for primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates are not under any obligation to advance us funds, or to invest in us. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain additional financing. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses. We cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020.
Contractual Obligations
We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay an affiliate of the sponsor a monthly fee of $10,000 for office space, administrative and support services to the Company. We began incurring these fees on September 11, 2019 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the Business Combination and the Company’s liquidation.
The underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of $0.35 per unit, or $8,050,000 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the trust account solely in the event that we complete a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies:
Class A Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption
We account for our Class A common stock subject to possible conversion in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Shares of Class A common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. Our Class A common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, Class A common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets.
Net Income Per Common Share
We apply the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Shares of common stock subject to possible redemption, which are not currently redeemable and are not redeemable at fair value, have been excluded from the calculation of basic net loss per common share since such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of the trust account earnings. Our net income is adjusted for the portion of income that is attributable to common stock subject to possible redemption, as these shares only participate in the earnings of the trust account and not our income or losses.
Recent Accounting Standards
Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements.
