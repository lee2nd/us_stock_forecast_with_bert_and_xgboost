Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This section is intended to help investors understand the financial performance of HV Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiary through a discussion of the factors affecting our financial condition as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, the six month transition period ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended June 30, 2019. This section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to the audited consolidated financial statements that appear beginning on page 61 of this annual report.
Overview
HV Bancorp, Inc. provides financial services to individuals and businesses from our main office in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, and from our three additional full-service banking offices located in Plumsteadville, Warrington and Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania. We also operate a limited service branch in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Our administrative offices and executive offices are located in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. Our Business Banking office is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We have loan production and sales offices located in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, Doylestown, Pennsylvania, Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania and Wilmington, Delaware; and a loan origination office in Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania. Our primary market area includes Montgomery, Bucks and Philadelphia Counties in Pennsylvania, Burlington County in New Jersey and New Castle County in Delaware. Our principal business consists of attracting retail deposits from the general public in our market area and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, primarily in one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans (including multi-family loans), home equity loans and lines of credit and, to a lesser extent, consumer loans and construction loans. We retain our loans in portfolio depending on market conditions, but we primarily sell our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. We also invest in various investment securities. Our revenue is derived principally from interest on loans and investments and loan sales. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (“PPPLF”), Federal Home Loan Bank advances and principal and interest payments on loans and securities.
Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our results of operations also are affected by our provision for loan losses, non-interest income and non-interest expense. Non-interest income currently consists primarily of gains recognized from the sale of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market, fees for customer services, gain (loss) from derivative instruments and sales of securities. Non-interest expense currently consists primarily of expenses related to salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, data processing related operations, professional fees and other expenses. Our results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities.
Business Strategy
In March 2020, the World Health Organization recognized the outbreak of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. From the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, our focus has been and remains on navigating the complexities, impact and ongoing challenges of the pandemic. During March 2020, management launched its previously developed Business Continuity Plan in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, the Company implemented drive-up service only, increased the use of virtual and distance communications with customers and employees, and mandated expansive work at home procedures for employees. By end of June 2020, our employees began returning to their offices on a rotating basis and the branch lobby services have been reopened to accommodate customers’ needs. This gradual process was met with close adherence to health and safety-related requirements. We will continue to monitor governmental guidelines and follow mandates as set by authorities.
The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected economic activity globally, nationally and locally. It has caused substantial disruption in international and U.S. economies, markets, and employment. The full impact of COVID-19 remains uncertain. Despite these unprecedented health and economic challenges, the Company remains acutely focused on the execution of our strategic plan that began in 2017, with the conversion of a mutual to a stock bank.
We intend to operate as a well-capitalized and profitable community bank dedicated to providing exceptional personal service to our consumer and business customers. We believe that we have a competitive advantage in the markets we serve because of our knowledge of the local marketplace and our long-standing history of providing superior, relationship-based customer service. Our core business strategies are to:
•
Continue to Originate and Sell Certain Residential Real Estate Loans. Residential mortgage lending has historically been a significant part of our business, and we recognize that originating one- to four-family residential real estate loans is essential to our status as a community-oriented bank. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we originated $618.1 million in one- to four-family residential real estate loans held for sale, selling $600.8 million
in one- to four-family residential real estate loans held for sale for gains on sale of $13.3 million. During the six month transition period ended December 31, 2019, we originated $167.1 million in one- to four-family residential real estate loans held for sale, selling $166.7 million in one- to four-family residential real estate loans held for sale for gains on sale of $3.6 million. During the year ended June 30, 2019, we originated $159.8 million in one- to four-family residential real estate loans held for sale, selling $140.1 million in one- to four-family residential real estate loans held for sale for gains on sale of $2.8 million We intend to continue to sell in the secondary market most of the long-term conforming fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate to increase non-interest income and manage the overall duration of our loan portfolio. We also intend to hold an appropriately sized portfolio of jumbo adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans in order to increase interest income and help manage our interest rate risk. At December 31, 2020, we had $73.8 million in jumbo one- to four-family residential real estate loans, which represented 52.0% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loan portfolio compared to $125.5 million or 63.3% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loan portfolio at December 31, 2019.
•
Increase Commercial Real Estate and Commercial business. In 2019, we established a new business banking division which will greatly expand the Bank’s commercial real estate and commercial business portfolios. The inclusion of commercial real estate and commercial business loans may increase the yield on the loan portfolio and should help reduce interest rate risk while maintaining what we believe are conservative underwriting standards.
•
Maintain High Asset Quality. Strong asset quality is critical to the long-term financial success of a community bank. We attribute our high asset quality to maintaining conservative underwriting standards, the diligence of our loan servicing personnel and the stability of the local economy. At December 31, 2020, our non-performing assets to total assets ratio was 0.71%. Because a substantial amount of our loans are secured by real estate, the level of our non-performing loans has been low in recent years as well as we adhere to a credit culture that is supported by strong underwriting standards, we believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb the probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio.
•
Maintain Level of Core Deposits. We plan to continue to market our transaction and savings accounts, emphasizing our high-quality, personalized customer service coupled with customer-facing technologies. We also offer the convenience of technology-based products, such as remote deposit capture, internet banking, mobile banking and mobile capture. Our ratio of core (non-time) deposits to total deposits was 91.5% at December 31, 2020.
Critical Accounting Policies
The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations.
On April 5, 2015, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an “emerging growth company” we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
The following represents our critical accounting policies:
Allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to income. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment.
The allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans. The allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses, and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses, and subsequent
recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. All, or part, of the principal balance of loans receivable are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all, or part, of the principal balance is highly unlikely.
The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated. Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance. The allowance is based on the Bank’s past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.
The allowance consists of specific, and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers pools of loans by loan class including commercial loans not considered impaired, as well as smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgage, home equity, home equity lines of credit and consumer loans. These pools of loans are evaluated for loss exposure based upon historical loss rates for each of these categories of loans, adjusted for qualitative factors.
These qualitative risk factors include:
•
Lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices;
•
National, regional, and local economic and business conditions as well as the condition of various market segments, including the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans;
•
Nature and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans;
•
Volume and severity of past due, classified and nonaccrual loans as well as and other loan modifications;
•
Existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations; and
•
Effect of external factors, such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements.
Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition, the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. These agencies may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would adversely affect earnings.
See Note 1 of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this annual report.
Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of the evidence available, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. See also Note 14- Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Investment Securities. Securities are evaluated on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when market conditions warrant such an evaluation, to determine whether declines in their value are other-than-temporary. To determine whether a loss in value is other-than-temporary, management utilizes criteria such as reasons underlying the decline, the magnitude and duration of the decline and whether or not management intends to sell or expects that it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security prior to an anticipated recovery of fair value. The term “other-than-temporary” is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent, but indicates that the prospects for a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment. Once a decline in value for a debt security is determined to be other-than-temporary, the other-than-temporary impairment is separated into (a) the amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to a decrease in cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security (the credit losses) and (b) the amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to other factors. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).
Fair Value Measurements. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A more detailed description of the fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy and our methodology can be found in Note 15 of the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this transition report on Form 10-K.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. We use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks primarily associated with fluctuations in interest rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes. All of our derivative instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are included in the consolidated statements of financial condition as mortgage banking derivatives and other liabilities. The fair value of our derivative instruments, other than Interest Rate Lock Commitments (“IRLC”) is determined by utilizing quoted prices from dealers in such securities or third-party models utilizing observable market inputs. The fair value of the Company’s IRLC instruments are based upon the underlying mortgage loan adjusted for the probability of such commitments being exercised and estimated costs to complete and originate the loan. The changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are included in non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income.
To be announced securities (“TBAs”) are “forward delivery” securities considered derivative instruments under derivatives and hedging accounting guidance, (FASB ASC 815). We utilize TBAs to protect against the price risk inherent in derivative loan commitments. TBAs are valued based on forward dealer marks from our approved counterparties. We utilize a third-party market pricing service, which compiles current prices for instruments from market sources and those prices represent the current executable price. TBAs are recorded at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition in mortgage derivatives and other liabilities with changes in fair value recorded in non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income.
Loan commitments that are derivatives are recognized at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition as mortgage banking derivatives and as other liabilities with changes in their fair values recorded as a gain in hedging instruments in non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income. Outstanding IRLCs are subject to interest rate risk and related price risk during the period from the date of issuance through the date of loan funding, cancellation or expiration. Loan commitments generally range between 30 and 90 days; however, the borrower is not obligated to obtain the loan. We are subject to fallout risk related to IRLCs, which is realized if approved borrowers choose not to close on the loans within the terms of the IRLCs. We have used mandatory commitments to substantially reduce these risks. See Note 11 Derivatives and Risk Management Activities in the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company in this annual report.
COVID-19 UPDATE
In April 2020, our team in business banking and retail banking began accepting and processing applications for loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) implemented by the Small Business Association (“SBA”) with support from the Department of Treasury under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). As of December 31, 2020, the Company had received over 450 applications from new and existing customers with an outstanding balance of $64.4 million and received approximately $2.3 million in processing fee income. The processing fee income is deferred and recognized over the contractual life of the loan, or accelerated if the loan is forgiven. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized approximately $528,000 in interest income related to the PPP loans. The PPP loans have a two-year term and earn interest at 1%. The SBA fully guarantees the principle and interest, unless the lender violated an obligation under the agreement. The Company did not include the PPP loans in the
allowance for loan loss calculation as loan losses, if any, are anticipated to be immaterial. Through March 22, 2021, the Company received approximately $24.9 million in PPP forgiveness from the SBA. As of March 22, 2021, the Company had processed and approved over 300 applications of the PPP program for approximately $44.1 million in the second round of PPP loans which commenced in January 2021.
In December 2020, the Company participated in the Main Street Lending Program established by the Federal Reserve to support lending to small and medium-sized for profit businesses and nonprofit organizations that were in sound financial condition before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The program ended on January 8, 2021. At December 31, 2020, the Company funded approximately $31.1 million in loans. The Company retained approximately 5% or $1.6 million outstanding balance at December 31, 2020 as 95% of the originated loans were sold to the Federal Reserve of Boston as part of the program.
Liquidity Sources
The Company has reviewed all sources of liquidity in anticipation of any potential funding needs due to the COVID-19 pandemic and prioritized based on available capacity, terms, and cost of funds. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had the following sources of liquidity available:
In addition as of December 31, 2020, the Company also had access to $3.0 million unused borrowing capacity from the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank and a $923,000 line of credit with Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The Company also has access to brokered certificate of deposits as an additional funding source.
Capital Strength
At December 31, 2020, the Bank’s exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and was considered “well capitalized” under regulatory guidelines.
•
Total risk-based capital (to risk-weighted assets) was 13.4%, tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) was 12.7%, tier 1 capital (to average assets) was 7.4%, and tier 1 common equity (to risk-weighted assets) was 12.7%.
See Footnote 10 Regulatory Capital for more information.
Deferral Requests
The Company has worked with the customers impacted by COVID-19 to provide short-term assistance up to nine months in accordance with regulatory guidelines. Commercial borrowers requesting assistance have been offered either a 90-day principal and interest deferral or a 90-day interest only with a potential deferral of up to two additional months. These deferrals do not constitute Troubled Debt Restructurings (“TDRS”) because they met the requirements under section 4013 of the CARES Act. Under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, loans less than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019, will be considered current for COVID-19 modifications. A financial institution can then use FASB agreed upon temporary changes to GAAP for loan modifications related to COVID-19 that would otherwise be categorized as a TDR, and suspend any determination of a loan modified as a result of COVID-19 being a TDR, including the requirement to determine impairment for accounting purposes. Similarly, FASB has confirmed that short-term modifications made on a good-faith basis in response to COVID-19 to loan customers who were current prior to any relief are not TDRs.
Residential borrowers needing assistance have been offered a 90-day principal and interest deferral with a potential additional 90-day deferral. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had two residential one-to-four family loan deferral requests and one commercial
real estate loan deferral request totaling $1.8 million in outstanding loans compared to 4 residential one-to-four family loan deferral requests, representing $1.8 million in total outstanding loans as of September 30, 2020 and 73 deferral requests processed with an outstanding balance of $29.0 million as of June 30, 2020.
Loan Portfolio Analysis
Certain industries such as those included in the Company’s commercial lending portfolio are anticipated to suffer greater economic impact as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The following table provides the outstanding exposure in regard to the Company’s commercial loan portfolio by type as of December 31, 2020.
The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to the Company’s loan portfolio is uncertain and cannot be predicted as it will depend on certain developments including the duration of the pandemic and its impact on the local and national economy as a whole and the response thereto.
Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019
Total Assets
Total assets increased $507.0 million, or 143.0%, to $861.6 million at December 31, 2020 from $354.6 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily the result of increases of $394.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, $58.8 million in loans receivable, $45.6 million in loans held for sale, $2.0 million in mortgage servicing rights, $1.7 million in mortgage banking derivatives and $1.7 million in right-of-use asset.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents increased $394.0 million to $414.6 million at December 31, 2020 from $20.6 million at December 31, 2019. In December 2020, the Company experienced an increase in cash as a result of an increase in retail deposits from certain accounts which it anticipates to be temporary and that a significant portion will be dispersed during the first quarter of 2021. In addition, growth in cash and cash equivalents was due to growth in public fund deposits and proceeds from use of the PPPLF facility. We anticipate that excess liquidity will be used to fund growth of the loan portfolio.
Investment Securities
Investment securities increased by $2.3 million, or 10.8% to $23.5 million at December 31, 2020 from $21.2 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to purchases of $14.8 million and an increase of $363,000 in unrealized gains on securities available-for-sale partially offset by sales and principal repayments of $12.9 million.
Net Loans
Net loans increased $58.8 million, or 23.1% to $313.8 million at December 31, 2020 from $255.0 million at December 31, 2019. In April 2020, the Company begin participating in the PPP program and processed over 450 applications with an outstanding balance of $64.4 million as of December 31, 2020. Commercial real estate loans increased by $33.5 million to $68.7 million at December 31, 2020, from $35.2 million at December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of originations from the business banking division, whose continued focus
is growth of the commercial lending and commercial business loan portfolios. Commercial business loans increased by $13.1 million to $24.2 million at December 31, 2020, from $11.1 million at December 31, 2019. The construction loans increased $6.5 million to $7.3 million at December 31, 2020, from $784,000 at December 31, 2019. Offsetting these increases was a $55.6 million decrease in one- to four-family residential real estate loans from $197.5 million at December 31, 2019, to $141.9 million at December 31, 2020, and a $390,000 decrease in home equity and HELOC loans from $4.4 million at December 31, 2019, to $4.0 million at December 31, 2020.
In November 2017, the Bank entered into a loan purchase agreement with a broker to purchase a portfolio of private education loans made to American citizens attending AMA-approved medical schools in Caribbean nations. The broker serves as a lender, holder, program designer and developer, administrator, and secondary market for the loan portfolios they generate. At December 31, 2020, the balance of the private education loans was $5.1 million. The private student loans were made following a proven credit criteria and were underwritten in accordance with the Bank’s policies. At December 31, 2020, there were, three loans with a total balance of approximately $81,000 that were past due 90 days or more.
Loans Held For Sale
Loans held for sale increased $45.6 million to $83.5 million at December 31, 2020 from $37.9 million at December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of originations of $631.8 million of one- to four-family residential real estate loans during the year ended December 31, 2020 and net of principle sales of $600.8 million of loans in the secondary market during this same period.
Deposits
Deposits increased $447.0 million, or 157.5%, to $730.8 million at December 31, 2020 from $283.8 million at December 31, 2019. Our core deposits (consisting of demand deposits, money market, passbook and statement and checking accounts) increased $453.2 million, or 210.3%, to $668.7 million at December 31, 2020 from $215.5 million at December 31, 2019. As discussed above, there was an increase in core deposits from certain accounts which we anticipate to be temporary and that a significant portion will be dispersed during the first quarter of 2021. Certificates of deposit decreased $6.2 million, or 9.1%, to $62.1 million at December 31, 2020 from $68.3 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease in certificate of deposits was primarily the result of decrease $12.5 million in certificates of deposit issued through a broker during the year ended December 31, 2020 offset by retail growth of $6.3 million in certificates of deposit.
Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank
During July 2020, the Company refinanced advances of $27.0 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank to reduce the cost of borrowing. The Company incurred a prepayment fee of $810,000. The advances of $27.0 million were refinanced to a five year term at 85 basis points with an effective rate of 1.45% including the impact of the prepayment fee. The refinancing was accounted for as a loan modification. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had $26.3 million and $27.0 million in advances outstanding.
Advances from the Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility
During the second quarter of 2020, the Company utilized the Federal Reserve’s PPPLF to fund a portion of PPP loans. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $48.7 million in PPPLF advances outstanding.
Total Shareholders’ Equity
Total shareholders’ equity increased $5.3 million, or 15.8%, to $38.9 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $33.6 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to net income of $5.8 million, $256,000 increase in other comprehensive income due to the fair value adjustments, net of deferred tax, on the investment securities available-for-sale portfolio combined with $244,000 increase in share-based compensation expense and ESOP shares committed to be released of $125,000. In addition, there was a stock option exercise of $24,000 which contributed to the increase of total shareholders’ equity. Offsetting these increases, was $1.1 million in treasury stock repurchases primarily as part of the stock repurchase plan approved in April 2019.
Comparison of Statements of Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The Company changed its fiscal year end from June 30 to December 31, resulting in a six-month transition period from July 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019. Management’s Discussion and Analysis for the comparison of Consolidated Statements of Income for the year
ended December 31, 2020, uses the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, unaudited, for comparison purposes. Management believes this comparison of like periods is most useful to the investors and readers of this Form 10-K document.
The following table shows the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as well as the six-month periods ended on those same dates:
General
Net income increased $4.8 million, or 471.1%, to $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to increases in non-interest income of $10.2 million and increase in net interest income of $2.5 million partially offset an increases of $5.7 million in non-interest expense, $1.9 million in income tax expense and $298,000 in provision for loan losses as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Interest Income
Total interest income increased $2.0 million, or 16.9%, to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily the result of a $2.6 million increase in interest and fees on loans partially offset by a $373,000 decrease in interest on investment securities and a $249,000 decrease in interest-earning deposits with
banks. The average balance of our interest-earning assets increased by $96.3 million to $414.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $318.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily a result of increases in the average balance of loans of $86.3 million and $24.2 million in interest on interest-earning deposits partially off-set by a decrease of $14.7 million in the average balance of investment securities. The average yield on our interest-earning assets decreased 39 basis points to 3.33% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 3.72% for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of a lower average yield on cash and cash equivalents and investment securities as short term rates declined.
Interest and fees on loans increased $2.6 million, or 24.8%, to $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase resulted primarily from an $86.3 million increase in the average balance of loans to $350.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $264.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The average yield on loans increased 24 basis points to 3.73% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 3.97% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Interest and dividends on investments, mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations decreased $373,000, or 43.6%, to $482,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $855,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease of $224,000 in interest income on U.S. Government Agency securities, corporate bonds and municipal securities to $340,000 from $564,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 as well as a decrease of $149,000 or 51.2% in interest income on mortgage backed securities and collateral mortgage obligation securities to $142,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $291,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The average yield on investment securities decreased 9 basis points to 2.31% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 2.40% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The average balance of investment securities decreased by $14.7 million to $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $35.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Interest on interest-earning deposits decreased $249,000 to $158,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $407,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to a decrease in the average yield on interest-earning deposits decreased 194 basis points to 0.38% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 2.32% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of a decline in interest rates following the COVID-19 pandemic. The targeted federal funds rate was cut to 0% on March 16th and the 10-year Treasury bond fell below 1.00% on March 3, 2020. Offsetting this decrease, was an increase in the average balance of interest-earning deposits of $24.2 million to $41.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Interest Expense
Total interest expense decreased $528,000 to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to a $690,000 decrease in interest on deposits offset by a $119,000 increase in interest expense on advances from the PPPLF and $47,000 increase in interest expense on advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank.
Interest on deposits decreased $690,000 to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of a decrease in average cost of deposits of 40 basis points to 0.87% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 1.27% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Offsetting this decrease, was an increase in the average interest bearing deposits of $38.4 million to $289.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $250.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily the result of a $52.7 million increase in the average balance of our core deposit accounts offset by a decrease of $14.3 million in the average balance of our certificates of deposit. The average rate paid on money market deposits was 0.70% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 0.75% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in the balance of our certificates of deposit of $14.3 million from $76.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to $61.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily the result of a $17.9 million decrease in the average balance of certificates of deposit issued through brokers from $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, offset by an increase of $3.6 million in the average balance in retail certificates of deposit. The average cost of certificates of deposit was 1.60% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 2.14% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Interest expense on advances from the PPPLF was $119,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as the Company utilized this borrowing facility to fund the PPP loans in the second quarter of 2020. The cost of borrowing was 39 basis points on the average outstanding balance of the facility.
Interest on advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank increased $47,000 to $523,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $476,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of an increase in the average balance of Federal Home Loan Bank advances. The average balance of Federal Home Loan Bank advances increased by $8.5 million to $29.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

year ended December 31, 2019. During the July 2020, the Company refinanced advances of $27.0 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank to reduce the cost of borrowings.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income increased $2.5 million, or 30.5%, to $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as we increased our interest income at a greater rate than our interest expense. Our net interest-earning assets increased $21.1 million to $66.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $45.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets.
Rate/Volume Analysis
The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the years indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately, based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.
Provision for Loan Losses
We establish a provision for loan losses, which is charged to operations, in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level we consider necessary to absorb credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimated at the balance sheet date. In determining the level of the allowance for loan losses, we consider past and current loss experience, evaluations of real estate collateral, current economic conditions, volume and type of lending, adverse situations that may affect a borrower’s ability to repay a loan and the levels of non-performing loans. The amount of the allowance is based on estimates, and actual losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or economic conditions change. Due to uncertainty of economic conditions from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company increased the qualitative factors in the calculation of the allowance for loan losses. However, due to the uncertainty of the impact, the Company will continue to monitor and additional adjustment to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary.
This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as circumstances change as more information becomes available. The allowance for loan losses is assessed on a quarterly basis and provisions are made for loan losses as required in order to maintain the allowance. Provision for loan losses increased by $298,000 to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $810,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of charge-offs of $529,000 related to medical education loans during the year ended December 31, 2020. Due to the continued uncertainty of changes in economic conditions from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company increased the qualitative factors in the allowance for loan losses across the loan portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2020, total charge-offs of $529,000 were recorded and $1,000 of
recoveries were received. During the year ended December 31, 2019, charge-offs of $425,000 were recorded and $97,000 of recoveries were received.
Non-Interest Income
Non-interest income increased $10.2 million to $16.9 million for the year ended December 31 2020, from $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in non-interest income compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to an increase of $8.4 million in the gain on sale of loans, net to $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of higher loan sales which increased $366.8 million from $234.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to $600.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in fair value of loans held for sale of $942,000 for the year end December 31, 2020 compared to same period in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in the loans held for sale balance, from $37.9 million at December 31, 2019, to $83.5 million at December 31, 2020. Gain from derivative instruments, net increased $747,000 from $765,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Salaries and employee benefits expense increased by $3.9 million to $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Salaries increased as full time equivalent (FTE) employees increased to one-hundred-twenty-six as of December 31, 2020 from ninety-seven as of December 31, 2019 primarily resulting from the expansion of Company’s lending operations and business banking operations. Mortgage operation expenses increased $636,000 to $940,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $304,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in mortgage operation expenses was a result of higher residential mortgage originations compared to prior year as well as increased reserves for early payoffs (“EPO”). The EPO reserve is for loan pay-offs within six-months to the sale of an investor where the premium is to be paid back and pair-off fees for failure to deliver into a loan commitment when the mortgage loan has closed. The professional fees and other expenses increased $411,000 or 22.3%, to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to increased expenses related to organizational expenses as we continue to grow and expand into new markets.

Occupancy Expenses increased $289,000, or 18.3% to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of an increase in rental expense due to the move of our headquarters to Doylestown, PA as well as leases of additional offices space compared to the same period in 2019. In addition, depreciation expense increased $125,000 due to furniture and equipment placed in service during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense was $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $285,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Federal income taxes included in total taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $1.5 million and $218,000, respectively, with effective federal tax rates of 19.3% and 16.8%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period a year ago reflected an increase in income before taxes.
Pennsylvania state tax was $637,000 and $67,000, respectively, with effective rates of 8.0% and 5.2%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period a year ago reflected an increase in income before taxes. In addition, included in total taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $29,000 of New Jersey state tax.

Rate/Volume Analysis
The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the years indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns.

Provision for Loan Losses
We establish a provision for loan losses, which is charged to operations, in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level we consider necessary to absorb credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimated at the balance sheet date. In determining the level of the allowance for loan losses, we consider past and current loss experience, evaluations of real estate collateral, current economic conditions, volume and type of lending, adverse situations that may affect a borrower’s ability to repay a loan and the levels of non-performing loans. The amount of the allowance is based on estimates, and actual losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or economic conditions change.
This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as circumstances change as more information becomes available. The allowance for loan losses is assessed on a quarterly basis and provisions are made for loan losses as required in order to maintain the allowance. Provision for loan losses increased by $199,000 to $282,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2019, from $83,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2018 primarily as a result of charge-offs of $121,000 related to medical education loans during the six months ended December 31, 2019. During the six months ended December 31, 2019, total charge-offs of $121,000 were recorded and $94,000 of recoveries were received.

Non-Interest Income
Non-interest income increased $2.4 million to $3.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2019 from $1.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2018. The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to increases of $2.1 million in in the gain on sales of loans, net. In addition, gain on sale of available-for-sale securities
was $211,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2019 compared to no gain on sale of available-for-sale securities for the six months ended December 31, 2018.
Non-Interest Expense
Non-interest expense increased $2.0 million, or 40.8%, to $6.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 2019 from $4.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 2018. The increase for the six months ended December 31, 2019 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2018 primarily reflected increases in salaries and employee benefits of $1.4 million, occupancy expenses of $335,000 and professional fees and other expenses of $304,000 partially offset by a $105,000 decrease in federal deposit insurance premiums.
Salaries and employee benefits expense increased by $1.4 million to $4.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2019 from $2.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2018. Salaries increased as full time equivalent (FTE) employees increased to ninety-seven as of December 31, 2019 from seventy-two as of December 31, 2018 primarily resulting from the expansion of Company’s lending operations. Occupancy Expenses increased $335,000 to $870,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2019 from $535,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2018 primarily as a result of an increase in rental expense of $196,000 due to the move of our headquarters to Doylestown, PA as well as leases of additional offices space compared to the same period in 2018. In addition, depreciation expense increased $81,000 due to furniture and equipment placed in service during the six month ended December 31, 2019 and leasehold improvements increased $30,000 compared to the same period in 2018. The professional fees and other expenses increased $304,000, or 24.7%, to $1.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2019 from $1.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2018 increased expenses related to organizational expenses as we continue to grow and expand into new markets. Partially offsetting these increases, was a $105,000 decrease in Federal deposit insurance premiums to $37,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2019 from $142,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2018 as a result of small bank assessment credits during the six months ended December 31, 2019.

Included in the income tax expense reported for six months ended December 31, 2018 was a credit for the ESOP dividend payment.
Pennsylvania state tax was $56,000 and $31,000, respectively, with effective rates of 7.7% and 6.2%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period a year ago reflected an increase in income before taxes.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity Management. Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and proceeds from sales, maturities and calls of securities. In addition, we use brokered certificates of deposit as a funding source of our asset base. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and June 30, 2019, the Company had brokered certificates of deposit of $10.0 million, or 1.2% of total assets, $22.5 million, or 6.3% of total assets and $41.0 million, or 11.9% of total assets, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the six months ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended June 30, 2019, the average cost of brokered certificates of deposit was 1.43%, 2.42% and 2.38%, respectively.
We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh and from the PPPLF. The Bank had advances from the PPPLF of $48.7 million with unused borrowing capacity of $15.7 million as of December 31, 2020. Huntingdon Valley Bank had Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh advances of $27.0 million outstanding with unused borrowing capacity of $161.1 million as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, at December 31, 2020, we had the ability to borrow $3.0 million from the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank and we maintained a line of credit equal to 95% of the fair value of collateral held by the Federal Reserve Bank, which was
$923,000 at December 31, 2020. We have not borrowed against the credit lines with the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The board of directors is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies. We believe that we have enough sources of liquidity to satisfy our short and long-term liquidity needs as of December 31, 2020.
We monitor and adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of: (1) expected loan demand; (2) expected deposit flows; (3) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities; and (4) the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest-earning deposits and short-and intermediate-term securities.
While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which include federal funds sold and interest-earnings deposits in other banks. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents totaled $414.6 million. Securities classified as available-for-sale, which provide additional sources of liquidity, totaled $23.5 million at December 31, 2020. Please refer to the section titled COVID-19 Update for additional information.
Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash used in operating activities was $37.4 million, $2.0 million and $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, the six months ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended June 30, 2019, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loans originations and the purchase of securities, offset by principal collections on loans and proceeds from maturing securities, was $62.5 million, $1.0 million and $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, the six months ended December 31, 2019, and the year ended June 30, 2019, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the six months ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended June 30, 2019, we sold $4.9 million, $12.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively, in securities available-for-sale. Net cash provided by financing activities was $493.9 million, $3.4 million and $44.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, the six months ended December 31, 2019, and the year ended June 30, 2019, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of increases in deposits of $447.1 million, net proceeds of $48.7 million from the PPPLF offset by purchase of treasury stock of $1.1 million and net repayments of $810,000 of borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank. Net cash provided by financing activities for the six ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of increases in deposits of $8.6 million, net decrease of $3.8 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase and net repayments of $1.0 million of borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2019 consisted primarily of increases in deposits of $39.7 million and net proceeds of $6.0 million of borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank, offset by net decrease of $2.0 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase.
We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Certificates of deposit due within one year of December 31, 2020, totaled $51.2 million, or 7.0%, of total deposits. Included in certificates of deposit of $51.2 million due within one year, is approximately $10.0 million of brokered certificates of deposit maturing in six months. If these deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or borrowings than we currently pay. We believe, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered.
Capital Management. Huntingdon Valley Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning Statement of Financial Condition assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At December 31, 2020, Huntingdon Valley Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements
and was considered “well capitalized” under regulatory guidelines. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations
Commitments. As a financial services provider, we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. While these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make. At December 31, 2020, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $84.9 million and unused lines of credit totaling $30.1 million. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current lending commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2020 totaled $51.2 million. Included in certificate of deposits of $51.2 million due within one year, is approximately $10.0 million of brokered certificate of deposits maturing within six months. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize Federal Home Loan Bank advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense.
Contractual Obligations. In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
The financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than does inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.
