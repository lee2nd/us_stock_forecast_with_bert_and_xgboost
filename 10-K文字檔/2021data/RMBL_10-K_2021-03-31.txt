Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes included in this annual report.
Overview
We are a technology driven, motor vehicle dealer and e-commerce platform provider disrupting the vehicle supply chain using innovative technology that aggregates, processes and distributes inventory in a faster and more cost-efficient manner.
We operate an infrastructure-light platform that facilitates the ability of all participants in the supply chain, including RumbleOn, other dealers and consumers to Buy-Sell-Trade-Finance-Transport pre-owned vehicles. Our goal is to transform the way VIN-specific pre-owned vehicles are bought and sold by providing users with the most comprehensive, efficient, timely and transparent transaction experience. While our initial customer facing emphasis through most of 2018 was on motorcycles and other powersports vehicles, we continue to enhance our platform to accommodate nearly any VIN-specific vehicle including motorcycles, ATVs, boats, RVs, cars and trucks. Since our acquisitions of Wholesale, Inc. ("Wholesale") in October 2018 and Autosport USA, Inc. ("Autosport") in February 2019, we have significantly increased our sales of cars and light trucks ("automotive"). Of the 18,024 vehicles we sold in 2020, 12,741 (70.7%) were automotive and 5,283 (29.3%) were powersports vehicles. In 2019, we sold 43,143 vehicles of which 29,952 (69.4%) were automotive and 13,191 (30.6%) were powersports vehicles. In August 2020, we launched RumbleOn 3.0, bringing traditional brick and mortar powersports dealers across the country online. Then, in March 2021, we announced a definitive agreement to combine our ecommerce platform with the RideNow powersports group, the nation's largest powersports retailer as discussed further below.
RideNow Transaction
On March 12, 2021, we announced a definitive agreement to combine with the RideNow dealership group, the nation’s largest powersports retailer, to create the only omnichannel customer experience in powersports and the largest publicly traded powersports dealership platform (the “RideNow Transaction”). Under the terms of the definitive agreement, we will combine with up to 46 entities operating under the RideNow brand for a total consideration of up to $575.4 million, consisting of $400.4 million of cash and approximately 5.8 million shares of our Class B Common Stock. We will finance the cash consideration through a combination of up to $280.0 million of debt and the remainder through the issuance of new equity. We have has entered into a commitment letter with Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. ( “Oaktree”) to provide for the debt financing, subject to certain conditions (the “Oaktree Financing”). The number of shares to be issued to RideNow is subject to increase as described in the definitive agreement. The RideNow Transaction is subject to successful completion of the debt and equity financing, RumbleOn stockholder approval, manufacturer approval, other federal and state regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions as described in the definitive agreement. We expect to close the RideNow Transaction during the second or third quarter of 2021. The foregoing description of the definitive agreement and debt financing does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Plan of Merger and Equity Purchase Agreement, dated March 12, 2021, Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement, dated March 12, 2021, Commitment Letter, dated March 12, 2021, and Warrant, dated March 12, 2021, copies of which are incorporated by reference to this report as Exhibits 2.4, 10.33, 10.31 and 4.11. See the section titled Subsequent Events in this MD&A for a discussion of the RideNow Transaction and Oaktree Financing.
COVID-19 Update
The rapid spread of COVID-19 since March 2020 has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures in an attempt to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders and shutdowns. These measures have impacted and may further impact all or portions of our workforce and operations, the behavior of our customers, and the operations of our partners, vendors, and suppliers. While the federal and state governments have taken measures to try to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, there is considerable uncertainty regarding such measures and potential future measures. The COVID-19 situation has created an unprecedented and challenging time for our Company. Our current focus is on positioning the Company for a strong recovery when this crisis is over. During 2020 we took steps to reduce our inventory and align our operating expenses to the state of the business. We plan to continue to operate as permitted to support our customers’ needs for reliable vehicles and to provide as many jobs as possible for our associates; however, in April 2020 we laid off 169 associates. Future restrictions on our access to and utilization of our logistics and distribution network, our corporate offices, the inspection and reconditioning centers of our partners, and/or our support operations or workforce, or similar limitations for our partners, vendors, or suppliers, and restrictions or disruptions of transportation, could further limit our ability to conduct our business and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. There is no certainty that measures taken by governmental authorities will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed.
Our financial statements reflect estimates and assumptions made by management that affect the carrying values of the Company's assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The judgments, assumptions and estimates used by management are based on historical experience, management's experience, and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management, actual results could differ materially from these judgments and estimates, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could have a material impact on the carrying values of the Company's assets and liabilities and the results of operations. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business and our results of operations and financial condition as conditions evolve as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Nashville Tornado
On March 3, 2020, a severe tornado struck the greater Nashville area causing significant damage to the Company's facilities including contents and inventory held for sale. The Company maintains insurance coverage for damage to its facilities and inventory, as well as business interruption insurance. The loss comprises three components: (1) inventory loss, currently assessed by the insurance carrier at approximately $13,000,000; (2) building and personal property loss, currently assessed by the insurance carrier at $2,783,000; and (3) loss of business income, for which the Company has coverage in the amount of $6,000,000.
All three components of the Company's loss claim have been submitted to its insurers. The Company's inventory claim is subject to a dispute with the carrier as to the policy limits applicable to the loss; however, the insurer has advanced $5,615,268 against the final settlement. The insurer has agreed to pay $2,778,000 on the building and personal property loss, reflecting limits of $2,783,000 net of a $5,000 deductible and has made an interim payment on the building and personal property loss of $2,269,507 to the landlord. The loss of business income claim is ongoing and remains in the process of negotiation, however, the insurer has advanced $250,000 against the final settlement. The Company believes there will be a recovery of all three loss components, however no assurance can be given regarding the amounts, if any, that will be ultimately recovered or when any such recoveries will be made.
Outlook
The COVID-19 pandemic effect on commercial activity and the significant damage sustained to our wholesale automotive business from a tornado in early March 2020 had a significant negative impact on the growth in unit volume and revenue for our powersports, automotive and transportation businesses for the year ended December 31, 2020. Based on the evolving aspects of COVID-19 and uncertainty surrounding its future development, it may continue to have a negative impact on unit volumes and revenue in future periods. Since the significant decrease in demand experienced in early March through mid-April, we have seen monthly unit sales and revenue increase sequentially month-over-month through July 2020. However, during the six-month period ended December 31, 2020, our average days to sale decreased and average selling prices increased as dealers saw high industry-wide market prices. The effect of these higher market prices resulted in lower levels of inventory available to purchase for resale causing a decline in unit sales beginning in September as compared to July and August. This supply and demand imbalance continued to impact the historically seasonally adjusted fourth quarter volume, particularly given the worldwide rise in COVID-19 cases. As the impact of COVID-19 abates over time, we anticipate that unit purchasing levels and sales will return to or exceed levels experienced in the first quarter of 2020 as we increase penetration in existing markets and add new dealers, however we can provide no assurance as to when and how quickly COVID-19 impacts will continue to abate or if spikes in COVID-19 infections will further negatively impact the economy generally or our business.
The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak ultimately impacts our business, sales, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity will depend on the success of the roll out of the vaccines and the efficacy of the vaccines and other future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience significant impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any economic downturn or recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.
Reportable Segments
Business segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which discrete financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing operating performance. Our operations are organized by management into operating segments by line of business. We have determined that we have three reportable segments as defined in generally accepted accounting principles for segment reporting: (1) powersports, (2) automotive and (3) vehicle logistics and transportation. Our powersports and automotive segments consist of the distribution of pre-owned vehicles. The powersports segment consists of the distribution of principally motorcycles, while the automotive segment distributes cars and trucks. In addition, the powersports segment includes the activities of our finance company operations. Our vehicle logistics and transportation service segment provides nationwide automotive transportation services primarily between dealerships and auctions. The accounting policies of the segments are the same and are described in Note 1 - "Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies" in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Key Operation Metrics - Powersports and Automotive Segments
We regularly review a number of metrics, to evaluate our vehicle distribution business, measure our progress, and make strategic decisions. Our key operating metrics reflect what we believe will be the key drivers of our growth, including increasing brand awareness, maximizing the opportunity to source the purchase of low-cost pre-owned vehicles from consumers and dealers while enhancing the selection of vehicles we make available to our customers. Our key operating metrics also demonstrate our ability to translate these drivers into sales and to monetize these retail sales through a variety of product offerings. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the amounts reflected below and in the tables that follow in this section do not include expenditures of $343,820 and $796,365 for the powersports and automotive segments, respectively, that represent costs that are not attributed to specific vehicles.
Vehicles Sold
We define vehicles sold as the number of pre-owned vehicles sold to consumers and dealers in each period, net of returns under our various return policies. We view vehicles sold as a key measure for several reasons. First, vehicles sold is the primary driver of our revenue and, indirectly, gross profit, since vehicle sales enable multiple complementary revenue streams, including financing, vehicle service contracts and trade-ins. Second, vehicles sold increases the base of available customers for referrals and repeat sales. Third, vehicles sold is an indicator of our ability to successfully scale our logistics, fulfillment, and customer service operations. The uncertainty and continuously evolving aspects of COVID-19 may continue to impact the number of units sold in future periods.
Average Days to Sale
We define average days to sale as the average number of days between vehicle acquisition by us and delivery to a customer for all pre-owned vehicles sold in a period. However, this metric does not include any pre-owned vehicles that remain unsold at period end. We view average days to sale as a useful metric due to its impact on pre-owned vehicle average selling price. The uncertainty and continuously evolving aspects of COVID-19 may continue to impact the average days to sale in future periods.
Revenue
Revenue is primarily comprised of pre-owned vehicle sales We sell pre-owned vehicles through consumer and dealer sales channels. These multiple sales channels provide us the opportunity to maximize profitability through increased sales volume and lower average days to sale by selling to the channel where the opportunity is the greatest at any given time based on customer demand, market conditions or inventory availability. The number of pre-owned vehicles sold to any given channel may vary from period to period based on customer demand, market conditions and available inventory. Subject to the impact of COVID-19 on our results, as discussed elsewhere in this MD&A, we expect pre-owned vehicle sales to increase as we begin to utilize a combination of brand building as well as direct response channels to efficiently source and scale our addressable markets while expanding our suite of product offerings to consumers and dealers who may wish to trade-in or to sell us their vehicle independent of a retail or wholesale sale. Factors primarily affecting pre-owned vehicle sales include the number of retail pre-owned vehicles sold and the average selling price of these vehicles. The uncertainty and continuously evolving aspects of COVID-19 may continue to impact our revenue in future periods.
Gross Profit
Gross profit is generated on pre-owned vehicle sales from the difference between the vehicle selling price and our cost of revenue associated with acquiring the vehicle and preparing it for sale. The aggregate dollar gross profit achieved are primarily through dealer sales. Pre-owned vehicles sold through our B2B “Dealer Direct” platform generally have the highest dollar gross profit since the vehicle is sold directly to the dealer without a third-party auction. Pre-owned vehicles sold to dealers through third party auctions are sold at market. Gross margin percent is gross profit as a percentage of pre-owned vehicle sales. Factors affecting gross profit and margin from period to period include the mix of pre-owned vehicles we acquire, our average days to sale, and our pricing strategy. We may opportunistically choose to shift our inventory mix to higher or lower cost vehicles, or to opportunistically raise or lower our prices relative to market to take advantage of supply or demand imbalances, which could temporarily lead to average selling prices and gross profits increasing or decreasing in any given channel. The uncertainty and continuously evolving aspects of COVID-19 may continue to impact our gross profit in future periods.

Key Operation Metrics - Vehicle Logistics and Transportation Services Segment
We regularly review a number of metrics, to evaluate our vehicle logistics and transportation business, measure our progress, and make strategic decisions. Our key operating metrics reflect what we believe will be the key drivers of our growth, including increasing brand awareness, and maximizing the opportunity to drive increased transportation and logistics unit volume. Our key operating metrics also demonstrate our ability to translate these drivers into revenue and increased profitability.
Revenue
Revenue is derived from freight brokerage agreements with dealers, distributors, or private party individuals to transport vehicles from a point of origin to a designated destination. The transaction price is based on the consideration specified in the customer's contract. The freight brokerage agreements are fulfilled by independent third-party transporters who are obligated to meet our performance obligations and standards. Generally, customers are billed either upon shipment of the vehicle or on a monthly basis, and remit payment according to approved payment terms. Revenue is recognized as risks and rewards of transportation of the vehicle is transferred to the owner during delivery. Wholesale Express is considered the principal in the delivery transactions since it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the service. As a result, revenue is recorded gross. In the normal course of operations, Wholesale Express also provides transportation services to Wholesale. Revenue and cost of revenue for these services for the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was $4,070,975 and $9,353,628, respectively, and was eliminated in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Vehicles Delivered
We define vehicles delivered as the number of vehicles delivered from a point of origin to a designated destination under freight brokerage agreements with dealers, distributors, or private party individuals. Vehicles delivered is the primary driver of revenue and in turn profitability in the vehicle logistics and transportation services segment.
Gross Profit
Gross profit is generated on the difference between the price received from a customer under a freight brokerage agreement for the transport of a vehicle from a point of origin to a designated destination minus our cost to contract an independent third-party transporter to fulfill our obligation under the freight brokerage agreement with the customer. We define gross profit per vehicle delivered as the aggregate gross profit in a given period divided by the number of pre-owned vehicles delivered in that period. Gross margin percent is gross profit as a percentage of pre-owned vehicle delivered.
COMPONENTS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Revenue
Revenue for our powersports and automotive segments is derived from our online marketplace and auctions and primarily includes the sale of pre-owned vehicles to consumer and dealers.
Revenue from our vehicle logistics and transportation service segment is derived by providing automotive transportation services between dealerships and auctions throughout the United States.
The Company recognizes revenue using a five-step model that includes: (1) identify the contract; (2) identify the performance obligations; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied. Based on the manner in which we historically recognized revenue, the adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material impact on the amount or timing of our revenue recognition, and we recognized no cumulative effect adjustment upon adoption. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 1- "Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition" for a further description of the Company's revenue recognition.
Pre-owned Vehicle Sales
Pre-owned vehicle sales are primarily comprised of revenue from pre-owned vehicle sales.
We sell pre-owned vehicles through consumer and dealer sales channels. These multiple sales channels provide us the opportunity to maximize profitability through increased sales volume and lower average days to sale by selling to the channel where the opportunity is the greatest at any given time based on customer demand, market conditions or inventory availability. The number of pre-owned vehicles sold to any given channel may vary from period to period based on customer demand, market conditions and available inventory.
Pre-owned vehicle sales represent the aggregate sales of pre-owned vehicles to consumers and dealers through our website or at auctions. We expect pre-owned vehicle sales to increase as we begin to utilize a combination of brand building as well as direct response channels to efficiently source and scale our addressable markets while expanding our suite of product offerings to consumers who may wish to trade-in or to sell us their vehicle independent of a retail sale. Factors affecting pre-owned vehicle sales include the number of retail pre-owned vehicles sold and the average selling price of these vehicles.
The number of pre-owned vehicles we sell depends on our volume of website traffic, volume of cash offers made, our inventory levels and selection, the effectiveness of our branding and marketing efforts, the quality of our customer sales experience, our volume of referrals and repeat customers, the competitiveness of our pricing, competition and general economic conditions. On a quarterly basis, the number of pre-owned vehicles we sell is also affected by seasonality, with demand for pre-owned vehicles reaching the high point in the first half of each year, commensurate with the timing of tax refunds, and diminishing through the rest of the year, with the lowest relative level of pre-owned vehicle sales expected to occur in the fourth calendar quarter.
Our average retail selling price depends on the mix of pre-owned vehicles we acquire and hold in inventory, retail market prices in our markets, our average days to sale, and our pricing strategy. We may choose to shift our inventory mix to higher or lower cost pre-owned vehicles, or to opportunistically raise or lower our prices relative to market to take advantage of supply or demand imbalances, which could temporarily lead to average selling prices increasing or decreasing.
The number of pre-owned vehicles sold to dealers at auctions is determined based on a number of factors including: (i) filling auction sales channel market demand opportunities to maximize sales and gross margin; (ii) a need to balance the Company's overall inventory mix and quantity levels against days to sales targets; and (iii) a need to liquidate those pre-owned vehicles that do not meet the Company's quality standards to be sold through Rumbleon.com.
Vehicle Logistics and Transportation Services
Vehicle logistics and transportation services revenue is generated primarily by entering into freight brokerage agreements with dealers, distributors, or private party individuals to transport vehicles from a point of origin to a designated destination. The transaction price is based on the consideration specified in the customer's contract. A performance obligation is created when the customer under a transportation contract submits a bill of lading for the transport of goods from origin to destination. These performance obligations are satisfied as the shipments move from origin to destination. The freight brokerage agreements are fulfilled by independent third-party transporters. While the Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling to customers, these transporters are obligated to meet our performance obligations and standards. Performance obligations are short-term, with transit days less than one week. Generally, customers are billed either upon shipment of the vehicle or on a monthly basis, and remit payment according to approved payment terms, generally not to exceed 30 days. Revenue is recognized as all risks and rewards of transportation of the vehicle are transferred to the owner during delivery.
Cost of Revenue - Pre-owned Vehicles Sales
Cost of revenue is primarily comprised of cost of pre-owned vehicle sales.
Cost of pre-owned vehicle sales to consumers and dealers includes the cost to acquire pre-owned vehicles and the reconditioning and transportation costs associated with preparing these vehicles for resale. Vehicle acquisition costs are driven by the mix of vehicles we acquire, the source of those vehicles and supply and demand dynamics in the vehicle market. Reconditioning costs are billed by third-party providers and include parts, labor, and other repair expenses directly attributable to specific pre-owned vehicles. Transportation costs consist of costs incurred to transport the vehicles from the point of acquisition. Cost of pre-owned vehicle sales also includes any necessary adjustments to reflect vehicle inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
Cost of Revenue - Vehicle Logistics and Transportation Services
Cost of vehicle transportation and logistics services primarily include the costs of independent third-party transporters to deliver a vehicle from a point of origin to a designated destination.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, general and administrative expenses include costs and expenses for compensation and benefits, advertising and marketing, development and operating our product procurement and distribution system, managing our logistics system, and other corporate overhead expenses, including expenses associated with technology development, legal, accounting, finance, and business development. Selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase substantially in future periods as we execute and aggressively expand our business through increased marketing spending and the addition of management and support personnel to ensure we adequately develop and maintain operational, financial and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures, but we anticipate they will decline as a percentage of sales revenue.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization is comprised of the: (i) amortization of capitalized and acquired technology development; and (ii) depreciation of vehicles, leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment. Depreciation and amortization will continue to increase as continued investments are made in connection with the expansion and growth of the business.
Interest Expense
Interest expense includes interest incurred on notes payable and other long-term debt, which was used to fund startup costs and expenses, technology development, inventory, our transportation fleet, property and equipment and the acquisition of NextGen.
Seasonality
The volume of vehicles sold will generally fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. This seasonality is caused by several factors including weather, the timing of pre-owned vehicles available for sale from selling consumers, the availability and quality of vehicles, holidays, and the seasonality of the retail market for pre-owned vehicles. As a result, revenue and operating expenses related to volume will fluctuate accordingly on a quarterly basis. The fourth calendar quarter typically experiences lower used vehicle auction accessibility as well as additional costs associated with the holidays and winter weather.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following table provides our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, including key financial information relating to our business and operations. This financial information should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II. The results of operations of Autosport are included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 for the Autosport Acquisition Period. In this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, no comparable information is discussed with respect to Autosport for the periods before the Autosport Acquisition Date.
(1) Intercompany freight services from Wholesale Express are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
(2) Inclusive only of the Autosport Acquisition Period.
Powersports and Automotive Segments
The following table provides our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 for the powersports and automotive segments, including key financial information relating to these segments. Our vehicle distribution segment consists of the distribution of powersports and automotive vehicles, as further described below. This financial information should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II. The results of operations of Autosport are included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 for the Autosport Acquisition Period. In this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, no comparable information is discussed with respect to Autosport for the periods before the Autosport Acquisition Date.

Total revenue decreased by $433,440,401 to $384,611,086 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $818,051,487 for the same period of 2019. Total powersports vehicle revenue decreased by $53,482,849 to $47,526,127 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $101,008,976 for the same period of 2019. Total automotive revenue decreased by $379,957,552 to $337,084,959 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $717,042,511 for the same period of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of pre-owned vehicles sold to 18,024 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 43,143 for the same period of 2019, which was partially offset by an increase in the average selling price per unit to $21,339 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $18,961 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in vehicles sold resulted from (i) the adverse impact of COVID-19 pandemic on commercial activity resulting in lower levels of inventory available for purchase causing lower unit sales but higher average selling prices and gross margins due to the supply and demand imbalance; (ii) a reduction in automotive unit sales resulting from the significant damage to the Company’s operating facilities and inventory held for sale in Nashville as a result of the March 2020 tornado; (iii) our continued disciplined approach to sales volume and margin growth as we took prescriptive steps to accelerate profitability; and (iv) a reduction in per vehicle advertising expenditures. As the impact of COVID-19 abates over time, we anticipate that unit purchasing levels and sales will return to or exceed levels experienced in the first quarter of 2020 as we increase penetration in existing markets and add new dealers, however we can provide no assurance as to when and how quickly COVID-19 impacts will continue to abate or if spikes in COVID-19 infections will further negatively impact the economy generally or our business.
Total cost of revenue before impairment loss decreased $425,126,207 to $348,861,202 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $773,987,409 for the same period of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of pre-owned vehicles sold for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period of 2019. Powersports total cost of revenue decreased by $48,612,944 to $40,060,571 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period of 2019. Automotive total cost of revenue decreased by $376,513,263 to $308,800,631 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $685,313,894 for the same period of 2019.
Powersports
The following table provides the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 for our powersports segment, including key financial information relating to the powersports business. This financial information should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II.
Powersports Vehicle Revenue
Total powersports vehicle revenue decreased by $53,482,849 to $47,526,127 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $101,008,976 for the same period of 2019. The decrease in powersports revenue was primarily due to a decrease in the number of pre-owned vehicles sold to 5,283 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 13,191 for the same period of 2019, offset by an increase in the average selling price per vehicle to $8,996 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $7,657 for the same period of 2019. The decrease in vehicles sold and increase in average selling price resulted from (i) the adverse impact of COVID-19 pandemic on commercial activity resulting in lower levels of inventory available for purchase causing lower unit sales but higher average selling prices and gross margins due to the supply and demand imbalance; (ii) our continued disciplined approach to sales volume and margin growth as we took prescriptive steps to accelerate profitability; and (iii) a reduction in per vehicle advertising expenditures. As the impact of COVID-19 abates over time, we anticipate that unit purchasing levels and sales will return to or exceed levels experienced in the first quarter of 2020 as we increase penetration in existing markets and add new dealers, however we can provide no assurance as to when and how quickly COVID-19 impacts will continue to abate or if spikes in COVID-19 infections will further negatively impact the economy generally or our business.
Total powersports vehicle revenue from the sale to consumers decreased by $2,965,607 to $5,330,008 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $8,295,615 for the same period of 2019. The decline in powersports revenue was primarily due to the decrease in the number of pre-owned vehicles sold to 458 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 955 for the same period of 2019, which was partially offset by an increase in the average selling price per vehicle to $11,638 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $8,687 for the same period of 2019. The decrease in vehicles sold and increase in average selling price per unit for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period of 2019 resulted from: (i) the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial activity resulting in lower levels of inventory available for purchase causing lower unit sales but higher average selling prices and gross margins due to the supply and demand imbalance; (ii) our continued disciplined approach to sales volume and margin growth as we took prescriptive steps to accelerate profitability; and (iii) a reduction in per vehicle advertising expenditures. As the impact of COVID-19 abates over time, we anticipate that unit purchasing levels and sales will return to or exceed levels experienced in the first quarter of 2020 as we increase penetration in existing markets and add new dealers, however we can provide no assurance as to when and how quickly COVID-19 impacts will continue to abate or if spikes in COVID-19 infections will further negatively impact the economy generally or our business.
Total powersports vehicle revenue from the sale to dealers decreased by $50,517,242 to $42,196,119 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $92,713,361 for the same period of 2019. The decline in powersports revenue was primarily due to the decrease in the number of pre-owned vehicles sold to 4,825 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 12,236 for the same period of 2019, which was partially offset by an increase in the average selling price per vehicle to $8,745 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $7,577 for the same period of 2019. The decrease in vehicles sold and increase in average selling price per unit for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 resulted from: (i) the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial activity resulting in lower levels of inventory available for purchase causing lower unit sales but higher average selling prices and gross margins due to the supply and demand imbalance; and (ii) our continued disciplined approach to sales volume and margin growth as we took prescriptive steps to accelerate profitability; and (iii) a reduction in per vehicle advertising expenditures. As the impact of COVID-19 abates over time, we anticipate that unit purchasing levels and sales will return to or exceed levels experienced in the first quarter of 2020 as we increase penetration in existing markets and add new dealers, however we can provide no assurance as to when and how quickly COVID-19 impacts will continue to abate or if spikes in COVID-19 infections will further negatively impact the economy generally or our business.

Vehicle Logistics and Transportation Services Segment
The following table provides our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 for our vehicle logistics and transportation services segment, including key financial information relating to this segment. This financial information should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II.
Vehicle Logistics and Transportation Services Revenue
Total logistic and transportation service revenue increased by $3,955,644 to $35,887,132 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $31,931,488 for 2019. The increase in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 resulted from the increased in average revenue per vehicle delivered of $585 compared to $412 for 2019 offset by a decrease in the total vehicles delivered to 61,314 compared to 77,449 for 2019. The increase in average revenue per vehicle delivered was a result of: (i) our more disciplined approach to sales volume and margin growth as we took prescriptive steps to accelerate profitability; and (ii) an increase in commercial activity during 2020 as compared to 2019 resulting in a greater demand for transportation services, as sales channels, marketing activities and supply chains progressed towards normalized activity levels. The greater demand resulted in a significant increase in the market rates charged per unit delivered; and (iii) increased emphasis on sales through implementation of sales performance improvement plans. As the impact of COVID-19 abates over time, we anticipate that vehicles transported, and revenue will return to or exceed levels experienced in the first quarter of 2020 as we increase penetration in existing markets and add new dealers, distributors, or private party individuals, however we can provide no assurance as to when and how quickly COVID-19 impacts will continue to abate or if spikes in COVID-19 infections will further negatively impact the economy generally or our business.
In the normal course of operations, the Company utilizes transportation services of Wholesale Express. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, intercompany freight services provided by Wholesale Express was $4,070,975 and $9,353,628, respectively and was eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
Vehicle Logistics and Transportation Services Cost of Revenue
Total logistic and transportation service cost of revenue increased by $2,893,614 to $28,271,204 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $25,377,590 for 2019. The increase in cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 resulted from the increased in average cost of revenue per vehicle delivered to $461 compared to $328 for 2019 offset by a decrease in the total vehicles delivered to 61,314 as compared to 77,449 for 2019. The increase in average cost of revenue per vehicle delivered was a result of an increase in commercial activity during 2020 as compared to 2019 resulting in a greater demand for transportation services, as sales channels, marketing activities and supply chains began to progress towards normalized pre-COVID-19 activity levels. The greater demand resulted in a significant increase in the market rates charged per unit delivered. As the impact of COVID-19 abates over time, we anticipate that vehicles transported, and revenue will return to or exceed levels experienced in the first quarter of 2020 as we increase penetration in existing markets and add new dealers, distributors, or private party individuals, however we can provide no assurance as to when and how quickly COVID-19 impacts will continue to abate or if spikes in COVID-19 infections will further negatively impact the economy generally or our business. Included in cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, was freight services purchases from Wholesale Express of $4,070,975 and $9,353,628, respectively and was eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
Selling, general and administrative
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $32,964,901 to $53,659,348 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $86,624,249 for the same period of 2019. The decrease in selling, general and administrative for the year ended December 31, 2020 was a result of: (i) our continued disciplined approach to sales volume and margin growth as we took prescriptive steps to accelerate profitability, which resulted in the sale of fewer vehicles and a corresponding reduction in related selling expenses, sales related compensation, and marketing spend for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019; (ii) a reduction in automotive vehicle sales resulting from the significant damage to the Company's operating facilities and inventory held for sale in Nashville as a result of the March 3, 2020 tornado; and (iii) a reduction in staffing levels and adjusted purchasing levels to align with demand and market conditions and a deferral of discretionary growth expenditures such as travel, facilities, information technology investments due to the adverse impact of COVID-19 on commercial activity.
Compensation and related costs decreased by $7,767,712 to $25,734,308 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $33,502,020 for the same period of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in headcount associated with our response to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. In early April 2020 we significantly reduced our staffing in an effort to position our business to be lean and flexible in this period of lower demand and higher uncertainty with the goal of preparing the Company for a strong recovery when the outbreak is contained. The company had 157 full-time and two part-time employees at December 31, 2020 as compared to 300 full-time employees on December 31, 2019. As the impact of COVID-19 abates over time, we anticipate that unit volume levels and sales will return to or exceed levels experienced in the first quarter of 2020. At that time, we will take a measured approach to increasing our headcount, which will result in an increase in sales related and marketing compensation in absolute dollar terms but a decrease in these expenses as a percentage of total revenue. However, we can provide no assurance as to when and how quickly COVID-19 impacts will continue to abate or if spikes in COVID-19 infections will further negatively impact the economy generally or our business.
Advertising and marketing decreased by $12,940,978 to $5,287,284 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $18,228,262 for the same period of 2019. The decrease was a result of: (i) the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in significantly reduced commercial activity, including a decrease in unit purchases and sales of vehicles; (ii) a reduction in unit sales resulting from the significant damage to the Company's operating facilities and inventory held for sale in Nashville as a result of the March 3, 2020 tornado; (iii) our continued disciplined approach to sales volume and margin growth as we took prescriptive steps to accelerate profitability; and (iv) a reduction in per vehicle advertising expenditures. As the impact of COVID-19 abates over time, we anticipate that unit volume levels and sales will return to or exceed levels experienced in the first quarter of 2020. At that time, we will take a measured approach to increasing our marketing spend, which will result in an increase in marketing expenses in absolute dollar terms but a decrease in marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue. However, we can provide no assurance as to when and how quickly COVID-19 impacts will continue to abate or if spikes in COVID-19 infections will further negatively impact the economy generally or our business.
Professional fees increased by $606,024 to $3,148,381 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2,542,357 for the same period of 2019. The increase was primarily a result of professional fees and costs incurred in connection with our insurance claims and other matters attributed to the Nashville Tornado, and legal, accounting and other professional fees and expenses incurred in connection with the activities associated with operating the business. Fees and expenses were incurred for: (i) equity financings; (ii) debt financings; (iii) general corporate matters; (iv) the preparation of quarterly and annual financial statements; and (v) the preparation and filing of regulatory reports required of the Company for public reporting purposes. For additional information, see Note 4 - "Acquisitions," Note 8 - "Notes Payable and Lines of Credit" and Note 9 - "Stockholders' Equity," in the accompanying Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Technology development expenses decreased by $987,200 to $1,421,138 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2,408,338 for the same period of 2019. The decrease was a result of the negative impact of COVID-19 resulting from sheltering-in-place and significantly reduced commercial activity, resulting in a temporary reduction in discretionary growth expenditures on information technology spending. Total technology costs and expenses incurred for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $3,529,743 of which $2,145,055 was capitalized. For the year ended December 31, 2019, total technology costs and expenses incurred were $5,494,081 of which $3,085,743 was capitalized. For the year ended December 31, 2020, a third-party contractor billed $602,873 of the total technology development costs as compared to $1,028,884 for the same period of 2019. The amortization of capitalized technology development costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1,887,305 as compared to $1,436,088 for the same period of 2019. As the impact of COVID-19 abates over time, we anticipate that unit volume levels and sales will return to or exceed levels experienced in the first quarter of 2020. At that time, we will take a measured approach to increasing our technology development expenses as we continue to upgrade and enhance our technology infrastructure, invest in our products, expand the functionality of our platform and provide new product offerings. We also expect technology development expenses to continue to be affected by variations in the amount of capitalized internally developed technology.
General and administrative expenses decreased by $11,875,035 to $18,068,237 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $29,943,272 for the same period of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in vehicles sold for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019 which resulted in a $7,513,991 reduction in auction and floor plan fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019. The decrease in vehicles purchased and sold was a result of: (i) the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial activity resulting in lower levels of inventory available for purchase causing lower unit sales due to the supply and demand imbalance; (ii) a reduction in units available for sale as a result of the significant damage to the Company’s operating facilities and inventory held for sale in Nashville resulting from the March 2020 tornado; (iii) our continued disciplined approach to sales volume and margin growth as we took prescriptive steps to accelerate profitability; and (iv) a reduction in per vehicle advertising expenditures. Additionally, in connection with the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial activity we implemented a reduction in administrative costs and expenses as well as purchasing levels to align with demand and market conditions and deferred discretionary growth expenditures such as travel, facility cost and other business expenses which resulted in a decrease in these costs and expenses of $2,511,044, net of a $739,581 increase in rent expense for new facilities for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019. Included in General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 is the recognition of an impairment loss on goodwill of $1,850,000. As the impact of COVID-19 abates over time and commercial activity increases, we anticipate that unit volume levels and sales will return to or exceed levels experienced in the first quarter of 2020. At that time, we will take a measured approach to increasing our general and administrative spending, which will result in an increase in in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollar terms but decrease as a percentage of total revenue. However, we can provide no assurance as to when and how quickly COVID-19 impacts will continue to abate or if spikes in COVID-19 infections will further negatively impact the economy generally or our business.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization increased by $356,513 to $2,142,939 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1,786,426 for the same period of 2019. The increase in depreciation and amortization is a result of the cumulative investments made in connection with the development of the business which included capitalized technology acquisition and development costs of $2,145,055 and $174,786 in additions to property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $3,085,743 of capitalized technology acquisition and development costs and $119,748 in additions to property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in capitalized technology acquisition and development costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period of 2019 was a result of a temporary reduction in discretionary growth expenditures on information technology spending due to the negative impact of COVID-19 and the effect of sheltering-in-place and significantly reduced commercial activity. For the year ended December 31, 2020, amortization of capitalized technology development was $1,887,305 as compared to $1,436,088 for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization on vehicle, furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements was $255,634 as compared to $350,338 for the same period of 2019.
Interest Expense

Interest expense consists of interest on the: (i) Hercules Loan; (ii) Private Placement Notes; (iii) the subordinated secured promissory note issued to NextGen (the "NextGen Note"); (iv) the Credit Facility and the NextGear Credit Line (each as defined below) (together, the "Line of Credit-Floor Plans"); (v) PPP Loans; (vi) convertible senior notes; and (vii) the notes issued in connection with the Autosport Acquisition (the "Convertible Notes-Autosport"). The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period of 2019 was primarily from a reduction in total indebtedness outstanding which included amounts outstanding under floor plan lines of credit which was a result of a decrease in the number of vehicles sold to 18,024 compared to 43,143 for 2019, and reductions in principal balances under various notes. Interest expense on the Private Placement Notes for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $140,136 and included $75,601 of discount amortization compared to interest expense of $316,091, which included $259,396 of debt discount amortization for 2019.

There was no interest expense on the Hercules Loan in 2020 compared to interest expense for year ended December 31, 2019 of 758,466, which included $342,841 of debt discount amortization. See Part II, Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 8-"Notes Payable and Lines of Credit "
for additional discussion.
On May 14, 2019, the Company made a payment to Hercules Capital Inc. ("Hercules") of $11,134,696, representing the principal, accrued and unpaid interest, fees, costs and expenses outstanding under its Loan and Security Agreement (the "Loan Agreement") with Hercules dated April 30, 2018 (the "Hercules Indebtedness"). Upon the payment, all outstanding indebtedness and obligations of the Company owed to Hercules under the Loan Agreement were paid in full, and the Loan Agreement was terminated. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the Note Offering (described below) to pay the Hercules Indebtedness. In accordance with the guidance in ASC 470-50, Debt, the Company accounted for the extinguishment of the Hercules Loan Agreement as an extinguishment and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $1,499,250 for the year ended December 31, 2019 the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The loss on early extinguishment consisted primarily of the prepayment penalty paid to Hercules and unamortized debt discounts including the remaining portion of warrant values and debt issuance costs.
Loss Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries
On March 3, 2020, a severe tornado struck the greater Nashville area causing significant damage to the Company's facilities including contents and inventory held for sale. The Company maintains insurance coverage for damage to its facilities and inventory, as well as business interruption insurance. The loss was comprised of three components: (1) inventory loss, assessed by the insurance carrier at approximately $13,000,000; (2) building and personal property loss, primarily impacting our leased facilities, assessed by the insurance carrier at $2,783,000; and (3) loss of business income, for which the company has coverage in the amount of $6,000,000.
All three components of the Company's loss claim have been submitted to its insurers. The Company's inventory claim is subject to a dispute with the carrier as to the policy limits applicable to the loss; however, the insurer has advanced $5,615,268 against the final settlement. The insurer has agreed to pay $2,778,000 on the building and personal property loss, reflecting limits of $2,783,000 net of a $5,000 deductible. The insurer has made an interim payment on the building and personal property loss of $2,269,507 to the landlord. The loss of business income claim is ongoing and remains in the process of negotiation, however, the insurer has advanced $250,000 against the final settlement. The Company believes there will be a recovery of all three loss components, however no assurance can be given regarding the amounts, if any, that will be ultimately recovered or when any such recoveries will be made.
As a result of the damage caused by the tornado the Company concluded that the utility of the inventory damaged by the storm was impaired as a result of physical damage sustained. Whether the impairment is caused by physical destruction or an adverse change in the utility of the inventory, entities should assess whether an inventory impairment or write-off is required in accordance with ASC 330-10-35-1 through 35-11, which address adjustments of inventory balances to the lower of cost or market and requires that when there is evidence that the utility of goods will be less than cost, the difference is recognized as a loss of the current period. During the year ended December 31, 2020 the Company recorded an impairment loss on inventory of $11,738,413 comprised of $4,453,775 for vehicles that were a total loss and $7,284,638 in loss in value for vehicles partially damaged and subject to repair. The impairment loss is reported in cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. On July 23, 2020, the insurer made an advance against the final settlement of the damage claim on inventory of $5,615,268. This recovery has been recorded as a separate component of operating loss in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Derivative Liability
In connection with the Notes, a derivative liability was recorded at issuance with an interest make-whole provision of $20,673 based on a lattice model using a stock price of $14.60, an estimated volatility of 55.0% and risk-free rate rates over the entire 10-year yield curve. This amount was recorded as a debt discount and is amortized to interest expense over the term of the Notes using the effective interest rate. The derivative liability is remeasured at each reporting date with the change in value of $10,806 and $1,302,500, respectively being recorded in the Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The value of the derivative liability as of December 31, 2020 is $16,694 as compared to $27,500 on December 31, 2019.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or net income as a measure of operating performance or cash flows or as a measure of liquidity. Non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily calculated the same way by different companies and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to U.S. GAAP.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss adjusted to add back interest expense including debt extinguishment and depreciation and amortization, and certain charges and expenses, such as goodwill impairment, impairment loss on automotive inventory, impairment loss on plant & equipment, insurance recovery proceeds, non-cash stock-based compensation, change in derivative liability, litigation expenses, severance, new business development and other non-recurring costs, as these charges and expenses are not considered a part of our core business operations and are not an indicator of ongoing, future company performance.
Adjusted EBITDA is one of the primary metrics used by management to evaluate the financial performance of our business. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Further, we believe it is helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results, because it excludes, among other things, certain results of decisions that are outside the control of management, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure and capital investments.
The following tables reconcile Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for the periods presented:
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We generate cash from the sale of used vehicles and providing vehicle logistics and transportation services for used vehicles. We generate additional cash flows through our financing activities including our short-term revolving inventory floor plan facilities, the issuance of long-term notes, and new issuances of equity. Historically, cash generated from financing activities has funded growth and expansion and strategic initiatives and we expect this to continue in the future.
Our ability to service our debt and fund working capital, capital expenditures, and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating and financing activities, which is subject to our future operating performance, as well as to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other conditions, some of which may be beyond our control. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, our expansion of our various lines of business and the timing and extent of our spending to support our technology and software development efforts.
In connection with the RideNow Transaction, on March 12, 2021, we executed a secured promissory note with BRF Finance Co., LLC (“BRF Finance”), an affiliate of B. Riley Securities, Inc., pursuant to which BRF Finance loaned us $2.5 million (the “Bridge Loan”). The Bridge Loan matures on the earlier of September 30, 2021 or upon the issuance of debt or equity above a threshold. The Bridge Loan is secured by certain intellectual property assets held by our subsidiary, NextGen Pro, LLC. Interest will accrue on the Bridge Loan until maturity (by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate of 12% annually. The foregoing description of the Bridge Loan does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Secure Promissory Note, dated March 12, 2021, a copy of which is incorporated by reference to this report as Exhibit 10.31.
The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which assumes the continuity of operations, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities as they come due in the normal course of business. Management believes that current working capital, results of operations, and existing financing arrangements are sufficient to fund operations for at least one year from the financial statement date.
We had the following liquidity resources available as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:
(1) Amounts included in restricted cash represent the deposits required under the Company's short-term revolving facilities.
On January 14, 2020, the Company closed a public offering at a public price of $11.40 per share (the "2020 Public Offering"). On January 16, 2020, the Company received notice of the Underwriters' intent to exercise the over-allotment option in full (the "Over-allotment Exercise"). On January 17, 2020, the Company closed the Over-allotment Exercise. The Over-allotment Exercise increased the aggregate number of shares sold in the 2020 Public Offering to 1,035,000. Including the Over-allotment Exercise, proceeds from the 2020 Public Offering, after deducting the 7.0% underwriter’s commission and $75,000 for underwriter expenses, were $10,780,080.
Also on January 10, 2020, the Company entered into a Note Exchange and Subscription Agreement, as amended by the Joinder Agreement, with the investors in the 2019 Note Offering (as defined below), pursuant to which the Company agreed to complete (i) a note exchange pursuant to which $30,000,000 of the Old Notes (as defined below) would be cancelled in exchange for a new series of 6.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the "New Notes"), and (ii) the issuance of additional New Notes in a private placement in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act as a sale not involving any public offering. On January 14, 2020, the Company closed the 2020 Note Offering. The proceeds for the 2020 Note Offering, after deducting for the payment of accrued interest and offering-related expenses, but exclusive of company costs were $8,272,375.
On May 9, 2019, the Company entered into a purchase agreement with JMP Securities LLC to issue and sell $30,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of its 6.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the "Old Notes") in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") (the "2019 Note Offering"). The proceeds for the 2019 Note Offering after deducting the initial purchaser's discounts, advisory fees, and related offering expenses, were approximately $27,385,500.
As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, excluding operating lease liabilities and the derivative liability, the outstanding principal amount of indebtedness was $53,108,353 and $82,585,522, respectively, summarized in the table below. See Note 8 - Notes Payable and Lines of Credit and Note 20 - Subsequent Events to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our debt.
The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Operating Activities
Our primary sources of operating cash flows result from the sales of used vehicles and ancillary products. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are purchases of inventory, cash used to acquire customers, technology development and personnel-related expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $17,143,227, an increase of $56,890,557 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $39,747,330 for the same period of 2019. The increase in our net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to: (i) a $32,094,116 decrease in our net loss, which excluded aggregate impairment losses on inventory and plant and equipment of $11,916,039. In addition, the Company received a $5,615,268 insurance recovery due to the Nashville tornado; and (ii) a $19,181,173 of changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily vehicle inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The change in net loss was a result of: (i) our continued disciplined approach to sales volume and margin growth as we took prescriptive steps to accelerate profitability, which resulted in the sale of fewer vehicles and a corresponding reduction in related selling expenses, sales related compensation, marketing and general and administrative spend for the year ended December 31, 2020; and (ii) a reduction in staffing levels, adjusted purchasing levels to align with demand and market conditions and a deferral of discretionary growth expenditures such as travel, facilities, information technology investments due to the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial activity
Investing Activities
Our primary use of cash for investing activities is for technology development and acquisitions to expand our operations. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2,281,405, a decrease of $1,589,818 compared to 2019. The decrease results from a reduction in technology spending and no acquisition activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019. The decrease in technology spending for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period of 2019 was a result of a reduction in staffing levels, adjusted purchasing levels and a deferral of discretionary growth expenditures due to the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial activity. The Company acquired Autosport in February 2019 which included a cash payment of $835,000.
Financing Activities
Cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to our short and long-term debt activity and proceeds from equity issuances which have been used to provide working capital and for general corporate purposes, including paying down our short-term revolving facilities. Cash used in financing activities was $18,072,217 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $34,559,933 for 2019. The $52,632,150 decrease in cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period of 2019 was a result of a: (i) $43,322,228 increase in repayments on floor plan lines of credit; (ii) a reduction in net proceeds of $4,916,575 received from notes payable; and (iii) a reduction in net proceeds from equity offerings of $4,393,347 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period of 2019.
Liquidity
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has incurred losses from inception through December 31, 2020 and may incur additional losses in the future. As the Company continues to expand its business, build its brand name and awareness and continues technology and software development efforts, it may need access to additional capital. Historically, the Company has raised additional equity or debt instruments to fund the expansion; refer to Note 8 - NOTES PAYABLE and Note 9 - STOCKHOLDER'S EQUITY. Management believes that current working capital, availability of equity under its current shelf registration statement, results of operations, and expected continued inventory financing are sufficient to fund operations for at least one year from the financial statement issuance date.
The worldwide spread of the COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in a global slowdown of economic activity which decreased demand for a broad variety of goods and services, while also disrupting sales channels, marketing activities and supply chains for an unknown period of time until the outbreak is contained. This is impacting the Company's business and the powersport, automotive and transport industries as a whole. The Company has positioned its business today to be lean and flexible in this period of lower demand and higher uncertainty with the goal of preparing the Company for a strong recovery as the crisis is contained. The Company believes its online business model allows it to quickly respond to market demand or changes in the businesses it operates as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
Subsequent Events
RideNow Definitive Agreement
On March 12, 2021, the Company entered into a Plan of Merger and Equity Purchase Agreement (the “RideNow Agreement”) with RO Merger Sub I, Inc., an Arizona corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub I”), RO Merger Sub II, Inc., an Arizona corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub II”), RO Merger Sub III, Inc., an Arizona corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub III”), RO Merger Sub IV, Inc., an Arizona corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub IV,” and together with Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, and Merger Sub III, the “Merger Subs”), C&W Motors, Inc., an Arizona corporation, Metro Motorcycle, Inc., an Arizona corporation, Tucson Motorcycles, Inc., an Arizona corporation, and Tucson Motorsports, Inc., an Arizona corporation, William Coulter, an individual (“Coulter”), Mark Tkach, an individual (“Tkach” and together with Coulter, the “Principal Owners”), and certain other persons who own equity interests in the Acquired Companies (as defined in the RideNow Agreement) and execute a Seller Joinder (as defined in the RideNow Agreement) (together with the Principal Owners, the “Sellers” and each, a “Seller”), and Tkach, as the representative of the Sellers (the “Sellers’ Representative”). The Acquired Companies own and operate powersports retail dealerships under the RideNow brand which include sales, financing, and parts and service of new and used motorcycles, ATVs, UTVs, scooters, side by sides, sport bikes, cruisers, watercraft, and other vehicles and ancillary businesses and activities relating thereto.
The RideNow Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the RideNow Agreement, (i) the Company will acquire all of the equity interests (the “Equity Purchases”) in the Transferred Entities (as defined in the RideNow Agreement), (ii) Merger Sub I will merge with and into C&W Motors, Inc., with C&W Motors, Inc. continuing as a surviving corporation, (iii) Merger Sub II will merge with and into Metro Motorcycle, Inc., with Metro Motorcycle, Inc. continuing as a surviving corporation, (iv) Merger Sub III will merge with and into Tucson Motorcycles, Inc., with Tucson Motorcycles, Inc. continuing as a surviving corporation, and (v) Merger Sub IV will merge with and into Tucson Motorsports, Inc., with Tucson Motorsports, Inc. continuing as a surviving corporation, in each case under the laws of the State of Arizona and each as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Mergers”). The Equity Purchases and the Mergers will result in the acquisition from the Sellers of up to 46 Acquired Companies (the “RideNow Transaction”). The RideNow Transaction is expected to close (the “Closing”) in the second or third quarter of 2021. Effective as of the Closing, Tkach and Coulter will become executive officers and directors of the Company.
The RideNow Agreement provides that the Company will acquire the Acquired Companies in exchange for (i) $400,400,000 in cash plus or minus any adjustments for net working capital and closing indebtedness, and (ii) shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock having a value of $175,000,000 (the “Closing Payment Shares”), valued equally, on a per share basis, based upon the lowest value of (A) $30.00; (B) the VWAP of the Company's Class B Common Stock for the twenty (20) trading days immediately preceding the Closing, and (C) the value on a per share basis paid for the Class B Common Stock or any shares underlying securities convertible into or exercisable for Class B Common Stock by any person which purchases Class B Common Stock or any shares underlying securities convertible into or exercisable for Class B Common Stock from the Company from the date of the RideNow Agreement until the Closing not including purchases of Class B Common Stock underlying currently outstanding options, warrants, convertible notes, or other derivative securities. Ten percent (10%) of the Closing Payment Shares will be escrowed at Closing and will be released pursuant to the terms of the RideNow Agreement. The Company will finance the cash consideration through a combination of approximately $280,000,000 of debt provided by the Initial Lender (as defined below) and through the issuance of new equity for the remainder thereof.
Each of the Company, the Merger Subs, and the Sellers has provided customary representations, warranties and covenants in the RideNow Agreement. The completion of the RideNow Transaction is subject to various closing conditions, including (a) the making of all filings and other notifications required to be made under any Antitrust Law (as defined in the RideNow Agreement) for the consummation of the RideNow Transaction, the expiration or termination of all waiting periods relating thereto, and the receipt of all clearances, authorizations, actions, non-actions, or other consents required from a governmental authority under any Antitrust Law for the consummation of the RideNow Transaction, (b) performance in all respects by each party of its covenants and agreements, (c) the Company obtaining stockholder approval of the RideNow Transaction and related matters, (d) the Closing Payment Shares being approved for listing on Nasdaq, and (e) the receipt of consent to the RideNow Transaction from certain powersports manufacturers.
Certain RideNow minority equity holders are not initially parties to the RideNow Agreement and some of such minority holders have rights of first refusal (“ROFR”) with respect to the RideNow entity in which they own a stake. If any of these equity holders either decide not to sell their interests to the Company or to exercise their ROFR, RumbleOn will not be able to acquire all of the Equity Interests of the Acquired Companies, or in certain cases any interests in an Acquired Company, and the consideration payable therefor in the RideNow Transaction will be correspondingly reduced. RideNow anticipates that all minority owners will participate in the RideNow Transaction and that no minority owners will exercise their ROFR, but there is no assurance this will occur.
The RideNow Agreement contains certain termination rights for both the Company and the Sellers' Representative. Both the Company and the Sellers' Representative have the right to terminate the RideNow Agreement if the Closing does not occur on or before June 30, 2021, subject to certain rights of the parties to extend the termination date to July 31, 2021, as set forth in the RideNow Agreement.
Commitment Letter
On March 12, 2021, the Company entered into a commitment letter (the “Commitment Letter”) with Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. ( “Oaktree”). The Commitment Letter provides that, subject to the conditions set forth therein, Oaktree or certain funds or accounts within its Strategic Credit Strategy (the “Initial Lender”) commits to provide senior secured term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $400,000,000 (the “Credit Facility”), comprised of (i) an initial advance of $280,000,000 to fund the RideNow Transaction, consummate the Refinancing (as defined in the Commitment Letter) and pay the RideNow Transaction costs and (ii) a delayed draw term facility of up to $120,000,000 to fund permitted acquisitions and similar investments and related fees and expenses.
The Credit Facility interest rates will be, at the option of the Company, (a) Adjusted LIBOR (as defined in the Commitment Letter) plus 8.25%, of which (i) Adjusted LIBOR plus 7.25% shall be paid in cash and (ii) 1.00% shall be payable in kind or (b) ABR (as defined in the Commitment Letter) plus 7.25%, of which (i) ABR plus 6.25% shall be paid in cash and (ii) 1.00% shall be payable in kind. The Credit Facility shall mature on the fifth anniversary of the Closing date of the RideNow Transaction (subject to extension with the consent of only the extending lender).
The Company and its subsidiaries will grant certain security interests to the Initial Lender to secure the Credit Facility, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, all to be more fully set forth in the definitive documentation for the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility will be subject to prepayment with the proceeds of certain events including 50% of excess cash flow, 100% of certain asset sales, 100% of proceeds of certain debt issuances, and 50% of certain public or private equity financings. The Commitment Letter provides that the Credit Facility will contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default, subject to certain carve-outs and exceptions as more fully described in the Commitment Letter.
The commitment to provide the Credit Facility is subject to certain conditions, including: the receipt of customary closing documents, completion of applicable “know your customer” requests and delivery of documentation related thereto, no material adverse change, delivery of customary financial reporting, specified representations and warranties, perfection of certain security interests, and delivery of customary legal opinions. The Company will pay certain fees and expenses in connection with obtaining the Credit Facility.
Warrant
In connection with the Commitment Letter, in lieu of a commitment fee, the Company has agreed to issue to Oaktree a warrant to purchase a number of shares of Class B Common Stock at an exercise price per share to be determined either at Closing or at termination of the Commitment Letter (the “Warrant”). If issued at Closing, the Warrant will be for that number of shares equal to $40,000,000 divided by the lowest price per share at which equity is issued in connection with financing the RideNow Transaction, which price shall also be the exercise price. If issued in connection with a termination of the Commitment Letter, the Warrant will be issued to purchase that number of shares equal to five percent (5%) of the Company's fully diluted market capitalization at the close of business on the day after a termination of the Commitment Letter is publicly announced divided by the weighted average price of the Company's Class B Common Stock for the five days immediately preceding such date, which price shall also be the exercise price. The Warrant is immediately exercisable upon the Closing or five days after the termination of the Commitment Letter and expires eighteen (18) months after the Closing or termination of the Commitment Letter.
Bridge Loan
Also in connection with the RideNow Transaction, on March 12, 2021, the Company and its subsidiary, NextGen Pro, LLC (“NextGen Pro”), executed a secured promissory note with BRF Finance Co., LLC (“BRF Finance”), an affiliate of B. Riley Securities, Inc., pursuant to which BRF Finance has loaned the Company $2,500,000 (the “Bridge Loan”). The Bridge Loan matures on the earlier of September 30, 2021 or upon the issuance of debt or equity above a threshold. The Bridge Loan is secured by certain intellectual property assets held by NextGen Pro as set forth in Exhibit A to the secured promissory note. Interest will accrue on the Bridge Loan until maturity (by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate of 12% annually.
Certificate of Amendment and Changes to Incentive Plan
In contemplation of the RideNow Transaction, on March 9, 2021, the Board of Directors (the "Board") approved, subject to stockholder approval, (i) an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation of the Company to increase the number of shares of authorized Class B Common Stock to 100,000,000 (the “Certificate of Amendment”), and (ii) an amendment to the RumbleOn, Inc. 2017 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”) to increase the authorized shares of Class B Common Stock available under the Incentive Plan from 700,000 shares to 2,700,000 shares and extend the term of the Incentive Plan for an additional ten years.
Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement
In connection with the RideNow Transaction, on March 12, 2021, the Company entered into a registration rights and lock-up agreement, by and among the Company and certain equity holders of the Acquired Companies (the “Registration Rights Agreement”). Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement (i) the Company agreed to file a resale registration statement for the Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) no later than thirty (30) days following the Closing, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause it to become effective as promptly as practicable following such filing, (ii) the equity holders were granted certain piggyback registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the Closing, and (iii) the Lock-Up Holders (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) agreed, subject to certain customary exceptions, not to sell, transfer or dispose of any Company common stock for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days from the Closing.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, impacting our reported results of operations and financial condition.
Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management, which have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the recognition of income and expenses. Management considers these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The significant accounting policies and estimates which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are described below. Refer to Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more detailed information regarding our critical accounting policies.
Revenue Recognition
We adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. ASC 606 prescribes a five-step model that includes: (1) identify the contract; (2) identify the performance obligations; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied. Based on the manner in which we historically recognized revenue, the adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material impact on the amount or timing of our revenue recognition, and we recognized no cumulative effect adjustment upon adoption.
For vehicles sold at wholesale to dealers we satisfy our performance obligation for vehicles sales when the wholesale purchaser obtains control of the underlying vehicle, which is upon delivery when the transfer of title, risks and rewards of ownership and control pass to the dealer. We recognize revenue at the amount we expect to receive for the pre-owned vehicle, which is the fixed price determined at the auction. The purchase price of the wholesale vehicle is typically due and collected within 30 days of delivery of the wholesale vehicle.
For vehicles sold to consumers the purchase price is set forth in the customer contracts at a stand-alone selling price which is agreed upon prior to delivery. We satisfy our performance obligation for pre-owned vehicle sales upon delivery when the transfer of title, risks and rewards of ownership and control pass to the customer. We recognize revenue at the agreed upon purchase price stated in the contract, including any delivery charges, less an estimate for returns. Our return policy allows customers to initiate a return during the first three days after delivery. Estimates for returns are based on an analysis of historical experience, trends and sales data. Changes in these estimates are reflected as an adjustment to revenue in the period identified. The amount of consideration received for pre-owned vehicle sales to consumers includes noncash consideration representing the value of trade-in vehicles, if applicable, as stated in the contract. Prior to the delivery of the vehicle, the payment is received, or financing has been arranged. Payments from customers that finance their purchases with third parties are typically due and collected within 30 days of delivery of the pre-owned vehicle. In future periods additional provisions may be necessary due to a variety of factors, including changing customer return patterns due to the maturation of the online vehicle buying market, macro- and micro-economic factors that could influence customer return behavior and future pricing environments. If these factors result in adjustments to sales returns, they could significantly impact our future operating results. Revenue exclude any sales taxes, title and registration fees, and other government fees that are collected from customers.
Vehicle logistics and transportation services revenue is generated primarily by entering into freight brokerage agreements with dealers, distributors, or private party individuals to transport vehicles from a point of origin to a designated destination. The transaction price is based on the consideration specified in the customer's contract. A performance obligation is created when the customer under a transportation contract submits a bill of lading for the transport of goods from origin to destination. These performance obligations are satisfied as the shipments move from origin to destination. The freight brokerage agreements are fulfilled by independent third-party transporters. While the Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling to customers, these transporters are obligated to meet our performance obligations and standards. Performance obligations are short-term, with transit days less than one week. Generally, customers are billed either upon shipment of the vehicle or on a monthly basis, and remit payment according to approved payment terms, generally not to exceed 30 days. Revenue is recognized as risks and rewards of transportation of the vehicle is transferred to the owner during delivery. Wholesale Express is considered the principal in the delivery transactions since it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the service. As a result, revenue is recorded gross.
Valuation of Inventory
Pre-owned vehicle inventory is accounted for pursuant to ASC 330, Inventory and consists of pre-owned vehicles primarily acquired from consumers and includes the cost to acquire and recondition a pre-owned vehicle. Reconditioning costs are billed by third-party providers and includes parts, labor, and other repair expenses directly attributable to a specific vehicle. Transportation costs are expensed as incurred. Pre-owned inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Vehicle inventory cost is determined by specific identification. Net realizable value is based on the estimated selling price less costs to complete, dispose and transport the vehicles. Selling prices are derived from historical data and trends, such as sales price and inventory turn data of similar vehicles, as well as independent market resources. Each reporting period, the Company recognizes any necessary adjustments to reflect pre-owned vehicle inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which is recognized in cost of revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of December 31, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist.
We have three reportable segments as defined in generally accepted accounting principles for segment reporting: (1) powersports, (2) automotive and (3) vehicle logistics and transportation. Each of these segments are considered separate reporting units for purposes of goodwill testing. In performing our annual goodwill impairment test, we first review qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing qualitative factors, we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the quantitative test is unnecessary and our goodwill is not considered to be impaired. However, if based on the qualitative assessment we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if we elect to bypass the optional qualitative assessment as provided for under GAAP, we proceed with performing the quantitative impairment test.
Due to the significant decline in the Company’s stock price and the economic effect of COVID-19, the Company determined a triggering event for Goodwill impairment existed as of March 31, 2020. As a result, the Company performed a quantitative impairment analysis for the Automotive segment. The Company’s impairment test indicated no impairment existed as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value at March 31, 2020. In connection with its annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2020, the Company performed impairment assessments by reviewing qualitative factors for each of its reporting units. The results of the assessments indicated that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units were greater than the carrying values and no goodwill impairment was determined to exist for the years ended December 31, 2020.
In connection with its annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2019 for the three reporting units we performed quantitative impairment testing of the fair value of our reporting units using an income and market valuation approach. The income valuation approach estimates our enterprise value using a net present value model, which discounts projected free cash flows of our business using the weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate. We also validated the fair value for each reporting unit using the income approach by calculating a cash earnings multiple and determining whether the multiple was reasonable compared to recent market transactions completed in the industry. As part of that assessment, we also reconcile the estimated aggregate fair values of our reporting units to our market capitalization. We believe this reconciliation process is consistent with a market participant perspective. This consideration would also include a control premium that represents the estimated amount an investor would pay for our equity securities to obtain a controlling interest, and other significant assumptions including revenue and profitability growth, profit margins, residual values and the cost of capital. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized an impairment loss on goodwill of $1,850,000 related to powersports, which is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. No goodwill impairment resulted from the quantitative impairments tests of the remaining reporting units as of December 31, 2019.
Newly Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting pronouncement (FASB ASU 2016-02) related to the accounting for leases. This pronouncement requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheet while also disclosing key information about those lease arrangements. Under the new guidance, lease classification as either a finance lease or an operating lease will affect the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement. The classification criteria to distinguish between finance and operating leases are generally consistent with the classification criteria to distinguish between capital and operating leases under existing lease accounting guidance. This pronouncement is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. We adopted the new standard for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2019.
