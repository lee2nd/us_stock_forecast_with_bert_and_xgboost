Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The following discussions are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Going Concern Considerations
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which contemplate continuation of our Company as a going concern. We currently have no revenues, have incurred net losses, and have an accumulated deficit of $178,753 as of December 31, 2020. The continuation of our Company as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise equity or debt financing, and the attainment of profitable operations from any future business we may acquire. There are no assurances that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient capital to continue as a going concern. If our working capital needs are not met and we are unable to obtain adequate capital, we could be forced to cease operations.
Use of Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Intellectual Property
We have patent and patent pending technologies with a focus on artificial intelligence (“AI”), machine learning with optimization and Smart Deployment algorithms. It involves anticipating demand for passengers and dispatching cars in advance - to reduce wait-time, increasing utilization of vehicles, and decrease cost. It includes new and efficient system for tracking and charging customers with preferred rates, supply and demand rates, and “specific” community engagement.
Patent expenses, consisting mainly of patent filing fees, have been capitalized and are shown as an asset on our balance sheet. We amortize our Patent asset over the remaining life of the Patent, which is approximately ten (10) years.
Long-lived Assets
We follow ASC 360-10-15-3, Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets, which established a “primary asset” approach to determine the cash flow estimation period for a group of assets and liabilities that represents the unit of accounting for a long-lived asset to be held and used. Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
Common Stock Issued for Services
Our accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services, codified into ASC 505 Equity. The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or (ii) the date at which the consultant or vendor's performance is complete. In the case of equity instruments issued to consultants, the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized over the term of the consulting agreement at various performance completion dates, and for unvested instruments, at each reporting date. Compensation expense, once recorded, may not be reversed.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position and result of operations.
Trends and Uncertainties
Demand for our products is dependent on general economic conditions, which are cyclical in nature. Because a major portion of our activities are the receipt of revenues from our services and products, our business operations may be adversely affected by competitors and prolonged recessionary periods.
There are no other known trends, events or uncertainties that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our short-term or long-term liquidity. Sources of liquidity will come from the sale of our products and services. There are no material commitments for capital expenditure at this time. There are no trends, events or uncertainties that have had or are reasonably expected to have a material impact on the net sales or revenues or income from continuing operations. There are no significant elements of income or loss that do not arise from the registrant’s continuing operations. There are no other known causes for any material changes from period to period in one or more line items of our financial statements.
Impact of COVID-19
During the year 2020, the effects of a new coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and related actions to attempt to control its spread began to impact our business. The impact of COVID-19 on our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020 was limited, in all material respects, due to the government mandated numerous measures, including closures of businesses, limitations on movements of individuals and goods, and the imposition of other restrictive measures, in its efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 within the country.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Governments around the world have mandated, and continue to introduce, orders to slow the transmission of the virus, including but not limited to shelter-in-place orders, quarantines, significant restrictions on travel, as well as work restrictions that prohibit many employees from going to work. Uncertainty with respect to the economic effects of the pandemic has introduced significant volatility in the financial markets.
Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019
For both years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no revenues.
Our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $37,296 compared to $22,600 or the year ended December 31, 2019. The 2019 period included $20,000 in professional fees for the issuance of common stock to consultants for assisting with the Tribal Rides asset purchase. In the 2020 period, we incurred the following expenses which we did not incur in the 2019 period: legal and accounting fees of $11,385, other professional fees of $8,625, filing fees of $3,088, rent of $4,740 telephone of $2,820 and advertising and promotion of $1,260.
Our other expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of interest expense of $2,000 which was the same for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, in the 2019 period we recorded a gain on the extinguishment of accounts payable of $620.
Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $39,296 ($0.00 per share) compares to a net loss of $23,980 ($0.00 per share) in the previous year.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have previously raised capital through debt financing, advances from related parties and private placements of our common stock to meet operating needs. As of December 31, 2020, we have no cash, and we will need to raise additional funds to execute our current plan of operation. We currently have no written commitment from anyone to contribute funds to our Company. If we are unable to raise sufficient funds to execute our plan of operation, we intend to scale back our operations commensurately with the funds available to us. If we are unable to obtain adequate capital, we could be forced to cease operations.
We have no plant or significant equipment to sell, nor are we going to buy any plant or significant equipment during the next 12 months.
Balance Sheets
As of December 31, 2020, we had no cash and total assets of $3,273 compared with no assets as of December 31, 2019. Our total liabilities increase in the 2020 period compared to 2019 by $38,932 due to increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as well as related party advances.
During the year ended December 31, 2020 we issued 25,000,000 shares of our common stock in connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement.
Cash Flows
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we used no cash for operating activities. In addition, there were no cash flows from investing activities or financing activities in either the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources.
Emerging Growth Company
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. Certain specified reduced reporting and other regulatory requirements that are available to public companies that are emerging growth companies include:
1. an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
2. an exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies;
3. an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about our audit and our financial statements; and
4. reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements.
We have elected to take advantage of the exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to public companies required to adopt these new requirements.
