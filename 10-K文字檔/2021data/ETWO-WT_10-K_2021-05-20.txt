Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This item contains a discussion of our business, including a general overview of our properties, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page 64. This Item 7 contains “forward-looking” statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See Forward-Looking Statements at the beginning of this 2021 Form 10-K.
Our fiscal year end is the final day in February. Our fiscal years 2021 and 2020 ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, respectively, and were each fifty-two-week periods.
Overview
We are a leading provider of 100% cloud-based, end-to-end SCM software. Our software combines networks, data and applications to provide a deeply embedded, mission-critical platform that allows customers to optimize their supply chain by accelerating growth, reducing costs, increasing visibility and driving improved resiliency. Given the mission-critical nature of our solutions, we maintain deep, long-term relationships with our customers, which is reflected by our gross retention and customer tenure. In aggregate, we serve more than 1,200 customers in over 180 countries across a wide range of end-markets, including technology, consumer, industrial and transportation, among others.
We operate in what we believe is an attractive industry with strong secular tailwinds and a large TAM of more than $45 billion. This TAM is comprised of significant whitespace, which we estimate is more than $1 billion. This opportunity within our existing customer base is largely driven by their current technology solution which is often aa combination of legacy point solutions and home-grown applications, which are tied together with manual processes and spreadsheets. As manufacturing has evolved from brands owning the full production lifecycle to orchestrating disparate manufacturing, distribution and selling processes, supply chains have grown more complex, increasing demand for software solutions like ours and the need to modernize the existing technology landscape with cloud-based modern solutions. We believe our fully cloud-based, end-to-end software platform offers a differentiated solution for customers that gives them significantly better value as compared to solutions offered by some of our competitors.
Our Go-To-Market Strategy
Our go-to-market strategy is focused on both expanding the adoption of our product portfolio with existing customers and the acquisition of new customers. We primarily focus our selling efforts on large enterprise organizations and sell our software through a direct sales force and channel partners. Additionally, we have a high-velocity inside sales organization to serve small and medium-sized businesses. Our go-to-market strategy enables our sales force to develop deep, long-term relationships with existing and potential customers across the relevant functions, from buying managers, IT resources, division leaders and C-level executives. Importantly, we believe that our go-to-market approach focused on customers is a competitive advantage compared to competitors whose go-to-market approach is often focused on products. We believe this enables us to sustain our high customer retention and long customer tenure as well as drive maximum spend within each customer.
Our sales organization is comprised of field sales, inside sales and sales development personnel, and we align these teams based on customer size and industry. We focus initially on solving a customer’s primary need, usually a specific piece of their supply chain. Once a customer adopts our solution and witnesses the power of our unique platform, we focus on cross-selling additional products and up-selling additional departments, divisions and geographies with the same solution. We have found that experience with our SaaS platform is the most effective selling tool.
The Business Combination
On February 4, 2021, E2open Holdings and CCNB1 completed the Business Combination contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, CCNB1 acquired a majority interest in E2open Holdings through a series of mergers, with E2open Holdings becoming a direct subsidiary of CCNB1. In connection with the completion of the Business Combination, CCNB1 changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from the Cayman Islands to the State of Delaware and changed its name to “E2open Parent Holdings, Inc.”
Upon completion of the Business Combination, CCNB1 was deemed the accounting acquirer and E2open the accounting acquiree. Under the acquisition method of accounting, CCNB1’s assets and liabilities retained their carrying values and the assets and liabilities associated with E2open Holdings were recorded at their fair values measured as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The cash consideration in the Business Combination included cash from (1) the Trust Account in the amount of $414.0 million, (2) $525.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of a new term loan, (3) $695.0 million in proceeds from the PIPE Investment and (4) $200.0 million in proceeds from Forward Purchase Agreement. These proceeds were used to pay (x) $601.1 million in cash consideration payable to certain equity owners and option holders of E2open Holdings, including certain non-recurring seller transaction expenses, (y) $978.5 million of existing E2open debt and accrued interest and (z) total non-recurring transaction costs of $105.2 million. The non-recurring transaction costs included acquisition-related advisory fees in connection with the Business Combination, deferred underwriting commissions in connection with CCNB1’s IPO and debt issuance costs related to the new credit agreement entered into in connection with the Business Combination but excluded certain seller costs to be paid by the equity owners of E2open Holdings. The deferred underwriting commissions and costs pertaining to the reverse merger were treated as a reduction of equity while merger-related costs were expensed in the period in which the Business Combination closed. The debt issuance costs were capitalized as a reduction to the outstanding debt balances. In addition, certain options to purchase equity interests in E2open Holdings were accelerated upon the Closing Date, which resulted in a non-recurring expense of approximately $28.2 million in the period from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021. Additionally, unit-based compensation expense of $4.7 million was recognized during the period from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 related to the restricted Series B-1 and B-2 common stock issued in connection with the Business Combination for the accelerated unvested options and restricted units.
As a result of the Business Combination, our financial results are broken out between the Predecessor period (March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021) and the Successor period (February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021).
Impact of COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused business disruptions worldwide beginning in January 2020. The full extent to which the pandemic will impact our business, operations, cash flows and financial condition will depend on future developments that are difficult to accurately predict. We have experienced modest adverse impacts as it relates to lengthening of sales cycles and delays in delivering professional services and training to our customers.
Although parts of our business have seemingly returned to pre-pandemic levels, the recent surge in COVID-19, specifically in India. demonstrates that the impact of the pandemic is not yet complete. The global pandemic continues to evolve, and we are carefully monitoring the situation to understand its impacts on our business and operations.
Key Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenue
Effective March 1, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), and all the related amendments, using the modified retrospective method. We adopted the new standard for all customer contracts. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
We generate revenue from the sale of subscriptions and professional services. We recognize revenue when the customer contract and associated performance obligations have been identified; the transaction price has been determined and allocated to the performance obligations in the contract; and the performance obligations have been satisfied.
Subscription Revenue
We offer cloud-based on-demand software solutions, which enable our customers to have constant access to our solutions without the need to manage and support the software and associated hardware themselves. We house the hardware and software in third-party facilities and provide our customers with access to the software solutions, along with data security and storage, backup, recovery services and solution support. Our customer contracts typically have a term of three to five years. We primarily invoice our customers for subscriptions in advance for the annual use of the software solutions. Our payment terms typically require customers to pay within 30 to 90 days from the invoice date.
We also offer applications which enable our customers to have access to an electronic commerce transaction platform for the international container shipping industry. We charge either fixed annual subscription fees or volume-based transaction fees based on the volume of transactions booked on the platform for this product. For subscription-based contracts, we generally invoice annually in advance. Under the previous standard, we limited subscription revenue recognition to the contractually billable amounts in each year of the subscription. Under the new standard, subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the life of the contract. The impact of this change was insignificant; therefore, no cumulative adjustment was made to the opening balance sheet for revenue recognition at the adoption of the new standard. For transactional based contracts, we primarily recognize revenue and invoices for these transactions monthly once incurred. This is unchanged from the previous standard. Transaction based contracts represented less than 3% of our revenue in the combined Successor and Predecessor periods in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021.
Professional Services
Professional services revenue is derived primarily from fees for enabling services, including solution consulting and solution deployment. These services are often sold in conjunction with the sale of our solutions. We provide professional services primarily on a time and materials basis, but also on a fixed fee basis. Customers are invoiced for professional services either monthly in arrears or, as with fixed fee arrangements, in advance and upon reaching project milestones. Professional services revenue is recognized over time. For services that are contracted at a fixed price, progress is generally measured based on labor hours incurred as a percentage of the total estimated hours required for complete satisfaction of the related performance obligations. For services that are contracted on time and materials or a prepaid basis, progress is generally based on actual labor hours expended. These input methods (e.g., hours incurred or expended) are considered a faithful depiction of our efforts to satisfy services contracts as they represent the performance obligation consumed by the customer and performed by us, and therefore reflect the transfer of services to a customer under contract. The adoption of the new standard did not result in a material change to the revenue recognition of professional services.
We enter into arrangements with multiple performance obligations comprised of subscriptions and professional services. Arrangements with customers typically do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of the software supporting the on-demand solutions. We primarily account for subscription and professional services revenue as separate units of accounting and allocate revenue to each deliverable in an arrangement based on a standalone selling price. We evaluate the standalone selling price for each element by considering prices we charge for similar offerings, size of the order and historical pricing practices.
Total Revenue by Geographic Locations
Revenues by geographical region consisted of the following:
Revenues by geography are determined based on the region of our contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the customer. Americas revenue attributed to the United States was approximately 96%, 96%, 96% and 98% during the periods from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 and March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021 and fiscal years ended February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019, respectively. No other country represented more than ten percent of total revenue during these periods.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of Subscription Revenue
Cost of subscription revenue consists primarily of costs related to delivering our service and providing support to customers, including personnel and related costs, costs associated with data center capacity, fees paid to third parties to license their technology and depreciation expense directly related to delivering our solutions. We generally expense our cost of subscription revenue as we incur the costs.
Cost of Professional Services Revenue
Cost of professional services revenue consists primarily of personnel and related travel costs, the costs of contracted third-party vendors and reimbursable expenses. As our personnel are employed on a full-time basis, our cost of professional services is largely fixed in the short-term, while our professional services revenue may fluctuate, leading to fluctuations in professional services gross profit. We expense our cost of professional services revenue as we incur the costs.
Operating Expenses
Research and Development
Research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs of our research and development staff, costs of certain third-party contractors, depreciation, amortization and other allocated costs. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred, excluding the capitalization of internally developed software costs.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs for our sales and marketing staff. It also includes the costs of promotional events, corporate communications, online marketing, solution marketing and other brand-building activities, in addition to depreciation, amortization and other allocated costs. When the initial customer contract is signed and upon any renewal, we capitalize and amortize commission costs under ASC 606, as an expense over the period in which products are expected to be delivered to customers, where the commission is directly attributable to a contract, including expected renewals, which is estimated to be four years. If a subscription agreement is terminated, we recognize the unamortized portion of any deferred commission cost as an expense immediately upon such termination. Certain sales commissions are contingent on future customer billings and are expensed as incurred to sales and marketing expense.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs for our executive, administrative, finance, information technology, legal, accounting, investor relations and human resource staff. It also includes professional fees; expenses related to our board of directors; public company costs; other corporate expenses; depreciation; amortization; and other allocated costs.
Interest and Other Expense, Net
Interest and other expense, net, consists primarily of interest income on our cash balances; interest expense on our outstanding debt and capital lease obligations; foreign currency realized and unrealized gains and losses; and gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets.
Provision for Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods ended February 28, 2021 consists of a deferred income tax benefit and current tax expense. The current income taxes primarily result from our profitable operations in foreign subsidiaries, which are subject to corporate income taxes in foreign jurisdictions, plus a relatively small amount of U.S. federal and state income taxes not offset by net operating loss carryforwards. The deferred income tax benefit is primarily due to a reduction in overall state deferred liabilities resulting from certain state tax law changes, the impact on our effective state tax rates from changes in our transfer pricing policies and increase in state net operating losses in certain jurisdictions, offset by valuation allowances and E2open Parent Holdings, Inc.’s investment in E2open Holdings. The deferred tax assets of certain other U.S corporate tax consolidated groups and non-U.S. jurisdictions remain offset by a valuation allowance. Realization of these deferred tax assets depends upon future earnings, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Utilization of our net operating losses may be subject to annual limitations due to the ownership change rules under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (IRS Code), and similar state provisions. We have analyzed the effect of the IRS Code Section 382 for each of our acquisitions. Based on analysis of acquired net operating losses and credits, utilization of our net operating losses and research and development credits will be subject to annual limitations. In the event we have future changes in ownership, the availability of net operating loss carryforwards could be further limited.
Results of Operations
The following table is our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods indicated:
The comparability of our operating results for the periods from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 and March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021 as compared to the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020 was impacted by the Business Combination in February 2021 and the acquisition of Amber Road in July 2019. In the discussion of our results of operations, we may quantitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services to the extent they remain ascertainable. Expense contributions from our acquisition for the respective period comparisons generally were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations.
February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 (Successor) and March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021 (Predecessor) compared to Fiscal year ended February 29, 2020 (Predecessor)
Revenue
(1)
Change represents the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020.
Subscription revenue was $273.8 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, a $29.8 million, or 12%, increase compared to subscription revenue of $244.0 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. The increase in subscription revenue was primarily related to the acquisition of Amber Road. The balance of the increase was primarily related to new organic subscription sales in the prior periods, predominantly driven by increases in products utilized across our customer portfolio.
Professional services revenue was $56.2 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, a $4.9 million, or 8%, decrease compared to $61.1 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic which delayed the delivery of professional services and training to our customers, mainly due to our customers’ focus on switching to remote operations during the first half of fiscal 2021, which began on March 1, 2021. Importantly, although the COVID-19 pandemic delayed planned customer engagements, we did not experience any material cancellations of engagements. Professional services revenue was also impacted by fewer new subscription sales closed in early fiscal 2021 as compared to the fiscal 2020. We attribute this temporary delay in closing new subscription sales to the COVID-19 pandemic as our customers were focused on the impact of the pandemic on their operations rather than launching new technology projects.
Our subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased to 83% for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 compared to 80% for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020 driven primarily by the increase in subscription revenue and decline in professional services revenue described above.
Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin
(1)
Change represents the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020.
Cost of subscriptions was $63.4 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, a $4.3 million, or 7%, increase compared to $59.1 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. This increase is primarily related to the acquisition of Amber Road and $2.5 million of unit-based compensation recognized related to the acceleration of unvested options and restricted units of E2open Holdings in connection with the Business Combination, partially offset by the realization of acquisition-related cost savings from acquisitions.
Cost of professional services revenue was $44.8 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, a $2.4 million, or 6%, increase compared to $42.4 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. This increase is primarily related to the acquisition of Amber Road and $0.7 million unit-based compensation recognized related to the acceleration of unvested options and restricted units of E2open Holdings in connection with the Business Combination. We have proactively decided to invest in our professional services organization during the COVID-19 pandemic as a means of providing additional service to and deeper relationships with our customers.
Amortization of acquired intangible assets was $23.0 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, a $3.4 million, or 18%, increase compared to $19.5 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020, driven primarily by additional intangibles from the acquisition of Amber Road and the reevaluation of the intangible assets as part of the Business Combination in February 2021.
Our subscriptions gross margin remained consistent at 68% for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal years ended February 28, 2021 and the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. Our professional services gross margin declined to 20% for fiscal 2021 from 31% in the fiscal 2020, primarily due to lower professional services revenue in the current period as described above.
Research and Development
(1)
Change represents the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020.
Research and development expenses were $64.2 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, a $2.4 million, or 4%, increase compared to $61.9 million in the prior year. The increase is due to $5.2 million of additional unit-based compensation expense recognized related to the acceleration of unvested options and restricted units of E2open Holdings in connection with the Business Combination, partially offset by leveraging the existing E2open operating model and managerial structure resulting in cost savings associated with the acquisition of Amber Road.
Sales and Marketing
(1)
Change represents the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020.
Sales and marketing expenses were $54.8 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, a $1.2 million, or 2%, increase compared to $53.6 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily related to $5.1 million of additional unit-based compensation recognized related to the acceleration of unvested options and restricted units of E2open Holdings in connection with the Business Combination and associated costs of the Amber Road acquisition, partially offset by the realization of acquisition-related cost savings from historical acquisitions.
General and Administrative
(1)
Change represents the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020.
General and administrative expenses were $60.5 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, a $8.7 million, or 17%, increase compared to $51.8 million in the prior year. The increase is driven primarily by $14.7 million of additional unit-based compensation recognized related to the acceleration of unvested options and restricted units of E2open Holdings in connection with the Business Combination and $4.7 million unit-based compensation for the restricted Series B-1 and B-2 common stock issued in connection with the Business Combination for the accelerated unvested options and restricted units during fiscal 2021. These increases were partially offset by the $9.5 million of unit-based compensation attributable to the acceleration of certain unit-based awards in connection with the Amber Road acquisition during fiscal 2020, as well as the realization of acquisition-related cost savings from historical acquisitions.
Other Operating Expenses
(1)
Change represents the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020.
Other operating expenses were $51.2 million for combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal 2021, a $6.7 million, or 11%, decrease compared to $57.8 million in the prior year. The decrease is mainly due to the significant transaction related expenses incurred in fiscal 2020 for Amber Road.
Interest and Other Expense, Net
(1)
Change represents the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020.
Interest expense increased to $67.4 million for combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal 2021, a $0.2 million decrease compared to $67.6 million in the prior year. This decrease is driven primarily by the incremental debt incurred to finance the acquisition of Amber Road, partially offset by the reduction in outstanding debt as well as the associated interest rate on the debt refinanced in the Business Combination and other income earned during fiscal 2021.
In connection with the Business Combination, we repaid the full outstanding principal balance of $907.3 million of the Term Loan Due 2024, as defined below, using proceeds from the Business Combination. Additionally, we entered into a new $525.0 million term loan and a $75.0 million revolver in connection with the Business Combination. See Debt below for additional details.
Gain from Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability
We recorded a gain of $23.2 million during the period from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 for the change in fair value on the revaluation of our warrant liability associated with our public, private placement and forward purchase warrants. We are required to revalue the warrants at the end of each reporting period and reflect in the Consolidated Statements of Operations a gain or loss from the change in fair value of the warrant liability in the period in which the change occurred. We did not have outstanding warrants prior to the Business Combination.
Gain from Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration
We recorded a gain of $33.7 million during the period from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 for the change in fair value on the revaluation of our contingent consideration associated with our restricted Series B-1 and B-2 common stock and Sponsor Side Letter. We are required to revalue the contingent consideration at the end of each reporting period and reflect in the Consolidated Statements of Operations a gain or loss from the change in fair value of the contingent consideration in the period in which the change occurred.
Provision for Income Taxes
(1)
Change represents the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020.
Loss before income taxes is $42.4 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, a $66.3 million, or 61%, decrease compared to $108.6 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. This decrease is related primarily to the acquisition of Amber Road, stronger operating results, the $9.5 million unit-based compensation recognized in fiscal 2020 attributable to the acceleration of certain unit-based awards related to the Amber Road acquisition, additional integration-related cost savings realized from historical acquisitions, $23.2 million income for the fair value adjustment as of February 28, 2021 for the warrant liability and $33.7 million income associated with the fair value adjustment as of February 28, 2021 for the contingent consideration liability related to the Sponsor Side Letter and restricted Series B-1 and B-2 common stock. The benefits were partially offset by higher interest expense in fiscal 2020 due to incremental debt incurred to finance the Amber Road acquisition, $28.2 million of unit-based compensation expense related to the acceleration of unvested options and restricted units of E2open Holdings in connection with the Business Combination and $4.7 million of unit-based compensation expense for the restricted Series B-1 and B-2 common stock issued in connection with the Business Combination for the accelerated unvested options and restricted units.
Notwithstanding that the $7.3 million income tax benefit is substantially the same for each period, the effective tax rate is 17.2% for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, compared 6.2%, for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. The overall increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the relative change in state taxes, earnings at affiliate, changes in valuation allowances and changes due to the fair value of equity compensation related to the Business Combination.
Fiscal year ended February 29, 2020 compared to Fiscal year ended February 28, 2019
Revenue
Subscription revenue was $244.0 million in fiscal year 2020, a $90.4 million, or 59%, increase compared to $153.6 million in fiscal year 2019. The increase in subscription revenue was primarily related to the acquisitions of INTTRA and Amber Road. The balance of the increase was primarily related to new organic subscription sales in the prior periods, predominantly driven by increases in products utilized across our customer portfolio. The impact of changes in price per product has not been material. As customers become larger, our pricing model recognizes various factors such as number of products purchased and the penetration of those products within a customer’s operations. As such, when a customer buys more product, their average cost per product may decline even though total revenue from that customer may increase.
Professional services revenue was $61.1 million in fiscal year 2020, a $13.5 million, or 28%, increase compared to $47.6 million in fiscal year 2019. This increase was primarily related to the acquisitions of INTTRA and Amber Road. The balance of the increase was primarily related to additional professional services revenue related to the new organic subscription sales in the prior periods.
Subscription revenue increased to 80% of total revenue for our fiscal year ending February 29, 2020 from 76% in the comparable prior year period. This increase is primarily related to the acquisitions of INTTRA and Amber Road, which had relatively higher subscription revenue as a percentage of their respective total revenue bases.
Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Cost of subscriptions was $59.1 million in fiscal year 2020, a $25.6 million, or 76%, increase compared to fiscal year 2019. The increase was primarily related to the acquisitions of INTTRA and Amber Road, partially offset by the realization of integration-related cost savings from historical acquisitions.
Cost of professional services was $42.4 million in fiscal year 2020, a $10.7 million, or 34%, increase compared to fiscal year 2019. This increase was primarily related to the acquisitions of INTTRA and Amber Road, partially offset by the realization of integration-related cost savings from historical acquisitions.
Amortization of intangible assets increased to $19.5 million in fiscal year 2020 compared to $8.4 million in fiscal year 2019. This increase was primarily due to additional amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired from INTTRA and Amber Road.
Subscription gross margin declined from 73% in fiscal year 2019 to 68% in fiscal year 2020, primarily related to the acquisitions of INTTRA and Amber Road and the timing of realizing integration-related cost savings driven by these acquisitions.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses were $61.9 million in fiscal year 2020, a $19.4 million, or 46%, increase compared to fiscal year 2019, related primarily to the acquisitions of INTTRA and Amber Road as well as organic investments made in incremental research and development headcount.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses were $53.6 million in fiscal year 2020, a $19.2 million, or 56%, increase compared to $34.4 million in fiscal year 2019, related primarily to the acquisitions of INTTRA and Amber Road as well as organic investments made in sales and marketing activities.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses were $51.8 million in fiscal year 2020, a $23.8 million, or 85%, increase compared to $28.0 million in fiscal year 2019. This increase is primarily related to the acquisitions of INTTRA and Amber Road as well as unit-based compensation expense associated with the Amber Road acquisition, which is the result of the acceleration of certain employee equity incentives post-closing.
Other Operating Expenses
Other operating expenses increased to $57.8 million in fiscal year 2020 compared to $35.7 million in fiscal year 2019, primarily related to transaction fees and expenses, integration costs and intangible assets related to the acquisitions of INTTRA and Amber Road Other operating expense in fiscal 2020 were mainly due to the acquisition of Amber Road while fiscal 2019 were primarily due to the acquisition of INTTRA.
Interest and Other Expense, Net
Interest expense was $67.6 million in fiscal year 2020, a $46.7 million increase compared to $20.8 million in fiscal year 2019, primarily related to incremental debt incurred with respect to the 2019 acquisition of INTTRA resulting in a full year of interest expense followed by an additional increase in debt for the 2020 acquisition of Amber Road.
In fiscal year 2019, we repaid the full outstanding principal balance of $153.1 million of a term loan and credit facility using proceeds from the Term Loan Due 2024, as defined below. In connection with the repayment, we paid a $3.1 million prepayment fee and wrote off unamortized debt issuance costs of $1.5 million.
Provision for Income Taxes
Loss before income taxes was $108.7 million in fiscal year 2020, a $70.3 million increase compared to a net loss of $38.4 million in fiscal year 2019, related primarily to one-time expenses related to the acquisitions of INTTRA and Amber Road. The income tax benefit for fiscal year 2020 primarily relates to a reduction in deferred tax liabilities associated with the amortization of acquired intangible assets. The fiscal year 2019 benefit was driven primarily by an uncertain tax position release in that year based on the expiration of a statute of limitations.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This document includes Non-GAAP revenue, Non-GAAP subscription revenue, Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP gross margin and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP performance measures that we use to supplement our results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by security analysts, institutional investors and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of performance of other companies in other industries or within the same industry.
We calculate and define Non-GAAP revenue as revenue excluding the impact of the deferred revenue fair value adjustment recorded as part of the purchase accounting associated with the Business Combination on our results of operations and balance sheet. We calculate and define Non-GAAP subscription revenue as subscription revenue excluding the deferred revenue fair value adjustment. We calculate and define Non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit excluding deferred revenue fair value adjustment, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation and certain other non-cash and non-recurring items. We define and calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income or losses excluding interest income or expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and further adjusted for the following items: deferred revenue fair value adjustment, share-based compensation, transaction-related costs and certain other non-cash and non-recurring items as described in the reconciliation below. We also report Non-GAAP gross profit and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Non-GAAP revenue as additional measures to evaluate financial performance.
We include these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by management to evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and new investments. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain expenses that are required in accordance with U.S. GAAP because they are non-recurring (for example, in the case of transaction-related costs and deferred revenue fair value adjustment), non-cash (for example, in the case of depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation and deferred revenue fair value adjustment) or are not related to our underlying business performance (for example, in the case of interest income and expense). There are limitations to non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in the U.S. GAAP financial presentation. The items excluded from U.S. GAAP financial measures such as net income or loss to arrive at non-GAAP financial measures are significant components for understanding and assessing our financial performance. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not alternatives to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
We measure liquidity in terms of our ability to fund the cash requirements of our business operations, including working capital, capital expenditure needs, contractual obligations and other commitments, with cash flows from operations and other sources of funding. Current working capital needs relate mainly to employee compensation and benefits, as well as interest and debt. Our ability to expand and grow our business will depend on many factors, including working capital needs and the evolution of our operating cash flows.
We had $194.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and $75.0 million of unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility as of February 28, 2021. See Note 12, Notes Payable and Capital Lease Obligations to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operating activities and, if necessary, the borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, debt repayment and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months.
In the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses. To facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing.
Debt
2021 Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility
On February 4, 2021, as part of the Business Combination, E2open, LLC entered into a new $525.0 million term loan (2021 Term Loan) and a $75.0 million revolver (2021 Revolving Credit Facility). The 2021 Term Loan will mature on February 4, 2028 while the revolver will mature on February 4, 2026. The 2021 Term Loan has a variable interest rate which was 3.69% as of February 28, 2021. Principal payments of $1.3 million are due on the last day of each February, May, August and November commencing August 2021. As of February 28, 2021, the 2021 Term Loan had a principal balance outstanding of $525.0 million and there were no amounts drawn on the revolver.
Amber Term Loan
In July 2019, E2open Holdings incurred an additional term loan with Silicon Valley Bank (Amber Term Loan) with a maturity date of April 2021. The loan had a variable interest rate which was 3.25% as of February 29, 2020. As of February 29, 2020, the loan had a principal amount outstanding of $36.6 million. On February 4, 2021, this debt was paid in full as part of the Business Combination.
Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility Due 2024
In November 2018, E2open, LLC entered into a credit agreement, including an initial term loan of $400.0 million, delayed draw term loans of up to $80.0 million (together, Term Loan Due 2024) and a revolving credit facility of up to $30.0 million (Revolving Credit Facility) with a maturity date of November 2024. Borrowings under the Term Loan Due 2024 during the year ended February 29, 2020 were $441.0 million and were used for the acquisition of Amber Road. There were $15.0 million outstanding under the
Revolving Credit Facility as of February 29, 2020. The interest rate for the Term Loan Due 2024 and Revolving Credit Facility was 7.7% as of February 29, 2020. On February 4, 2021, all outstanding balances on the Term Loan Due 2024 and Revolving Credit Facility were repaid in full as part of the Business Combination.
Repayment of Credit Facility
In November 2018, we repaid the full outstanding principal balance of $153.1 million of a term loan and credit facility using proceeds from the Term Loan Due 2024. In connection with the repayment, we paid a $3.1 million prepayment fee and wrote off unamortized debt issuance costs of $1.5 million. These charges are included in loss on extinguishment of debt in the accompanying statements of comprehensive loss.
Cash Flows
The following table presents net cash from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities:
February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 (Successor) and March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021 (Predecessor) compared to Fiscal year ended February 29, 2020
As of February 28, 2021, our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $207.5 million, a $159.1 million increase from our balance of $48.4 million as of February 29, 2020, which as primarily due to the Business Combination.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 was $14.5 million compared to a use of cash of $55.8 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. The $70.3 million difference was largely driven by the increase in EBITDA for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020.
Net cash used in investing activities was $481.3 million and $443.0 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 and fiscal year ended February 29, 2020, respectively. The use of cash for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods in 2021 was primarily driven by the Business Combination and acquisition of property and software related to our data centers while the use of cash for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020 was primarily driven by the acquisition of Amber Road.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 was $626.0 million compared to $467.6 million for fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was a result of $158.3 million of cash received from the PIPE Investors above the additional borrowings in 2020 compared to 2021. Additionally, in 2020, we incurred debt issuance costs of $12.9 million. Debt issuance costs were incurred during the period from February 4 through February 28, 2021 as part of the Business Combination.
Fiscal year ended February 29, 2020 compared to Fiscal year ended February 28, 2019
For the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020, our consolidated cash and cash equivalents decreased by approximately $31.0 million to $48.4 million as compared to our balance of $79.4 million on February 28, 2019.
Net cash used by operating activities for fiscal year 2020 was $55.8 million compared to $9.8 million of net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2019. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in operating loss of $28.2 million and an increase in working capital related to the acquisition of Amber Road.
Net cash used in investing activities was $443.0 million for fiscal year 2020 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $235.7 million for fiscal year 2019. The increase in cash used in investing activities was attributed primarily to the acquisition of Amber Road. Capital Expenditures were $11.6 million in fiscal year 2020 compared to $2.7 million in fiscal year 2019.
Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2020 was $467.6 million compared to $260.7 million in fiscal year 2019. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to additional debt of $492.6 million, net of original issue discount, borrowed to finance the acquisition of Amber Road.
Tax Receivable Agreement
Concurrently with the completion of the Business Combination, we entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with certain selling equity holders of E2open Holdings. Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement, we will pay the certain sellers, as applicable, 85% of the tax savings that we realize from increases in the tax basis in E2open Holdings’ assets as a result of the sale of E2open Holdings’ equity interests, the future exchange of the Common Units for shares of Class A Common Stock (or cash) pursuant to the Third Company Agreement, certain pre-existing tax attributes of certain sellers and certain other tax benefits related to entering into the Tax Receivable Agreement including tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The term of the Tax Receivable Agreement will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired unless we exercise our right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement for an amount representing the present value of anticipated future tax benefits under the Tax Receivable Agreement or certain other acceleration events occur.
Amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be contingent upon, among other things, our generation of taxable income over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement. If we do not generate sufficient taxable income in the aggregate over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement to utilize the tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement, we would not be required to make the related payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Although the amount of any payments required to be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be significant, the timing of these payments will vary and will generally be limited to one payment per member per year. The amount of such payments is also generally limited to the extent we are unable to utilize the full amount of any tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement in a given period.
We recorded a liability related to the Tax Receivable Agreement of $50.1 million assuming (1) a constant corporate tax rate of 24.11%, (2) no dispositions of corporate subsidiaries, (3) no material changes in tax law and (4) we do not elect an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, due to the uncertainty of various factors, including: (a) the timing and value of future exchanges, (b) the amount and timing of our future taxable income, (c) changes in our tax rate, (d) no future dispositions of any corporate stock and (e) changes in the tax law, the likely tax savings we will realize and the resulting amounts we are likely to pay to the E2open Sellers pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement are uncertain.
The liability recorded on the balance sheet does not include an estimate of the amount of payments to be made if certain sellers exchanged their remaining interests in E2open Holdings for our common stock, as this amount is not readily determinable and is dependent on several future variables, including timing of future exchanges, stock price at date of exchange, tax attributes of the individual parties to the exchange and changes in future applicable federal and state tax rates.
In addition, if we exercise our right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement or certain other acceleration events occur, we will be required to make immediate cash payments. Such cash payments will be equal to the present value of the assumed future realized tax benefits based on a set of assumptions and using an agreed upon discount rate, as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement. The early termination payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of those future tax benefits. Such payments will be calculated based on certain assumptions, including that we have sufficient taxable income to utilize the full amount of any tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement over the period specified therein. The payments that we will be required to make will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us, but we expect the cash tax savings we will realize from the utilization of the related tax benefits will exceed the amount of any required payments. If we elected to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement as of February 28, 2021, we estimate our early termination payment would have been approximately $129.3 million in the aggregate under the Tax Receivable Agreement.
In accordance with the Third Company Agreement, we will be entitled to receive quarterly tax distributions from E2open Holdings following the Business Combination, subject to limitations imposed by applicable law and contractual restrictions. The cash received from such tax distributions will first be used by us to satisfy any tax liability and then to make any payments required under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We expect that such tax distributions will be sufficient to fund both our tax liability and the required payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.
Under the Tax Receivable Agreement, we are expecting future gross payments during the fiscal years ending February 2022 of $4.2 million, 2023 of $4.9 million, 2024 of $7.8 million, 2025 of $7.3 million, 2026 of $6.3 million and thereafter of $65.6 million.
Other Commitments
In May 2019, E2open Holdings acquired Averetek, LLC (Averetek), which provides a channel marketing engine enabling customers and their channel partners to plan and execute marketing campaign tactics. As part of the acquisition of Averetek, we provided $2.0 million of the purchase price as contingent consideration which will be earned upon successful attainment of earn-out criteria that extends two-years subsequent to closing. If the earn-out criteria is met, the contingent consideration will be earned in May 2021 and paid in June 2021.
As part of the Amber Road acquisition, equity incentive compensation previously granted to Amber Road employees was converted to deferred cash compensation, whereby employees may vest in cash payments over periods up to four years from the date of acquisition. Vesting is contingent upon continued employment with us. Deferred compensation amounts are calculated based on the price we paid for Amber Road’s stock at acquisition, the strike price of the original grant and the number of former Amber Road shares that would have vested over the period. There was no accrual included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of February 28, 2021 for vested, unpaid Amber Road deferred compensation. Unvested future payments that are contingent upon the continuous employment of participating employees totaled $1.0 million as of February 28, 2021.
Operating Leases
We have non-cancelable operating leases for our office spaces with various expiration dates through August 2027. Under these leases, we are required to make future minimum lease payments during the fiscal years ending February 2022 of $8.5 million, 2023 of $6.5 million, 2024 of $5.6 million, 2025 of $4.2 million, 2026 of $3.2 million and thereafter of $5.4 million.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We are responsible for reimbursement of outstanding obligations related to any letters of credit issued under our $15.0 million available letters of credit accessible under our $75.0 million revolving credit facility. We do not have any other material off-balance sheet arrangements or contingent commitments. There were no outstanding letters of credit or borrowings under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility as of February 28, 2021. There was $15.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of February 29, 2020.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amount of revenue and expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider an accounting judgment, estimate or assumption to be critical when (1) the estimate or assumption is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (2) the use of different judgments, estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Revenue Recognition
Subscription revenue, which primarily consists of fees to provide customers access to our solution, is recognized ratably over the life of the contract. Typically, amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Transaction-related revenue is recognized as the transactions occur.
Professional services revenue is derived primarily from fees for enabling services, including solution consulting and solution deployment. These services are often sold in conjunction with the sale of our solutions. We provide professional services primarily on a time and materials basis, but also on a fixed fee basis. Professional services revenue is recognized as the services are provided. For
services that are contracted at a fixed price, progress is generally measured based on labor hours incurred as a percentage of the total estimated hours required for complete satisfaction of the related performance obligations. For services that are contracted on time and materials or prepaid basis, progress is generally based on actual labor hours expended. These input methods (e.g., hours incurred or expended) are considered a faithful depiction of our efforts to satisfy services contracts as they represent the performance obligation consumed by the customer and performed by us, and therefore reflect the transfer of services to a customer under such contracts.
If our estimate of the total hours required for a performance obligation at a fixed price is inaccurate, then our revenue recognition timing will be impacted as labor hours as a percentage of total estimated hours will be adjusted at the end of the contract resulting in additional or reduced revenue recognized, as needed, to account for the change in hours. Any adjustments should not have a material impact to our financial condition and results of operations.
We enter into arrangements with multiple performance obligations, comprising of subscriptions and professional services. Arrangements with customers typically do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of the software supporting the on-demand solutions. We primarily account for subscription and professional services revenue as separate units of accounting and allocate revenue to each deliverable in an arrangement based on standalone selling price. Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price for each distinct performance obligation. We evaluate the standalone selling price for each element by considering prices we charge for similar offerings, size of the order and historical pricing practices.
Deferred revenue from subscriptions represents amounts collected from, or invoiced to, customers in advance of earning subscription revenue. Typically, we bill our annual subscription fees in advance of providing the service. Deferred revenue from professional services represents revenue for time and material contracts where the revenue is recognized when milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts.
Share-Based Compensation
We measure and recognize compensation expense for all share-based awards at fair value over the requisite service period. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the weighted average fair value of options. For restricted stock grants and certain performance-based awards, fair value is determined as the average price of our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. The determination of fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as by assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.
The expected terms of the options are based on evaluations of historical and expected future employee exercise behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rates at the date of grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the expected life at grant date. Volatility is based on historical and expected future volatility of our Class A Common Stock. We have not historically issued any dividends and do not expect to in the future.
For performance-based awards where the number of shares includes a relative revenue growth modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period, the number of shares earned will depend on which range our total revenue growth falls within over the performance period. The fair value of the performance-based shares with the revenue growth modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. In the period it becomes probable that the minimum threshold specified in the performance-based award will be achieved, we will recognize expense for the proportionate share of the total fair value of the award related to the vesting period that has already lapsed. The remaining fair value of the award is expensed on a straight-line basis over the balance of the vesting period. If we determine that it is no longer probable that we will achieve the minimum performance threshold specified in the award, all of the previously recognized compensation expense will be reversed in the period such determination is made.
We do not estimate forfeitures; therefore, we record compensation costs for all awards and record actual forfeitures as they occur.
If factors change and we employ different assumptions in the determination of the fair value of grants in future periods, the related compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current periods.
Refer to Note 22, Share-Based and Unit-Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our share-based compensation plans.
Unit-Based Compensation
The pre-Business Combination unit-based compensation expense associated with awards to employees and directors was measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards that were expected to vest. For time based awards, the expense was recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which was generally four years. For performance based awards, the
expense was recognized when the performance obligation was probable of occurring. The fair value of options was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which was impacted by the following assumptions:
•
Expected Term - We estimated the expected term, using the simplified method due to limited exercise data, to be the period of time between the date of grant and the midpoint between option vesting and expiration.
•
Expected Volatility - As E2open Holdings’ units were not actively traded, the volatility is based on a benchmark of comparable companies within the SCM software industry.
•
Expected Dividend Yield - The dividend rate used was zero as we did not pay any cash dividends to unit holders.
•
Risk-Free Interest Rate - The interest rates used were based on the implied yield available on constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities with a term equal to the expected term of the options.
•
Estimating the fair value of the underlying units is not necessary post-Business Combination as our shares are traded on the NYSE under the symbol “ETWO.”
The pre-Business Combination grant date fair value of our common stock was typically determined by our board of members with the assistance of management and a third-party valuation specialist. The grant date fair value of our membership units was determined using valuation methodologies which utilized certain assumptions and weighting of factors, including an income based approach, a market based approach and an assumption for a discount for lack of marketability. Application of these valuation methodologies involved the use of estimates, judgment and assumptions that are highly complex and subjective, such as those regarding our expected future revenue, expenses, cash flows, discount rates, market multiples and the selection of comparable companies.
We did not estimate forfeitures. Instead, we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred. Forfeitures were not material the periods from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 and March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021 and fiscal years ended February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019.
Warrant Liability
We have public and private placement warrants as well as warrants available under the Forward Purchase Agreement. We classify as equity any equity-linked contracts that (1) require physical settlement or net-share settlement or (2) give us a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in our own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). We classify as assets or liabilities any equity-linked contracts that (1) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net-cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside our control) or (2) give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement).
For equity-linked contracts that are classified as liabilities, we record the fair value of the equity-linked contract at each balance sheet date and record the change in the statements of operations as a gain (loss) from change in fair value of warrant liability. Our public warrant liability is valued using the binomial lattice pricing model. Our private placement warrants are valued using a binomial pricing model when the warrants are subject to the make-whole table, or otherwise are valued using a Black-Scholes pricing model. Our forward purchase warrants are valued utilizing observable market prices for public shares and warrants, relative to the present value of contractual cash proceeds. The assumptions used in preparing these models include estimates such as volatility, contractual terms, discount rates, dividend rate, expiration dates and risk-free rates.
The estimates used to calculate the fair value of our warrant liability changes at each balance sheet date are based on our stock price and other assumptions described above. If our assumptions change or we experience significant volatility in our stock price or interest rates, the fair value calculated from one balance sheet period to the next could be materially different.
Contingent Consideration
The contingent consideration liability is due to the issuance of the two tranches of restricted Series B-1 and B-2 common stock and Series 1 RCUs and Series 2 RCUs of E2open Holdings as part of the Business Combination. These shares and units were issued on a proportional basis to each holder of Class A shares in CCNB1 and Common Units of E2open Holdings. We also have deferred consideration (earn-out) payments that are due upon the successful attainment of revenue related criteria related to the acquisition of Averetek.
These restricted shares, Common Units and deferred consideration payments are treated as a contingent consideration liability under ASC 805 and valued at fair market value on the acquisition date and will be remeasured at each reporting date and adjusted if necessary. Our earn-out liabilities and contingent consideration are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The assumptions used in preparing these models include estimates such as volatility, contractual terms, discount rates, dividend rates, dividend yield
and risk-free interest rates. Any change in the fair value from the remeasurement will be recorded in acquisition-related expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a gain (loss) on change in fair value of contingent consideration.
The estimates used to calculate the fair value of our contingent consideration changes at each balance sheet date are based on our stock price, operating results and other assumptions. If our assumptions change or we experience significant volatility in our stock price or interest rates, the fair value calculated from one balance sheet period to the next could be materially different.
Provision for Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and are measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that, in the opinion of management, is more likely than not to be realized.
We account for uncertain tax positions by reporting a liability for unrecognizable tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
Business Combinations
We evaluate acquisitions of assets and other similar transactions to assess whether or not the transaction should be accounted for as a business combination or asset acquisition by first applying a test to determine if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If the test is met, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If the test is not met, further determination is required as to whether or not we have acquired inputs and processes that have the ability to create outputs which would meet the definition of a business. Significant judgment is required in the application of the test to determine whether an acquisition is a business combination or an acquisition of assets.
We use the acquisition method in accounting for acquired businesses. Under the acquisition method, our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Determining estimated fair value requires a significant amount of judgment and estimates. If our assumptions change or errors are determined in our calculations, the fair value could materially change resulting in a change in our goodwill or identifiable net assets acquired.
