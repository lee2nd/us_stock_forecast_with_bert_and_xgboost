Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
Statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not historical or current facts are “forward-looking statements” made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “approximate” or “continue,” or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management’s best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
Effects of COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions have affected our businesses, as well as those of our customers and their third-party suppliers and sellers. To serve our customers while also providing for the safety of our employees and service providers, we have adapted numerous aspects of our logistics and transportation processes. We continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and expect to continue to adapt our operations to address federal, state, and local standards as well as to implement standards or processes that we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, and communities.
As reflected in the discussion below, the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response to it had minimal effects on our results of operations. We are experiencing higher net sales, which reflect increased demand, particularly as more people are staying at home, for household staples and other essential products, partially offset by decreased demand for discretionary consumer products, delayed procurement and shipment of non-priority products, and supply chain interruptions. Other effects include increased fulfillment costs and cost of sales, primarily due to investments in employee hiring, pay, and benefits, as well as costs to maintain safe workplaces, and higher shipping costs. We expect to continue to be affected by possible procurement and shipping delays, supply chain interruptions, higher product demand in certain categories, lower product demand in other categories, and increased fulfillment costs and cost of sales as a percentage of net sales through at least Q4 2020, although it is not possible to determine the duration and spread of the pandemic or such actions, the ultimate impact on our results of operations during 2020, or whether other currently unanticipated consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our results of operations.
Termination of agreement with Amazon
On June 19, 2020, Amazon Logistics, Inc. (“Amazon”) notified Prime EFS in writing (the “Prime EFS Termination Notice”), that Amazon did not intend to renew its Delivery Service Partner (DSP) Agreement with Prime EFS when that agreement (the “In-Force Agreement”) expired. In the Prime EFS Termination Notice, Amazon stated that the In-Force Agreement expired on September 30, 2020.
Additionally, on July 17, 2020, Amazon notified Shypdirect that Amazon had elected to terminate the Amazon Relay Carrier Terms of Service (the “Program Agreement”) between Amazon and Shypdirect effective as of November 14, 2020 (the “Shypdirect Termination Notice”). However, on August 3, 2020, Amazon offered to withdraw the Shypdirect Termination Notice and extend the term of the Program Agreement to and including May 14, 2021, conditioned on Prime EFS executing, for nominal consideration, a separation agreement with Amazon under which Prime EFS would agree to cooperate in an orderly transition of its Amazon last-mile delivery business to other service providers, release any and all claims it may have had against Amazon, and covenant not to sue Amazon (the “Aug. 3 Proposal”). On August 4, 2020, the Company, Prime EFS and Shypdirect accepted the Aug. 3 Proposal.
Approximately 54.0% and 42.7% (for a total of 96.7%) of the Company’s revenue of $25,826,632 for the year ended December 31, 2020 were attributable to Prime EFS’s last-mile DSP business and Shypdirect’s mid-mile and long-haul business with Amazon, respectively. The termination of the Amazon last-mile business had a material adverse impact on the Company’s business in the 4th fiscal quarter of 2020 and will have a material adverse impact thereafter. If the Amazon mid-mile and long-haul business is discontinued after May 14, 2021 it would have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business in 2nd fiscal quarter of 2021 and thereafter.
The Company will continue to: (i) seek to replace its last-mile DSP Amazon business and supplement its mid-mile and long-haul Amazon business with other, non-Amazon, customers; (ii) explore other strategic relationships; and (iii) identify potential acquisition opportunities, while continuing to execute our restructuring plan, commenced in February 2020.
On January 15, 2021, the Company, through its newly formed, wholly-owned, subsidiary, Shyp FX, simultaneously executed an asset purchase agreement (“APA”) and closed a transaction to acquire substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Double D Trucking, Inc., a northern New Jersey-based logistics provider specializing in servicing Federal Express (“FedEx”) over the past 25 years (“DDTI”). The purchase price is $100,000 of cash and a promissory note of $400,000. The principal assets involved in the acquisition are vehicles for cargo transport, system equipment for vehicle tracking and navigation of vehicles, and delivery route rights together with assumption of associated customer relationships.
On November 6, 2020, our wholly owned subsidiary, TLSS Acquisition (the “Acquisition Sub”), entered into an asset purchase agreement dated as of November 6, 2020 (“APA”), to acquire substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Cougar Express, Inc., a New York-based full service logistics provider specializing in pickup, warehousing and delivery services in the tri-state area (“Cougar Express”).
Cougar Express is a family-owned full-service transportation business that has been in operation for more than 30 years providing one-to-four person deliveries and offering white glove services. It utilizes its own fleet of trucks, warehouse/driver/office personnel and on-call subcontractors from its convenient and secure New York JFK airport area location, allowing it to pick-up and deliver throughout the New York tri-state area. Cougar Express serves a diverse base of 50 commercial accounts, which are freight forwarders that work with some of the most notable retail businesses in the country. Some of Cougar Express’s accounts have been customers of Cougar Express for more than 20 years.
The APA provides for a purchase price equal to $2,350,000 plus 50% of the difference between the accounts receivable acquired by the Acquisition Sub and the accounts payable assumed by the Acquisition Sub. The Acquisition Sub will also assume indebtedness on certain truck leases and other equipment and service plans for equipment and services that are used by Cougar Express and which will continue to be used by the Acquisition Sub post-closing. After closing, the Acquisition Sub plans to change its name to Cougar Express, Inc., and the seller (the current Cougar Express, Inc. corporation) and its owner would be barred from competing with the Cougar Express business for five years.
The transaction was scheduled to close no later than January 15, 2021, subject to the completion of satisfactory due diligence by us to confirm the accuracy of all of Cougar Express’s representations and warranties in the APA and that Cougar Express has not suffered a material adverse change in its business, and also subject to Cougar Express’s procuring an acceptable landlord’s consent to Cougar Express’s assignment of the lease for its operating facility to the Acquisition Sub, and also subject to our securing financing for the acquisition.
On January 15, 2021, the Company and Cougar Express entered into Amendment No. 1 to the APA (“Amendment No. 1”) which extended the scheduled closing date to February 16, 2021. In connection with the signing of Amendment No. 1, the Company paid a refundable deposit of $25,000. On February 17, 2021, the Company and Cougar Express entered into Amendment No. 2 to the APA (“Amendment No. 2”) which extended the scheduled closing date to March 1, 2021. In connection with the signing of Amendment No. 2, the Company paid an additional refundable deposit of $25,000. As of March 14, 2021, the Company is negotiating a further extension of the scheduled closing date as well as other terms of the APA.
Overview
Transportation and Logistics Systems, Inc. (“TLSS” or the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, on July 25, 2008. The Company operates through its subsidiaries as a logistics and transportation company specializing in ecommerce fulfillment, last mile deliveries, two-person home delivery, mid-mile, and long-haul services for predominantly online retailers.
On March 30, 2017 (the “Closing Date”), TLSS and Save On Transport Inc. (“Save On”) entered into a Share Exchange Agreement, dated as of the same date (the “Share Exchange Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, on the Closing Date, Save On became a wholly-owned subsidiary of TLSS (the “Reverse Merger”). Save On was incorporated in the state of Florida and started business on July 12, 2016. This transaction was treated as a reverse merger and recapitalization of Save On for financial reporting purposes because the Save On shareholders retained an approximate 80% controlling interest in the post-merger consolidated entity. Save On was considered the acquirer for accounting purposes, and the Company’s historical financial statements before the Reverse Merger were replaced with the historical financial statements of Save On before the Reverse Merger. The balance sheets at their historical cost basis of both entities were combined at the Closing Date and the results of operations from the Closing Date forward include the historical results of Save On and results of TLSS from the Closing Date forward. On May 1, 2019, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with Save On and Steven Yariv, whereby the Company returned all of the stock of Save On to Steven Yariv in exchange for Mr. Yariv conveying 1,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company back to the Company. In addition, the Company granted an aggregate of 80,000 options to certain employees of Save On. On April 16, 2019, Mr. Yariv ceased to be an officer or director of the Company.
On June 18, 2018 (the “Acquisition Date”), the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Prime EFS, LLC, a New Jersey limited liability company (“Prime EFS”), from its members pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Stock Purchase Agreement entered into among the Company and the Prime EFS members on the Acquisition Date (the “SPA”). Prime EFS is a New Jersey based transportation company with a focus on deliveries for on-line retailers in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.
On July 24, 2018, we formed Shypdirect LLC (“Shypdirect”), a company organized under the laws of New Jersey. Shypdirect is a transportation company with a focus on tractor trailer and box truck deliveries of product on the east coast of the United States from one distributor’s warehouse to another warehouse or from a distributor’s warehouse to the post office.
The following discussion highlights the results of our operations and the principal factors that have affected the Company’s consolidated financial condition as well as its liquidity and capital resources for the periods described and provides information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations presented herein. The following discussion and analysis are based on the consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. You should read the discussion and analysis together with such consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto.
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 include a summary of our significant accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the discussion below.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Accounting Estimates
The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Significant estimates included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes include the valuation of accounts receivable, the useful life of property and equipment, the valuation of intangible assets, the valuation of right of use assets and related liabilities, assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-lived assets, estimates of current and deferred income taxes and deferred tax valuation allowances, the fair value of non-cash equity transactions, the valuation of derivative liabilities, and the value of claims against the Company.
We have identified the accounting policies below as critical to our business operation:
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses. The Company reviews the accounts receivable on a periodic basis and makes general and specific allowances when there is doubt as to the collectability of individual balances. In evaluating the collectability of individual receivable balances, the Company considers many factors, including the age of the balance, a customer’s historical payment history, its current credit worthiness, and current economic trends. Accounts are written off after exhaustive efforts at collection.
Impairment of long-lived assets
In accordance with ASC Topic 360, we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, or at least annually. We recognize an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset’s estimated fair value and its book value.
Derivative financial instruments
We have certain financial instruments that are embedded derivatives associated with capital raises. We evaluate all our financial instruments to determine if those contracts or any potential embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with ASC 810-10-05-4 and 815-40. This accounting treatment requires that the carrying amount of any embedded derivatives be recorded at fair value at issuance and marked-to-market at each balance sheet date. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, as is the case with the Company, the change in the fair value during the period is recorded as either other income or expense. Upon conversion, exercise or repayment, the respective derivative liability is marked to fair value at the conversion, repayment or exercise date and then the related fair value amount is reclassified to other income or expense as part of gain or loss on extinguishment.
In July 2017, FASB issued ASU No. 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features. These amendments simplify the accounting for certain financial instruments with down-round features. The amendments require companies to disregard the down-round feature when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to its own stock, for purposes of determining liability or equity classification. The guidance was adopted as of January 1, 2019 and we elected to record the effect of this adoption retrospectively to outstanding financial instruments with a down round feature by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet as of the beginning of 2019, the period which the amendment is effective. In accordance with the guidance presented in ASU 2017-11, the fair value of derivative liabilities associated with certain convertible notes as of December 31, 2018 of $838,471 and the offsetting effect of reclassifying such debt to stock-settled debt for which we recorded a put premium liability of $385,385 was reclassified by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2019 in the amount of $453,086.
Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The updated guidance requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for most operating leases. In addition, the updated guidance requires that lessors separate lease and non-lease components in a contract in accordance with the new revenue guidance in ASC 606. The updated guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.
On January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU No. 2016-02, applying the package of practical expedients to leases that commenced before the effective date whereby the Company elected to not reassess the following: (i) whether any expired or existing contracts contain leases and; (ii) initial direct costs for any existing leases. For contracts entered into on or after the effective date, at the inception of a contract the Company assessed whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The Company’s assessment is based on: (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether we obtain the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (3) whether it has the right to direct the use of the asset. We will allocate the consideration in the contract to each lease component based on its relative stand-alone price to determine the lease payments. We have elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a term of 12 months or less.
Operating lease ROU assets represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the adoption date in determining the present value of future payments. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
Revenue recognition and cost of revenue
The Company adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. This ASC is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASC also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer service orders, including significant judgments.
For the Company’s Prime EFS and Shypdirect business activities, we recognize revenues and the related direct costs of such revenue which generally include compensation and related benefits, gas costs, insurance, parking and tolls, truck rental fees, and maintenance fees as of the date the freight is delivered which is when the performance obligation is satisfied. In accordance with ASC Topic 606, we recognize revenue on a gross basis. Our payment terms are net seven days from acceptance of delivery. We do not incur incremental costs obtaining service orders from our Prime EFS and Shypdirect customers, however, if we did, because all of Prime EFS and Shypdirect’s customer contracts are less than a year in duration, any contract costs incurred would be expensed rather than capitalized. The revenue that we recognize arises from deliveries of packages on behalf of the Company’s customers. Primarily, our performance obligations under these service orders correspond to each delivery of packages that we make under the service agreements. Control of the delivery transfers to the recipient upon delivery. Once this occurs, we have satisfied our performance obligation and we recognize revenue.
Management has reviewed the revenue disaggregation disclosure requirements pursuant to ASC 606 and determined that no further disaggregation disclosure is required to be presented.
Stock-based compensation
Stock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718 - “Compensation -Stock Compensation”, which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee, director, or non-employee is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. We have elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur as permitted under ASU 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue our operation.
We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.
For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with the year ended December 31, 2019
The following table sets forth our revenues, expenses and net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The financial information below is derived from our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
Results of Operations
Revenues
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our revenues from continuing operations were $25,826,632 as compared to $31,356,251 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $5,529,619, or 17.6%. This decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in revenue attributable to Prime EFS’s last-mile DSP business of $7,306,507 offset by an increase in revenue from Shypdirect’s mid-mile and long-haul business with Amazon of $1,335,230 and an increase in revenue from other customers of $441,658.
As discussed above, approximately 54.0% and 42.7% of our revenue of $25,826,632 for the year ended December 31, 2020 were attributable to Prime EFS’s last-mile DSP business and Shypdirect’s mid-mile and long-haul business with Amazon, respectively. The termination of the Amazon last-mile business had a material adverse impact on our business in the 4th fiscal quarter of 2020 and will have a material adverse impact thereafter. If the Amazon mid-mile and long-haul business is discontinued after May 14, 2021, it would have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business in 2nd fiscal quarter of 2021 and thereafter. The Company will continue to: (i) seek to replace its last-mile DSP Amazon business and supplement its mid-mile and long-haul Amazon business with other, non-Amazon, customers; (ii) explore other strategic relationships; and (iii) identify potential acquisition opportunities, while continuing to execute our restructuring plan, commenced in February 2020. In connection thereto, in January 2021, we completed the asset acquisition of DDTI and have a pending acquisition to acquire Cougar Express, as discussed elsewhere.
Cost of Revenues
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our cost of revenues from continuing operations was $23,284,240 compared to $28,752,889 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $5,468,649, or 19.0%. Cost of revenues relating to our Prime EFS and Shypdirect segments consists of truck and van rental fees, insurance, gas, maintenance, parking and tolls, and compensation and related benefits.
Gross Profit
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our gross profit was $2,542,392, or 9.8% of revenues, as compared to $2,603,362, or 8.3% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $60,970, or 2.3%. The decrease in gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from a decrease in revenues and a decrease in operational efficiencies in Prime EFS due to the termination of the Amazon last-mile business. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we received a reduction in workers’ compensation balances due of approximately $155,000 resulting from positive results from a prior period workers’ compensation premium audit.
Operating Expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2020, total operating expenses amounted to $10,757,943 as compared to $22,893,963 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $12,136,020, or 53.0%. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, operating expenses consisted of the following:
Compensation and related benefits
For the year ended December 31, 2020, compensation and related benefits amounted to $2,335,388 as compared to $13,158,040 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $10,822,652, or 82.3%. Compensation and related benefits for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 included stock-based compensation of $0 and $8,200,809, respectively, a decrease of $8,200,809, from the granting of shares of our common stock to employees, our former chief executive officer, and our current chief executive officer for services rendered. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the overall decrease in compensation and related benefits was attributable to a decrease in compensation paid to significant employees and the reduction of staff.
Legal and professional fees
For the year ended December 31, 2020, legal and professional fees were $3,920,606 as compared to $2,096,359 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $1,824,247, or 87.0%. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred stock-based consulting fees of $1,999,749 and $325,395, respectively, from the issuance of our common shares and warrants to consultants for business development services rendered, an increase of $1,674,354. Additionally, we had an increase in legal fees related to an increase in ongoing legal matters.
Rent expense
For the year ended December 31, 2020, rent expense was $651,806 as compared to $419,249 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $232,557, or 55.5%. These increases were attributable to a significant expansion in office, warehouse, and parking spaces pursuant to short and long-term operating leases related to the Prime EFS and Shypdirect businesses.
General and administrative expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2020, general and administrative expenses were $814,306 as compared to $2,791,272 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $1,976,966, or 70.8%. This decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in general administrative expenses of $1,109,182 and a decrease in depreciation and amortization of $867,784. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was related to a decrease in amortization of intangible assets of $826,075 due to impairment of the intangible in 2019, and a decrease in depreciation expense of $41,709. In 2020, we cut our overall general and administrative expenses due to cost-cutting measures taken.
Contingency loss
For the year ended December 31, 2020, contingency loss amounted to $3,035,837 as compared to $586,784 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $2,449,053. For the year ended December 31, 2020, contingency loss consisted or the write off of securities deposits of $164,565 and the recorded of a contingent liability of $2,871,272 which are related to the default on truck leases for non-payment of monthly lease payments and the lessors demand for payment of lease termination fees. For the year ended December 31, 2019, contingency loss amounted to $586,784. On or about January 10, 2020, we were named as sole defendant in a civil action captioned Elrac LLC v. Prime EFS, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, assigned Case No. 1 :20-cv-00211 (the “Elrac Action”). The complaint in the Elrac Action alleged that Prime EFS failed to pay in full for repairs allegedly required by reason of property damage to delivery vehicles leased by Prime EFS from Elrac to conduct its business. In connection with this dispute, in 2019, we wrote off all remaining deposits held by Elrac and accrued any additional potential amount due to Elrac in the aggregate amount of $586,784.
Impairment expense
During the year ended December 31, 2019, management tested the intangible asset for impairment. Based on our analysis, we recorded intangible asset impairment expense of $3,842,259 in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. Such analysis considered future cash flows and other industry factors. No impairment expense was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Loss from operations
For the year ended December 31, 2020, loss from operations amounted to $8,215,551 as compared to $20,290,601 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $12,075,050, or 59.5%.
Other expenses (income)
Total other expenses (income) include interest expense, derivative expense, loan fees, gain on debt extinguishment, and other income. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, other expenses (income) consisted of the following:
For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, aggregate interest expense was $7,552,111 and $6,540,450, respectively, an increase of $1.011,661, or 4.5%. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred a 30% default interest penalty of $1,531,335, which was included in interest expense. We did not incur this expense during the 2019 period. This increase in interest expense was offset by a decrease in interest expense attributable to a decrease in interest-bearing loans due to the conversion of debt to equity and a decrease in the amortization of original issue discount.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, loan fees were $601,121. In connection with previous promissory notes payable, on June 11, 2019, we issued 55,000 warrants to purchase 55,000 shares of common stock an exercise price of $1.00 per share. On June 11, 2019, we calculated the fair value of these warrants of $601,121, which was expensed and included in loan fees on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. We did not incur such expense during the 2020 period.
For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the net gain on extinguishment of debt was $7,847,073 and $39,090,168, respectively, a decrease of $31,243,095. The gains on debt extinguishment were attributable to the settlement of convertible debt and warrants, the settlement of secured merchant loans, the conversion of convertible debt, and the settlement of other payables.
On December 17, 2020, we issued 18,685,477 common shares to certain August 2019 equity and debt purchasers as settlement related to the difference between $2.50, the purchase price, and $0.40. These shares were valued at $545,616, or $0.029 per share, based on the quoted trading price on the date of grant. In connection with these shares, we recorded settlement expense of $545,616.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded other income of $376,750 which primarily related to the collection of rental income from the sublease of excess office, warehouse, and parking spaces.
For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, derivative expense was $34,692,503 and $55,841,032, respectively, a decrease of $21,148,529. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded a derivative expense related to the calculated initial derivative fair value of conversion options and warrants. Additionally, we adjusted our derivative liabilities to fair value and recorded derivative expense or income.
Loss from Continuing Operations
For the year ended December 31, 2020, loss from continuing operations amounted to $42,781,958 as compared to $44,183,036 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $1,401,078, or 3.2%.
Discontinued Operations
On May 1, 2019, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Save On and Steven Yariv, whereby the Company returned all of the stock of Save On to Steven Yariv in exchange for Mr. Yariv conveying 1,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company back to the Company. In addition, the Company granted an aggregate of 80,000 options to certain employees of Save On. Accordingly, we reflected Save On as a discontinued operations beginning in the second quarter of 2019, the period that Save On was disposed of, and retroactively for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The businesses of Save On are considered discontinued operations because: (a) the operations and cash flows of Save On were eliminated from the Company’s operations; and (b) the Company has no interest in the divested operations. For the year ended December 31, 2019, loss from discontinued operations amounted to $681,426. We did not have discontinued operations during the 2020 period.
Net Loss
Due to factors discussed above, for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, net loss amounted to $42,781,958 and $44,864,462, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, net loss attributable to common shareholders, which included a deemed dividend related to price protection and beneficial conversion features on preferred stock of $19,223,242 and $981,548, amounted to $62,005,200, or $(0.08) per basic and diluted common share, and $45,846,010, or $(4.80) per basic and diluted common share, respectively.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. On December 31, 2020, we had a cash balance of $579,283. Our working capital deficit was $16,611,286 on December 31, 2020. We reported a net increase in cash for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 of $529,257 primarily as a result of net cash proceeds received from payroll protection loans and convertible debt, offset by the use of cash in operations.
We do not believe that our existing working capital and our future cash flows from operating activities will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our operating needs and debt requirements for the next twelve months. Our cash flows decreased significantly in the fourth quarter of 2020 due to the termination of the Amazon last-mile business. Additionally, as discussed elsewhere, on May 14, 2021, upon termination of the Amazon Relay Carrier Terms of Service between Amazon and Shypdirect, there will be a significant decrease in cash flows from operations. We are seeking to (i) replace its last-mile DSP business and supplement its mid-mile and long-haul business with other, non-Amazon, customers; (ii) explore other strategic relationships; and (iii) identify potential acquisition opportunities, while continuing to execute our restructuring plan, commenced in February 2020. In connection thereto, in January 2021, we completed the asset acquisition of DDTI and have a pending acquisition to acquire Cougar Express, as discussed elsewhere.
Additionally, we are seeking to raise capital through additional debt and/or equity financings to fund our operations in the future. Although we have historically raised capital from sales of shares of common stock and from the issuance of convertible promissory notes and notes payable, there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so. If we are unable to raise additional capital or secure additional lending in the near future, management expects that we will need to curtail our operations.
Recent Financing Activities
Red Diamond Partners LLC and RDW Capital, LLC
On April 9, 2019, the Company entered into agreements (the “RedDiamond Amendments”) with RedDiamond Partners LLC and RDW Capital, LLC, the holders of prior convertible notes representing an aggregate principal amount of $510,000, and agreed with such holders to:
● extend the maturity date of the notes to December 31, 2020;
● remove all convertibility features of the notes; and
● repay not less than half of the obligations then outstanding pursuant to the notes if the Company completes an offering of equity or equity linked securities (including warrants, convertible preferred stock, convertible debentures, or convertible promissory notes) which results in gross proceeds to the Company of at least $4,000,000, using a portion of the proceeds thereof.
Pursuant to the RedDiamond Amendments, the conversion provisions contained in the convertible promissory notes held by RedDiamond and RDW Capital, LLC were suspended and ceased to be exercisable beginning as of April 9, 2019. However, under the RedDiamond Amendments, the conversion provisions contained in the convertible promissory notes held by Red Diamond and RDW Capital, LLC were subject to reinstatement upon the occurrence of an event of default. The parties agreed that it would be considered an event of default under the convertible promissory notes if the Company consummated any new offering of equity or equity linked securities containing a conversion or exercise price which is variable based upon the market trading price of the Company’s securities. On August 30, 2019, the Company entered into a new offering of equity or equity linked securities containing a conversion or exercise price which is variable based upon the market trading price of the Company’s securities. Accordingly, the conversion terms were reinstated and the Company recorded a put premium of $385,385 and recorded interest expense of $385,385.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued 96,661,102 shares of our common stock upon the conversion of debt of $510,000 and accrued interest of $158,141, and as of December 31, 2020, the note payable balances amounted to $0.
Bellridge Capital, LLC
On June 18, 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Bellridge Purchase Agreement”), whereby it issued to Bellridge Capital, LLC (“Bellridge”) a senior secured convertible note in the aggregate principal amount of $2,497,503 (the “Bellridge Note”), for an aggregate purchase price of $1,665,000, net of an original issue discount of $832,503. In addition, the Company paid issue costs of $177,212. The original issue discount and issue costs were recorded as a debt discount to be amortized over the term of the Bellridge Note. The principal due under the Bellridge Note initially accrued interest at a rate of 10% per annum. Principal and interest payments of $232,940 were payable monthly beginning on December 18, 2018 and were due monthly over the term of the Bellridge Note in cash or common stock of the Company, at Bellridge’s discretion.
In connection with the Bellridge Purchase Agreement, Bellridge was issued a warrant, with a term of two years, to purchase up to 4.75% of the fully-diluted outstanding common stock of the Company, for an aggregate purchase price of $100 (the “First Bellridge Warrant”). Additionally, the placement agent for the Bellridge Note was issued a warrant, with a term of two years, to purchase up to 4.75% of the fully-diluted outstanding common stock of the Company, for an aggregate purchase price of $100 (the “Bellridge Note PA Warrant”).
In August 2018, the Company defaulted on the Bellridge Note due to (i) default on the payment of monthly interest payments due, (ii) default caused by the late filing of the Company’s reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2018 and (iii) default due to failure to file a registration statement. Upon an event of default, all principal, accrued interest, and liquidated damages and penalties were due upon request of Bellridge at 125% of such amounts.
On December 27, 2018, Bellridge waived any and all defaults in existence on the Bellridge Note and the Company agreed to issue a warrant that is convertible into 2% of the issued and outstanding shares existing at the time the Company files a registration statement or makes an application to up list to a national stock exchange (the “Second Bellridge Warrant” and together with the First Bellridge Warrant and the Bellridge Note PA Warrant, the “Bellridge Warrants”). Pursuant to the Second Bellridge Warrant, at any time on or before the date that the Company files a registration statement on Form S-l or applies for up-listing to a National Exchange (as defined in the Second Bellridge Warrant), and on or prior to the close of business on the early of the first year anniversary of the issuance of December 27, 2018, Bellridge could have chosen to subscribe for and purchase from the Company up to 2% of the outstanding shares of common stock for an aggregate exercise price of $100. Additionally, the principal interest amount due under the Bellridge Note was modified with a monthly payment of principal and interest due beginning on January 18, 2019 of $156,219 with all remaining principal and interest amounts on the Bellridge Note due on December 18, 2019. This modification was not considered a debt extinguishment.
On April 9, 2019, the Company entered into a new agreement with Bellridge that modified the Bellridge Note and cancelled these warrants (see below).
Through April 9, 2019, all principal and accrued interest under the Bellridge Note was convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock, at a conversion price equal to the lower of $1.50 and 65% of the lowest traded price during the fifteen trading days immediately prior to the conversion date. The Bellridge Note included anti-dilution protection, as well as customary events of default, including, but not limited to, non-payment of the principal or accrued interest due on the Bellridge Note and cross default provisions on other Company obligations or contracts. Upon an event of default, all obligations under the Bellridge Note become immediately due and payable and the Company is required to make certain payments to Bellridge.
On April 9, 2019 (the “Bellridge Modification Date”), the Company entered into an agreement with Bellridge (the “Bellridge Modification Agreement”) that modified its existing obligations to Bellridge as follows:
● the overall principal amount of the Bellridge Note was reduced from the original principal amount of $2,497,502 (principal amount was $2,223,918 at April 9, 2019) to $1,800,000, in exchange for the issuance to Bellridge of 800,000 shares of restricted common stock, to be delivered to Bellridge, either in whole or in part, at such time or times as when the beneficial ownership of such shares by Bellridge will not result in Bellridge’s beneficial ownership of more than the Beneficial Ownership Limitation and such shares are to be issued within three business days of the date the Bellridge has represented to the Company that it is below the Beneficial Ownership Limitation. Such issuances will occur in increments of no fewer than the lesser of (i) 50,000 shares and (ii) the balance of the 800,000 shares owed. The “Beneficial Ownership Limitation” is 4.99% of the number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the Bellridge Modification Agreement. In connection with these shares, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $10,248,000 in April 2019. As of August 19, 2019, 100,000 of these shares have been issued and on August 16, 2019, the Company issued 700,000 shares of Series B Preferred shares upon settlement of 700,000 shares of issuable common stock;
● the maturity date of the Bellridge Note was extended to August 31, 2020;
● the interest rate was reduced from 10% to 5% per annum;
● if the Company completes an offering of equity or equity linked securities (including warrants, convertible preferred stock, convertible debentures or convertible promissory note) which results in gross proceeds to the Company of at least $4,000,000, then the Company will use a portion of the proceeds thereof to repay not less than half of the obligations then outstanding pursuant to the Bellridge Note;
● if the Company completes an offering of debt which results in gross proceeds to the Company of at least $3,000,000, then the Company will use a portion of the proceeds thereof to repay any remaining obligations then outstanding pursuant to the Bellridge Note;
● the convertibility of the Bellridge Note was amended such that the Bellridge Note is only convertible at a conversion price to be mutually agreed upon between the Company and the holder. As of the date of this report, the Company and holder have agreed that the conversion price is $0.02 per share. (see below);
● the registration rights previously granted to Bellridge were eliminated; and
● The First Bellridge Warrant and the Second Bellridge Warrant were cancelled and of no further force or effect as of the Bellridge Modification Date. In exchange, the Company issued Bellridge 360,000 shares of restricted common stock.
In addition, on April 9, 2019, the holders of the Bellridge Note PA Warrants that were exercisable into an aggregate of 4.75% of the outstanding common stock of the Company all agreed to exercise such warrants for an aggregate of 240,000 shares of common stock of the Company.
In an agreement dated August 3, 2020, Bellridge and the Company resolved many of the disputes between them. Among other things, Bellridge and the Company agreed upon the balance of all indebtedness owed to Bellridge as of August 3, 2020 ($2,150,000), a new maturity date on the indebtedness (April 30, 2021), and a price of $0.02 for the conversion of all Bellridge indebtedness into shares of Company common stock.
On July 20, 2020, in connection with the parties’ recent settlement, the Company issued 10,281,018 shares to Bellridge to settle certain claims of Bellridge (see legal matters). During the three months ended September 30, 2020, we issued 107,500,001 shares of our common stock upon the conversion of debt of $1,813,402 and accrued interest of $70,671. As of December 31, 2020, the Bellridge Note payable amounted to $0.
Related Party Convertible Note
On March 13, 2019, we entered into a convertible note agreement with Ms. Wendy Cabral, the Company’s chief executive officer significant other, in the amount of $500,000. Commencing on April 11, 2019 and continuing on the eleventh day of each month thereafter, payments of interest-only on the outstanding principal balance of this note of $7,500 was due and payable. Interest was to accrue with respect to the unpaid principal sum identified above until such principal was paid or converted as provided below at a rate equal to 18% per annum compounded annually. This note was convertible by the holder at any time, in principal amounts of $100,000 in accordance with its terms by delivery of written notice to the Company, into that number of shares of common stock equal to the amount obtained by dividing the portion of the aggregate principal amount that is being converted by $1.37. On July 12, 2019, we entered into a Note Conversion Agreement with Ms. Cabral. In connection with this Note Conversion Agreement, we issued 203,000 shares of our common stock at $2.50 per share for the full conversion of convertible note payable of $500,000 and accrued interest payable of $7,500, and we also issued Ms. Cabral warrants to purchase 203,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $1.81 per share for a period of five years. As of December 31, 2020, this convertible note payable amounted to $0.
Westmount Financial
On April 11, 2019, we entered into a convertible note agreement with Westmount Financial Limited Partnership, an entity controlled by Ms. Cabral, in the amount of $2,000,000. Commencing on May 11, 2019 and continuing on the eleventh day of each month thereafter, payment of interest only in the amount of $30,000 on the outstanding principal balance of this note was due and payable. Interest was to accrue with respect to the unpaid principal sum identified above until such principal is paid or converted as provided below at a rate equal to 18% per annum compounded annually. This note was convertible by the holder at any time in principal amounts of $100,000 in accordance with the terms by delivery of written notice to the Company, into that number of shares of common stock equal to the amount obtained by dividing the portion of the aggregate principal amount of this note that is being converted by $11.81. On July 12, 2019, we entered into a Note Conversion Agreement with Westmount Financial Limited Partnership. In connection with this Note Conversion Agreement, we issued 812,000 shares of our common stock at $2.50 per share for the full conversion of convertible note payable of $2,000,000 and accrued interest payable of $30,000. In connection with the conversion of this convertible note, we also issued to Westmount Financial Limited Partnership warrants to purchase 812,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $2.50 per share for a period of five years. As of December 31, 2020, this convertible note payable amounted to $0.
August 30, 2019 Equity Offering
On August 30, 2019, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with the investor parties thereto (collectively, the “Equity Investors”), pursuant to which the Equity Investors agreed to purchase, severally and not jointly, 585,000 units of the Company, each unit comprised of one share of common stock, and a warrant to purchase one (1) share of common stock (the “Equity Offering”) at an exercise price of $2.50 per share of common stock. The warrants include down-round provisions under which the warrant exercise price could be affected by future equity offerings undertaken by the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2020, down-round provisions were triggered. As of December 31, 2020, the exercise price of these warrants was lowered to $0.006 per share.
Including the Equity Offering, from August 2019 to October 2019, we issued 619,000 shares of our common stock and 619,000 five-year warrants to purchase common shares for an exercise price of $2.50 per common share to investors for cash proceeds of $1,547,500, or $2.50 per share, pursuant to unit subscription agreements.
August 30, 2019 convertible debt and related warrants
On August 30, 2019, we issued and sold to investors convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2,469,840 (the “August 2019 Notes”), and warrants to purchase up to 987,940 shares of our common stock (the “August 2019 Warrants”) pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “August 2019 Debt Purchase Agreement”) with accredited investors. We received net proceeds of $295,534, which is net of 10% original issue discounts of $246,984 and origination fees of $61,101 and is net of $1,643,367 for the repayment of notes payable, and net of $222,854 related to the conversion of existing notes payable already outstanding to these lenders into these August 2019 Notes. The August 2019 Notes initially bore interest at 10% per annum and became due and payable on November 30, 2020. During the existence of an Event of Default (as defined in the August 2019 Notes), interest accrues at the lesser of (i) the rate of 18% per annum, or (ii) the maximum amount permitted by law. Commencing on the four-month anniversary of these August 2019 Notes, monthly payments of interest and monthly principal payments, based on a 12-month amortization schedule (each, an “August 2019 Note Amortization Payment”), were due and payable, until November 30, 2020, at which time all outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest and all other amounts due and payable under the August 2019 Notes were immediately due and payable. The August 2019 Note Amortization Payments are made in cash unless the investor requests payment in our common stock in lieu of a cash payment (each, an “August 2019 Note Stock Payment”). If the investor requests an August 2019 Note Stock Payment, the number of shares of common stock issued is based on the amount of the applicable August 2019 Note Amortization Payment divided by 80% of the lowest VWAP (as defined in the August 2019 Notes) during the five Trading Day (as defined in the August 2019 Notes) period prior to the due date of the August 2019 Note Amortization Payment.
The August 2019 Notes may be prepaid, provided that certain Equity Conditions, as defined in the August 2019 Notes, have been met (or any such failure to meet the Equity Conditions has been waived): (i) from August 30, 2019 until and through November 30, 2019 at an amount equal to 105% of the aggregate of the outstanding principal balance of the August 2019 Notes and accrued and unpaid interest, and (ii) after August 30, 2019 at an amount equal to 115% of the aggregate of the outstanding principal balance of the August 2019 Notes and accrued and unpaid interest. In the event that the Company closes a registered public offering of securities for its own account (a “Public Offering”), the holders may elect to: (x) have their principal and accrued interest prepaid directly from the proceeds of the Public Offering at the prices set forth above, (y) exchange their August 2019 Notes at the closing of the Public Offering for the securities being issued in the Public Offering at the Public Offering prices based upon the outstanding principal, accrued interest and other charges, or (z) continue to hold their August 2019 Notes. Except for a Public Offering and August 2019 Amortization Payments, in order to prepay the August 2019 Notes, the Company must provide at least 20 days’ prior written notice to the holders, during which time the holders may convert their August 2019 Notes in whole or in part at the then-applicable conversion price. For avoidance of doubt, the August 2019 Amortization Payments are prepayments and are subject to prepayment penalties equal to 115% of the August 2019 Amortization Payment. In the event the Company consummates a Public Offering while the August 2019 Notes are outstanding, then 25% of the net proceeds of such offering will, within two business days of the closing of such Public Offering, be applied to reduce the outstanding obligations pursuant to the August 2019 Notes.
From the original issue date until the August 2019 Notes are no longer outstanding, the August 2019 Notes are convertible, in whole or in part, at any time, and from time to time, into shares of common stock at the option of the investor. The initial conversion price of the August 2019 Notes was the lower of: (i) $3.50 per share and (ii) the price per share paid by investors in the contemplated equity offering of up to $1,000,000. If an Event of Default (as defined in the August 2019 Notes) has occurred, regardless of whether it has been cured or remains ongoing, the August 2019 Notes were initially convertible at the lower of: (i) $3.50 and (ii) 70% of the second lowest closing price of the common stock as reported on the Trading Market (as defined in the August 2019 Notes) during the 20 consecutive Trading Day (as defined in the August 2019 Notes) period ending and including the Trading Day (as defined in the August 2019 Notes) immediately preceding the delivery or deemed delivery of the applicable notice of conversion (the “August 2019 Note Default Conversion Price”).
In January 2020, we defaulted on our August 30, 2019 convertible debt due to non-payment of the required amortization payment due. Accordingly, the outstanding principal balance on date of default increased by 30% amounting to approximately $724,000, default interest accrues at 18%, and the default conversion terms now apply as described above. All such Conversion Price determinations are to be appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, reclassification or similar transaction that proportionately decreases or increases the common stock. These August 2019 Notes and related August 2019 Warrants include a down-round provision under which the August 2019 Note conversion price and August 2019 Warrant exercise price were reduced, on a full-ratchet basis, to $0.006 due to the default on the August 2019 Notes triggering the default conversion price. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.
During the six months ended June 30, 2020, we repaid principal of $257,139, settled $128,674 of debt, and we issued 293,677,788 shares of our common stock upon the conversion of principal and default interest of $2,118,311, accrued interest of $48,685 and fees of $1,000. Additionally, accrued interest payable of $84,416 was reclassified to principal balance. During the three months ended September 30, 2020, we issued 39,885,602 shares of our common stock upon the conversion of principal and default interest of $284,249, accrued interest of $8,450 and fees of $900.
Additionally, on July 20, 2020 and July 22, 2020, we entered Exchange Agreements (the “Exchange Agreements”) with two Investors to exchange outstanding August 2019 Notes and August 2019 Warrants for a newly created series of preferred stock designated the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series D”) (See below).
On December 31, 2020, convertible notes payable related to August 30, 2019 convertible debt amounted to $22,064, which consists of $22,064 of principal balance and default interest due. On December 31, 2019, convertible notes payable related to August 30, 2019 convertible debt amounted to $658,623, which consists of $2,469,840 of principal balance due and is net of unamortized debt discount of $1,811,217.
Series D Exchange
On July 20, 2020, the Company entered an Exchange Agreement (the “Cavalry Exchange Agreement”) with one of the investors in the August 2019 Notes and August 2019 Warrants, Cavalry Fund I, LP, (“Cavalry”) to exchange outstanding August 2019 Notes and August 2019 Warrants for a newly created series of preferred stock designated the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series D”). Pursuant to the Cavalry Exchange Agreement, Cavalry exchanged August 2019 Notes with an aggregate remaining principal and accrued interest amounts outstanding of $559,846.31 and August 2019 Warrants to purchase 228,713,916 shares of common stock for 301,457 shares of Series D (the “Cavalry Exchange”).
On July 22, 2020, the Company entered an Exchange Agreement (the “Puritan Exchange Agreement”) with another investor, Puritan Partners LLC (“Puritan”) to exchange outstanding August 2019 Notes and August 2019 Warrants for Series D. Pursuant to the Puritan Exchange Agreement, Puritan exchanged August 2019 Notes with an aggregate remaining principal amount outstanding of $265,843.79 and August 2019 Warrants to purchase 194,445,377 shares of common stock for 221,269 shares of Series D (the “Puritan Exchange” and together with the Cavalry Exchange, the “Series D Exchanges”).
In connection with Cavalry Exchange, the Company and Cavalry entered into a leak-out agreement, dated as of July 20, 2020 (the “Cavalry Leak-Out Agreement”), whereby Cavalry agreed that, until the earliest to occur of (a) 120 days from July 20, 2020, (b) the common stock trading at an average reported volume of at least 100,000,001 shares for three consecutive trading days, (c) the price per share of the common stock exceeding $0.10 in a transaction, (d) the time of release (whether by termination of an applicable leak-out agreement or otherwise), in whole or in part, of any leak-out agreement with any other holder of securities, or (e) any breach by the Company of any term of the Cavalry Leak-Out Agreement that is not cured within five trading days following delivery of written notice of such breach by Cavalry to the Company, neither Cavalry, nor any of its Affiliates (as defined in the Cavalry Leak-Out Agreement), collectively, shall sell, on any trading day, more than 10% of the common stock sold on such trading day.
In connection with the Puritan Exchange, the Company and Puritan entered into a Leak-Out Agreement, dated as of July 22, 2020 (the “Puritan Leak-Out Agreement”), whereby Puritan agreed that, until the earliest to occur of (a) 120 days from July 22, 2020, (b) the common stock trading at an average reported volume of at least 100,000,001 shares for three consecutive trading days, (c) the price per share of the common stock exceeding $0.10 in a transaction, (d) the time of release (whether by termination of an applicable leak-out agreement or otherwise), in whole or in part, of any leak-out agreement with any other holder of securities, or (e) any breach by the Company of any term of the Puritan Leak-Out Agreement that is not cured within five trading days following delivery of written notice of such breach by Puritan to the Company, neither Puritan, nor any of its Affiliates (as defined in the Puritan Leak-Out Agreement), collectively, shall sell, on any trading day, more than 10% of the common stock sold on such trading day.
In connection with the Series D Exchanges, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) created the Series D pursuant to the authority vested in the Board by the Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to issue up to 10,000,0000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share. The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation explicitly authorize the Board to issue any or all of such shares of preferred stock in one (1) or more classes or series and to fix the designations, powers, preferences and rights, the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting any class or series, without further vote or action by the stockholders.
On July 20, 2020, the Board filed the Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series D Preferred Stock (the “Series D COD”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada designating 1,250,000 shares of preferred stock as Series D. The Series D does not have the right to vote. The Series D has a stated value of $6.00 per share (the “Stated Value”). Subject only to the liquidation rights of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock that is currently issued and outstanding, upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the business of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the Series D is entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the Stated Value and then receive a pro-rata portion of the remaining assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock on an as-converted to common stock basis. Until July 20, 2021, the holders of Series D have the right to participate, pro rata, in each subsequent financing in an amount up to 25% of the total proceeds of such financing on the same terms, conditions and price otherwise available in such subsequent financing.
Subject to a beneficial ownership limitation and customary adjustments for stock dividends and stock splits, each share of Series D is convertible into 1,000 shares of common stock. A holder of Series D may not convert any shares of Series D into common stock if the holder (together with the holder’s affiliates and any persons acting as a group together with the holder or any of the holder’s affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the conversion, as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the Series D COD. However, upon notice from the holder to the Company, the holder may decrease or increase the beneficial ownership limitation, which may not exceed 9.99% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise, as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the Series D COD, provided that any such increase or decrease in the beneficial ownership limitation will not take effect until 61 days following notice to the Company.
Approval of at least a majority of the outstanding Series D is required to: (a) amend or repeal any provision of, or add any provision to, the Company’s Articles of Incorporation or bylaws, or file any Certificate of Designation (however such document is named) or articles of amendment to create any class or any series of preferred stock, if such action would adversely alter or change in any respect the preferences, rights, privileges or powers, or restrictions provided for the benefit, of the Series D, regardless of whether any such action shall be by means of amendment to the Articles of Incorporation or bylaws or by merger, consolidation or otherwise or filing any Certificate of Designation, it being understood that the creation of a new security having rights, preferences or privileges senior to or on parity with the Series D in a future financing will not constitute an amendment, addition, alteration, filing, waiver or repeal for these purposes; (b) increase or decrease (other than by conversion) the authorized number of Series D; (c) issue any Series D, other than to the Investors; or (d) without limiting any provision hereunder, whether or not prohibited by the terms of the Series D, circumvent a right of the Series D.
During the period from July 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, we issued 522,726,000 shares of our common stock in connection with the conversion of 522,726 shares of Series D. The conversion ratio was 1,000 shares of common stock for each share of Series D based on the Series D COD. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2020, no shares of Series D were outstanding.
October 3, 2019 convertible debt and related warrants
On October 3, 2019, the Company issued and sold to an investor a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $166,667 (the “October 3 Note”), and warrants to purchase up to 66,401 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “October 3 Warrant”). The Company received net proceeds of $150,000, which is net of a 10% original issue discounts of $16,667. The October 3 Note initially bore interest at 10% per annum and becomes due and payable on January 3, 2021. During the existence of an Event of Default, interest accrues at the lesser of (i) the rate of 18% per annum, or (ii) the maximum amount permitted by law. Commencing on the four-month anniversary of the October 3 Note, monthly payments of interest and monthly principal payments, based on a 12-month amortization schedule (each, an “October 3 Note Amortization Payment”), are due and payable, until the Maturity Date, at which time all outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest and all other amounts due and payable under the October 3 Note will be immediately due and payable. The October 3 Note Amortization Payments are made in cash unless the investor requests payment in the Company’s common stock in lieu of a cash payment (each, an “October 3 Note Stock Payment”). If the investor requests an October 3 Note Stock Payment, the number of shares of common stock issued is based on the amount of the applicable October 3 Note Amortization Payment divided by 80% of the lowest VWAP (as defined in the October 3 Note) during the five Trading Day (as defined in the October 3 Note) period prior to the due date of the October 3 Note Amortization Payment.
The October 3 Note may be prepaid, provided that certain Equity Conditions, as defined in the October 3 Note, have been met (or any such failure to meet the Equity Conditions has been waived): (i) from October 3, 2019 until and through January 3, 2020, at an amount equal to 105% of the aggregate of the outstanding principal balance of the October 3 Note and accrued and unpaid interest, and (ii) after January 3, 2020, at an amount equal to 115% of the aggregate of the outstanding principal balance of the October 3 Note and accrued and unpaid interest. In the event that the Company closes a Public Offering, the holder may elect to: (x) have its principal and accrued interest prepaid directly from the proceeds of the Public Offering at the prices set forth above, (y) exchange its October 3 Note at the closing of the Public Offering for the securities being issued in the Public Offering at the Public Offering prices based upon the outstanding principal, accrued interest and other charges, or (z) continue to hold the October 3 Note. Except for a Public Offering and October 3 Note Amortization Payments, in order to prepay the October 3 Note, the Company must provide at least 20 days’ prior written notice to the holder, during which time the holder may convert the October 3 Note in whole or in part at the conversion price. For avoidance of doubt, the October 3 Note Amortization Payments are prepayments and are subject to prepayment penalties equal to 115% of the October 3 Note Amortization Payment. In the event the Company consummates a Public Offering while the October 3 Note is outstanding, then 25% of the net proceeds of such offering will, within two business days of the closing of such Public Offering, be applied to reduce the outstanding obligations pursuant to the October 3 Note.
On the original issue date until the October 3 Note is no longer outstanding, the October 3 Note is convertible, in whole or in part, at any time, and from time to time, into shares of common stock at the option of the investor. The “Conversion Price” in effect on any Conversion Date means, as of any Conversion Date (as defined in the October 3 Note) or other date of determination, the lower of: (i) $2.51 per share and (ii) the price per share paid by investors in the contemplated equity offering of up to $1,000,000. If an Event of Default (as defined in the October 3 Note) has occurred, regardless of whether such Event of Default (as defined in the October 3 Note) has been cured or remains ongoing, the October 3 Note is convertible at the lower of: (i) $2.51 and (ii) 70% of the second lowest closing price of the common stock as reported on the Trading Market (as defined in the October 3 Note) during the 20 consecutive Trading Day (as defined in the October 3 Note) period ending and including the Trading Day (as defined in the October 3 Note) immediately preceding the delivery or deemed delivery of the applicable Notice of Conversion (the “October 3 Note Default Conversion Price”). All such conversion price determinations are to be appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, reclassification or similar transaction that proportionately decreases or increases the common stock.
This October 3 Note and the related October 3 Warrant include down-round provisions under which the October 3 Note conversion price and October 3 Warrant exercise price were reduced on a full-ratchet basis to $0.006 due to the adjusted conversion price of certain other convertible notes issued by the Company. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.
The October 3 Warrant is exercisable at any time on or after the date of the issuance and entitles the investor to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock for a period of five years from the initial date the October 3 Warrant became exercisable. Under the terms of the October 3 Warrant, the investor is entitled to exercise the October 3 Warrant to purchase up to 66,401 shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial exercise price of $3.51, subject to adjustment as detailed in the October 3 Warrant and described above.
In February 2020, due to the default of the February 2020 October 3 Note Amortization Payment, the October 3 Note was deemed in default. Accordingly, the outstanding principal balance on date of default increased by 30% which amounted to approximately $50,000, default interest accrues at 18%, and the default conversion terms apply as described above. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company issued 27,525,109 shares of its common stock upon the conversion of principal and default interest of $216,667, accrued interest of $11,774, fees of $5,000, and additional interest expense of $2,180.

On December 31, 2019, convertible notes payable related to the October 3, 2019 convertible debt amounted to $33,334, which consists of $166,667 of principal balance due and is net of unamortized debt discount of $133,333.
Fall 2019 notes
On October 14, 2019 and November 7, 2019, we entered into convertible note agreements with an accredited investor. Pursuant to the terms of these convertible note agreements, we issued and sold to an investor convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $500,000 (the “Fall 2019 Notes”) and we received cash proceeds of $500,000. The Fall 2019 Notes bear interest at 10% per annum.

Each Fall 2019 Note was convertible, in whole or in part, at any time, and from time to time, into shares of common stock at the option of the investor. The “Conversion Price” in effect on any Conversion Date means, as of any date of determination, the lower of: (i) $2.50 per share and (ii) the twenty day per share closing trading price of the Company’s common stock during the twenty trading days that close with the last previous trading day ended three days prior to the date of exercise. The Fall 2019 Notes do not contain anti-dilutive provisions. In May 2020, due to the default of a May 2020 Amortization Payment, the October 14, 2019 convertible note was deemed in default. Accordingly, default interest accrued at 18% and the October 14, 2019 convertible note became due on the date of default.

Commencing on the thirteenth month anniversary of each 2020 Note, monthly payments of interest and monthly principal payments, based on a 12-month amortization schedule (each, a “2020 Note Amortization Payment”), will be due and payable, until the Maturity Date (as defined in the applicable 2020 Note), at which time all outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest and all other amounts due and payable under such 2020 Note will be immediately due and payable. The 2020 Note Amortization Payments will be made in cash unless the investor requests payment in the Company’s common stock in lieu of a cash payment (each, a “2020 Note Stock Payment”). If a holder of a 2020 Note requests a 2020 Note Stock Payment, the number of shares of common stock issued will be based on the amount of the applicable 2020 Note Amortization Payment divided by 80% of the lowest VWAP (as defined in the applicable 2020 Note) during the five Trading Day (as defined in the applicable 2020 Note) period prior to the due date of such 2020 Note Amortization Payment.
The Q1/Q2 2020 Notes may be prepaid, provided that certain Equity Conditions, as defined in the Q1/Q2 2020 Notes, have been met (or any such failure to meet the Equity Conditions has been waived): (i) from each Q1/Q2 2020 Note’s respective original issuance date until and through the day that falls on the third month anniversary of such original issue date (each a “Q1/Q2 2020 Note 3 Month Anniversary”) at an amount equal to 105% of the aggregate of the outstanding principal balance of the Q1/Q2 2020 Note and accrued and unpaid interest, and (ii) after the applicable Q1/Q2 2020 Note 3 Month Anniversary at an amount equal to 115% of the aggregate of the outstanding principal balance of the Q1/Q2 2020 Note and accrued and unpaid interest.

Except for a Public Offering and Q1/Q2 2020 Note Amortization Payments, in order to prepay a Q1/Q2 2020 Note, the Company must provide at least 30 days’ prior written notice to the holder thereof, during which time the holder may convert its Q1/Q2 2020 Note in whole or in part at the applicable conversion price. The Q1/Q2 2020 Note Amortization Payments are prepayments and are subject to prepayment penalties equal to 115% of the Q1/Q2 2020 Note Amortization Payment.

After the original issue date of a Q1/Q2 2020 Note until such Q1/Q2 2020 Note is no longer outstanding, such Q1/Q2 2020 Note is convertible, in whole or in part, at any time, and from time to time, into shares of common stock at the option of the holder.

The Q1/Q2 2020 Notes contain down-round protection under which the Q1/Q2 2020 Note conversion price was reduced on a full-ratchet basis, to $0.006 due to the adjusted conversion price of certain other convertible notes issued by the Company.
The Q1/Q2 2020 Warrants are exercisable at any time on or after the date of the issuance and entitle the investors to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock for a period of five years from the initial date the 2020 Warrants become exercisable.

Accordingly, the outstanding principal balance on date of default increased by 30% which amounted to approximately $620,400, default interest accrues at 18%, and the default conversion terms apply.

April 20, 2020 convertible debt
On April 20, 2020, we issued to an investor a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $456,500 (the “April 20 Note”). The April 20 Note contained a 10% original issue discount amounting to $41,500 for a purchase price of $415,000. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the April 20 Note because the investor converted previous notes and accrued interest due to him in the amount of $195,000 into the April 20 Note. In connection with the conversion of notes payable to the April 20 Note, we recorded a loss from debt extinguishment of $220,000. The April 20 Note bore interest at 6% per annum and becomes due and payable on April 20, 2022 (the “April 20 Note Maturity Date”). During the existence of an Event of Default (as defined in the April 20 Note), which includes, amongst other events, any default in the payment of principal and interest payment (including any April 20 Note Amortization Payments) under any note or any other indebtedness, interest accrues at the lesser of (i) the rate of 18% per annum, or (ii) the maximum amount permitted by law. Commencing on the thirteenth month anniversary of the April 20 Note, monthly payments of interest and monthly principal payments, based on a 12-month amortization schedule, will be due and payable (each, an “April 20 Note Amortization Payment”), until the April 20 Note Maturity Date, at which time all outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest and all other amounts due and payable under the April 20 Note will be immediately due and payable. The April 20 Note Amortization Payments will be made in cash unless the investor requests payment in the Company’s common stock in lieu of a cash payment (each, an “April 20 Note Stock Payment”). If the investor requests an April 20 Note Stock Payment, the number of shares of common stock issued will be based on the amount of the applicable April 20 Note Amortization Payment divided by 80% of the lowest VWAP (as defined in the April 20 Note) during the five Trading Day (as defined in the April 20 Note) period prior to the due date of the April 20 Note Amortization Payment.
The April 20 Note may be prepaid, provided that certain Equity Conditions, as defined in the April 20 Note, have been met (or any such failure to meet the Equity Conditions has been waived): (i) from April 20, 2020 until and through July 20, 2020 at an amount equal to 105% of the aggregate of the outstanding principal balance of the April 20 Note and accrued and unpaid interest, and (ii) after July 20, 2020 at an amount equal to 115% of the aggregate of the outstanding principal balance of the April 20 Note and accrued and unpaid interest.

For avoidance of doubt, the April 20 Note Amortization Payments will be prepayments and are subject to prepayment penalties equal to 115% of the April 20 Note Amortization Payment. In the event the Company consummates a Public Offering while the April 20 Note is outstanding, then 25% of the net proceeds of such offering will, within two business days of the closing of such Public Offering, be applied to reduce the outstanding obligations pursuant to the April 20 Note.
Until the April 20 Note is no longer outstanding, it is convertible, in whole or in part, at any time, and from time to time, into shares of common stock at the option of the investor. The “Conversion Price” in effect on any Conversion Date (as defined in the April 20 Note) means, as of any Conversion Date or other date of determination, the lower of: (i) $0.40 and (ii) 70% of the second lowest closing price of the common stock as reported on the Trading Market (as defined in the April 20 Note) during the 20 consecutive Trading Day (as defined in the April 20 Note) period ending and including the Trading Day immediately preceding the delivery or deemed delivery of the applicable notice of conversion. All such Conversion Price determinations are to be appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, reclassification or similar transaction that proportionately decreases or increases the common stock.
Due to the default of August 2019 Note Amortization Payments due on our August 2019 Notes and other notes, the April 20 Note was deemed in default. Accordingly, the outstanding principal balance on date of default increased by 30% which amounted to approximately $136,950, default interest accrues at 18%, and the default conversion terms apply.

Conversions of Convertible Notes, Warrants and Convertible Preferred Stock
The Company’s trading price quoted on the OTC Pink market fell from $3.50 per share on January 8, 2020 to $0.03 on December 31, 2020. This drop, together with anti-dilution protection features contained in the August 2019 Notes and August 2019 Warrants that were triggered upon the issuance of convertible debt beginning in January 2020, caused the conversion prices of most of the Company’s outstanding notes and the exercise price of many of the Company’s outstanding warrants, to fall to $0.006. Beginning in February 2020, note holders began converting the outstanding principal of their notes into substantial quantities of shares of the Company’s common stock. During the period from February 25, 2020 to December 31, 2020, we issued 1,013,408,088 shares of our common stock in connection with the conversion of convertible notes payable and default interest of $8,353,965, accrued interest of $553,596, and fees of $9,080. The conversion price was based on contractual terms of the related debt. On July 24, 2020, we issued 1,000,000 shares of our common stock upon the conversion of 1,000,000 shares of Series B preferred shares. Additionally, the Company issued 155,914,308 shares of its common stock upon the cashless exercise of 157,297,448 warrants. Also, we issued 522,726,000 shares of common stock upon the conversion of 522,726 shares of series D preferred stock and issued other shares of common stock during fiscal 2020. Consequently, the total number of shares of common stock outstanding has increased from 11,832,603 on December 31, 2019, to 1,733,847,494 on December 31, 2020.
These anti-dilution protection features only provide for one-way adjustment, therefore, even if the Company cures any events of default, and the trading price increases, the conversion and exercise prices of the affected notes and warrants will remain a fraction of a penny. As a result, the Company has made commitments to shareholders, convertible note holders and warrant holders to issue, or keep available for issuance, large quantities of additional shares of common stock.
To enable the Company to meet these commitments, the Company’s Board of Directors unanimously adopted a resolution seeking stockholder approval to authorize the Board of Directors to amend the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 500,000,000 shares to 4,000,000,000 shares (the “Authorized Share Increase Amendment”). Stockholder approval for the Authorized Share Increase Amendment was obtained on June 26, 2020 from stockholders that held at least 51% of the voting power of the stock of the Company entitled to vote thereon, as of the record date of June 26, 2020. These consents constituted a sufficient number of votes to approve the Authorized Share Increase Amendment under the Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, bylaws and Nevada law. Pursuant to applicable securities laws and Section 78.390 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, the Company prepared and mailed an Information Statement to its stockholders of record on the record date beginning on June 30, 2020. In compliance with Rule 14(c)-2(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Authorized Share Increase Amendment became effective on July 20, 2020 which was at least twenty calendar days after the Information Statement was first sent to stockholders.

Prime EFS and Shypdirect may prepay the principal of the PPP Loans at any time without incurring any prepayment charges. These PPP Loans may be forgiven partially or fully if the respective loan proceeds are used for covered payroll costs, rent and utilities, provided that such amounts are incurred during the twenty-four-week period that commenced on the date the proceeds of each loan were received and at least 60% of any forgiven amount has been used for covered payroll costs. Any forgiveness of these PPP Loans will be subject to approval by the SBA and M&T Bank and will require Prime EFS and Shypdirect to apply for such treatment in the future.

On June 19, 2020, Amazon notified Prime EFS by the Prime EFS Termination Notice that Amazon did not intend to renew the In-Force Agreement when it expired. In the Prime EFS Termination Notice, Amazon stated that the In-Force Agreement would expire on September 30, 2020.
Additionally, on July 17, 2020, Amazon notified Shypdirect that Amazon had elected to terminate the Program Agreement between Amazon and Shypdirect effective as of November 14, 2020 (the “Shypdirect Termination Notice”). However, on August 3, 2020, pursuant to the Aug. 3 Proposal, Amazon offered to withdraw the Shypdirect Termination Notice and extend the term of the Program Agreement to and including May 14, 2021, conditioned on Prime EFS executing, for nominal consideration, a separation agreement with Amazon under which Prime EFS would agree to cooperate in an orderly transition of its Amazon last-mile delivery business to other service providers, release any and all claims it may have against Amazon, and covenant not to sue Amazon. On August 4, 2020, the Company, Prime EFS and Shypdirect accepted the Aug. 3 Proposal.

Going Concern Consideration
Our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had a net loss of $42,781,958 and $44,864,462 and net cash used in operations was $3,278,258 and $5,659,094, respectively. Additionally, we had an accumulated deficit, shareholders’ deficit, and a working capital deficit of $122,621,060, $16,013,416, and $16,611,286, respectively, on December 31, 2020. Furthermore, during 2020, the Company failed to make required payments of principal and interest on certain of its convertible debt instruments and notes payable.
On June 19, 2020, Amazon notified Prime EFS by the Prime EFS Termination Notice that Amazon would not renew its Delivery Service Partner (DSP) Agreement with Prime EFS when the In-Force Agreement expired on September 30, 2020 and such In-Force Agreement, in fact, expired on September 30, 2020. Additionally, on July 17, 2020, pursuant to the Shypdirect Termination Notice, Amazon notified Shypdirect that Amazon had elected to terminate the Program Agreement between Amazon and Shypdirect effective as of November 14, 2020 (See Note 1). However, on August 3, 2020, Amazon offered pursuant to the Aug. 3 Proposal to withdraw the Shypdirect Termination Notice and extend the term of the Program Agreement to and including May 14, 2021, conditioned on Prime EFS executing, for nominal consideration, a separation agreement with Amazon under which Prime EFS would agree to cooperate in an orderly transition of its Amazon last-mile delivery business to other service providers, release any and all claims it may have against Amazon, and covenant not to sue Amazon. In a “Separation Agreement” dated August 23, 2020, by and among Amazon, Prime EFS and the Company, Prime EFS and the Company agreed, for nominal consideration, that the Delivery Service Partner Program Agreement between Amazon and Prime EFS would terminate effective September 30, 2020; that Prime EFS and the Company would cooperate in an orderly transition of the last-mile delivery business from Prime EFS to other service providers; that Prime EFS would return any and all vehicles leased from Element Fleet Corporation by October 7, 2020 in good repair; and that Prime EFS would dismiss the Amazon Arbitration with prejudice. Under the same Separation Agreement, Prime EFS and the Company released any and all claims they had against Amazon and covenanted not to sue Amazon. In a “Settlement and Release Agreement” dated August 21, 2020, by and among Amazon, Shypdirect, Prime EFS and the Company, Amazon withdrew the Shypdirect Termination Notice and extended the term of the Program Agreement to and including May 14, 2021. In the Settlement and Release Agreement, Shypdirect released any and all claims it had against Amazon, arising under the Program Agreement between Amazon and Shypdirect effective as of November 14, 2020, or otherwise. We do not expect Amazon to renew the Program Agreement upon expiration which will have a material effect on the Company’s operation in the seconds quarter of 2021 and beyond. During the first quarter of 2021, Shypdirect defaulted on certain leases for the leasing of trucks with Ryder. In connection with this default, Ryder has demanded that Shypdirect pay for the leased trucks in the amount of approximately $2,871,000.
It is management’s opinion that these factors raise substantial doubt about Shypdirect and/or the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from the issuance date of this report. In April 2020, the Company’s subsidiaries, Prime EFS and Shypdirect, entered into Paycheck Protection Program promissory notes with M&T Bank in the aggregate amount of $3,446,152. Management cannot provide assurance that the Company will ultimately achieve profitable operations, become cash flow positive, or raise additional debt and/or equity capital.
We will continue to: (i) seek to replace the Company’s last-mile DSP Amazon business and supplement its mid-mile and long-haul Amazon business with other, non-Amazon, customers; (ii) explore other strategic relationships; and (iii) identify potential acquisition opportunities, while continuing to execute our restructuring plan, commenced in February 2020. We are seeking to raise capital through additional debt and/or equity financings to fund our operations in the future. Although we have historically raised capital from sales of common shares and from the issuance of convertible promissory notes and notes payable, there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so. If we are unable to replace our Amazon business, to raise additional capital or secure additional lending in the near future, management expects that we will need to curtail our operations. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
Contractual Obligations
We have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
Effects of Inflation
We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business, revenues, or operating results during the periods presented.
Recently Enacted Accounting Standards
