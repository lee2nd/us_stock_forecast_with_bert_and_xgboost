CAUTIONARY NOTE TO UNITED STATES INVESTORS-INFORMATION CONCERNING PREPARATION OF RESOURCE AND RESERVE ESTIMATES
The Company is an “OTC Reporting Issuer” as that term is defined in BC Multilateral Instrument 51-105, Issuers Quoted in the U.S. Over-the-Counter Markets promulgated by the British Columbia Securities Commission.
In Canada, an issuer is required to provide technical information with respect to mineralization, including reserves and resources, if any, on its mineral exploration properties in accordance with Canadian requirements, which differ significantly from the requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) applicable to registration statements and reports filed by United States companies pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. As such, certain disclosures of mineralization under Canadian standards may not be comparable to similar information made public by United States companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC and not subject to Canadian securities legislation.
While these terms are recognized and required by Canadian securities legislation (under National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101”), entitled Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects), the SEC does not recognize these terms. Investors in the United States are cautioned not to assume that any part or all, of the mineral deposits in these categories, will ever be converted to reserves. In addition, inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of a measured mineral resource, indicated mineral resource or inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian securities legislation, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, although they may form, in certain circumstances, the basis of a “preliminary economic assessment” as that term is defined in NI 43-101. U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all, of any reported measured, indicated, or inferred mineral resource estimates referred to in the DynaMéxico NI 43-101 Technical Report and DynaMéxico 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate (compiled for DynaResource de México SA de CV), are economically or legally mineable.
Under U.S. standards, as set forth in SEC Industry Guide 7, mineralization may not be classified as a “reserve” unless a determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. The SJG Property as described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is without known reserves. Mineral resources which are not classified as mineral reserves do not have “demonstrated economic viability.” The quantity of resources and the quality (grade) of resources reported as “Indicated” and “Inferred” mineral resources in the DynaMéxico 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate compiled for DynaResource de México SA de CV, under Canadian National Instrument 43-101 and filed by the Company with SEDAR, are not disclosed in this Form 10-K. There has been insufficient exploration to define any mineral reserves on the SJG Property, and it is not certain if further exploration will result in the definition of mineral reserves.

Project Improvements, Expansion and Increased Output (2017 To 2020)
The Company continues its business plan of operations at San Jose de Gracía, which is to improve, increase and expand test mining and pilot milling operations and generally, to increase production of gold ounces. Since January 2015 startup of the test mining and milling activities, the Company has increased daily output from an initial 75 tons per 24-hour operating day, to a current 200 tons per 24-hour operating day, and during first quarter 2021 the Company expects to achieve production output of 300 tons per 24-hour operating day. (Note the Summary of Test Mining and Pilot Mill Operations for 2018 to 2021 below).
Since January 2017, the Company has expended over $13.1 million USD in non-operating costs, generally classified as project improvements and expansion costs which have been expensed in the company’s financial statements. These funds have been provided primarily from cash flows from operations. An itemized list of these non-operating costs is described below:
The Company is currently reporting all costs of mine operations, improvements, and expansion as expenses in accordance with United States General Accepted Accounting Principal (GAAP) requirements. The result of expensing all costs is that the Company has accumulated a net loss carry forward from México operations of $37 million USD which is available to offset future taxable earnings.
Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Summary of Test Mining and Pilot Mill Operations for 2020, 2019 and 2018:
DynaMineras continued to increase its test underground mining activity and pilot milling operations in 2020; and projects the increased output from to 300 tons per 24-hour operating /day from the mine and mill during 2021.
Test pilot operations in 2020 yielded 44,218 Tons mined and processed from underground test mining activity and pilot milling operations; and the production of approximately 7,001 gross Oz Au, and net of dry weight adjustments at the buyer’s facilities, the production of approximately 5,828 Oz Au. The Company reports net revenue of $9,048,831 net of buyer’s price discount and refining and treatment costs.
Test pilot operations in 2019 yielded 66,031 Tons mined and processed from underground test mining activity and pilot milling operations; and the production of approximately 10,646 gross Oz Au, and net of dry weight adjustments at the buyer’s facilities, the production of approximately 9,713 Oz Au. The Company reports net revenue of $11,612,722 net of buyer’s price discount and refining and treatment costs. In February 2020 the Company transitioned mining activity from San Pablo to Tres Amigos in order to achieve the opening of the Tres Amigos Mine. The Company determined it was best to preserve its remaining cash resources and redirect mining efforts to the opening of the Tres Amigos mine and the upgrade of the Company’s mill with a goal of achieving 300 tons pilot mill production per 24-hour operating day. During this transition period, limited pilot milling operations were achieved. The Company resumed pilot milling operations in July 2020. Therefore, overall revenue and expenses related to mining and milling operations were significantly lower for the first six months of 2020 than the same period in 2019. Likewise, mine expansion expenses are significantly higher.
DynaMineras expects to continue its test underground mining activity and pilot milling operations in 2021; and projects the output of 300 tons per 24-hour operating day from the mine and mill in 2021.
REVENUE. Revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $9,048,831 and $11,612,722, respectively. The Company continued the test mining and pilot mill processing at San Jose de Gracía, including the production and sale of precious metals concentrates. The YTD decrease is a result on the company’s transition of test mining operations from San Pablo to Tres Amigos from March to June 2020. Revenue in the second half of the year increased over 2019 due to the increase in processing capacity from Mill expansion, the higher grade from the opening of the Tres Amigos mine and the increase in gold prices.
PRODUCTION COSTS RELATED TO SALES. Production costs related to sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $1,166,135 and $1,666,521, respectively. These are expenses directly related to the milling, packaging and shipping of gold and other precious metals product. This represents a decrease in the cost per ton of milling ore. The YTD decrease was due to the Company’s ceasing mill operations from March to June to complete the facility upgrade.
MINE PRODUCTION COSTS. Mine production costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $2,370,972 and $3,557,850 respectively. These costs were directly related to the extraction of mine tonnage to be processed at the mill. The YTD decrease was a result of decreased tonnage mined.
MINE EXPLORATION COSTS. Mine exploration costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $1,610,747 and $1,486,037, respectively. These were the costs of extracting waste material to reach the materials to be extracted for processing. The YTD increase was a result of opening the Tres Amigos mine.
MINE EXPANSION COSTS: Mine expansion costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $909,190 and $689,405, respectively. These were the costs associated with the expansion of the mining facilities and the cost associated with preparing the Tres Amigos for production.
TRANSPORTATION. Transportation costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $528,423 and $816,504, respectively. These were the costs of transporting the product to the customer for treatment and sale. The decrease is consistent with the overall decrease in production.
CAMP, WAREHOUSE AND SUPPORT FACILITIES. Camp, warehouse and support facility cost for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $2,036,610 and $2,547,910, respectively. These were the support costs of the mining facilities including housing, food, security and warehouse operations. The decrease was a result of decreased activity at the camp during the shutdown of mining activity.
PROPERTY HOLDING COSTS. Property holding costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $137,377 and $446,806, respectively. These costs were concessions taxes, leases on land and other direct costs of maintaining the property. The 2019 costs included settlement of prior year’s concession for an amount in excess of the accrual. The current year costs consist only of core concessions and the reduced area of the Francisco Arturo concession.
GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. General and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $2,996,073 and $2,053,083 respectively. These were the costs of operating the Company not directly associated with the mine operations including management, accounting, and legal expenses. The year-to-date increase was largely a result of legal fees associated with the Company’s successful recovery of the non-controlling stock and legal cost of the Company’s new financing.
OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE). Other income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $(2,685,878) and $793,803 respectively. Included in this category in 2020 was interest expense of $(1,133,360), change in derivative of $(1,186,964), currency transaction loss of $(361,127), and other expense of $(4,427). Included in this category in 2019 was interest expense of $(492,907), other income of $970, change in derivative liability of $888,579 and currency transaction gain of $397,161. The increase in derivative liability is the result of the extension of stock warrants and the issuance of new convertible debt and stock warrants as part of the Golden Post financing. Likewise, the increase in interest expense is reflective of the Company’s increase in debt.
NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST. The non-controlling interest portion of the net loss for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $61,589 and $62,511, respectively. This represented the non-controlling interest share of Dyna México’s loss. The 2020 allocation included only the non-controlling interest’s share of the net loss for January and February as the non-controlling interest was eliminated at the end of February.
OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS). Comprehensive income (loss) includes the Company’s net income (loss) plus the unrealized currency translation gain (loss) for the period. The Company’s other comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 consisted of unrealized currency gains (losses) of $100,582 and $(970,981), respectively. The YTD decrease is due to the variances in the peso exchange rates throughout the two years.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had working capital of $(5,778,992), comprised of current assets of $6,818,412 and current liabilities of $12,597,404. This represented a decrease of $2,422,622 from the working capital maintained by the Company of $(3,356,370) as of December 31, 2019. The primary reason for the decrease was the increase in derivative liabilities associated with the Company’s new financing.
Net cash provided by (used in) operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $(2,421,108) compared to $(1,321,360) in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily the result of the Company’s increase in operating loss as a result of the Company’s suspension of production mining and pilot milling operations during the first half of the year.
Net cash provided by (used) in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $0 and $0, respectively. In 2020 and 2019 expenditures necessary for the expansion of mining operations totaling $168,806 and $639,199, respectively which would normally have been included in this category were expenses due to the company’s lack of proven and probable reserves.
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $3,594,323 compared to $(111,977) for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase represents the net proceeds from the Company’s Golden Post financing.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, which have or are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
Plan of Operation
The Plan of operation for the next twelve months includes DynaMineras continuing the improvement and expansion of the test mining and pilot milling operations at SJG. The Company commenced its testing activities in fall 2015 at the rate of approximately 100 tons per 24-hour operating day from the mine and approximately the same output from the processing plant. Over the past five years, the Company has gradually increased its output to approximately 200 tons per 24-hour operating day from the mines and processing plant. In 2021, the Company projects to complete its phases of expansion to reach the output of approximately 300 tons per 24-hour operating day from the mine and the processing plant.
The Company funds its general and administrative expenses in the US. The Company’s operating subsidiaries, DynaMineras and DynaOperaciones, receive monthly fees for management of SJG activities and personnel. These amounts are eliminated in consolidation. The Company believes that cash on hand, and including cash flow generated from its current operations, is adequate to fund its ongoing general and administrative expenses through 2021.
Capital Expenditures
The Company’s primary activities relate to the test mining and pilot milling operations of the SJG property through its 100% owned operating subsidiary, DynaMineras. DynaMineras is conducting activities at SJG under the terms of the Exploitation Amendment Agreement (the “EAA”, or “operating agreement”) with DynaMéxico.
No Known Reserves
The SJG property is without known reserves. Under U.S. standards, mineralization may not be classified as a “reserve” unless a determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made.
Exploitation Amendment Agreement (“EAA”)
On May 15, 2013, DynaMineras entered into an Exploitation Amendment Agreement (“EAA”) with DynaMéxico. The EAA grants to DynaMineras the right to finance, explore, develop and exploit the SJG Property, in exchange for: (A) Reimbursement of all costs associated with financing, maintenance, exploration, development and exploitation of the SJG Property, which costs are to be charged and billed by DynaMineras to DynaMéxico; and, (B) After Item (A) above, the receipt by DynaMineras of 75% of gross receipts received by DynaMéxico from the sale of all minerals produced from SJG, to the point that DynaMineras has received 200% of its advanced funds; and, (C) after items (A) and (B) above; the receipt by DynaMineras of 50% of all gross receipts received by DynaMéxico from the sale of all minerals produced from SJG, and throughout the term of the EAA; and, (D) in addition to Items (A), (B), and (C) above, DynaMineras shall receive a 2.5% NSR (“Net Smelter Royalty”) on all minerals sold from SJG over the term of the EAA. The total Advances made by DynaMineras to DynaMéxico as of December 31, 2014 is $4,025,000. The EAA is the third and latest Amendment to the original Contract Mining Services and Mineral Production Agreement (the “Operating Agreement”), which was previously entered into by DynaMineras with DynaMéxico in April 2005, wherein DynaMineras was named the Exclusive Operating Entity at SJG. The Operating Agreement was previously amended in September 2006 (the “First Amendment”) and amended again at July 15, 2011 (the “Second Amendment”). The Term of the Second Amendment is 20 years, and the EAA (Third Amendment) provides for the continuation of the 20 Year Term from the date of the Second Amendment (July 15, 2011).
Exclusive Operating Entity at San Jose de Gracía
Under agreement with DynaMéxico, Mineras de DynaResource S.A. de C.V. (“DynaMineras”) has been named the exclusive operating entity at the San Jose de Gracía Project. DynaResource owns 100% of DynaMineras.
DynaMéxico General Powers of Attorney
The Chairman-CEO of DynaUSA also serves as the President of DynaMéxico and as the President of DynaMineras. The President of DynaMéxico holds broad powers of attorney granted by the shareholders of DynaMéxico which gives the current President significant and broad authority within DynaMéxico.
Note Receivable and Investments in Affiliate
DynaResource Nevada, Inc., a Nevada Corporation (“DynaNevada”), with one operating subsidiary in México, DynaNevada de México, S.A. de C.V. (“DynaNevada de México”) have common officers, directors and shareholders. The total amount loaned by the Company to DynaNevada at December 31, 2010 was $805,760. The terms of the Note Receivable provided for a “Convertible Loan,” repayable at 5% interest over a 3-year period, and convertible at the Company’s option into Common Stock of DynaNevada at $0.25 / Share. On December 31, 2010, the Company converted its receivable from DynaNevada into 3,223,040 Shares of DynaNevada; and as a result, the Company owns 19.92% of the outstanding shares of DynaNevada. DynaNevada is therefore a related entity, and through its subsidiary in México (DynaNevada de México), (“DynaNevada de México”), has entered into an Option agreement with Grupo México (“IMMSA”) in México, for the exploration and development of approximately 3,000 hectares in the State of San Luis Potosi (“the Santa Gertrudis Property”).
