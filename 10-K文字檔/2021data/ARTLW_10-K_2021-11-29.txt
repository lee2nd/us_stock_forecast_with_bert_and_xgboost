ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Results of Operations
The following summary of our results of operations, for the year ended August 31, 2021 and 2020, should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements, as included in this Form 10-K.
Our Company currently has no revenue. We classify our operating expenses into research and development, professional fees, and selling, general and administrative expenses. Research and development expense consists of expenses incurred while performing research and development activities to discover and develop our product candidates. This includes conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings for product candidates. We recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred.
The Company has incurred losses for the past several years and a net loss of $7.4 million during the year ended August 31, 2021. Subsequent to August 31, 2021, we completed an offering for net proceeds of approximately $18.3 million, which substantially increased our cash and cash equivalents and improved our working capital position (Note 9). Consequently, our existing cash resources and cash received from the public offering are expected to provide sufficient funds to carry out our planned operations for at least 12 months from the date that our consolidated financial statements are issued.
The following table provides selected financial data about the Company as of August 31, 2021 and 2020.
Balance Sheet Data
The increase in cash was primarily due to a public offering in October 2020 and proceeds from exercise of warrants during the year ended August 31, 2021.
For the Year ended August 31, 2021 Compared to the Year ended August 31, 2020
Our operating expenses, for the year ended August 31, 2021, were $7.4 million compared to $4.7 million for the same period in 2020. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in research and development, including the initiation and ongoing expenses related to the CAReS trial, and general and administrative expense related to payroll and director compensation including stock-based compensation.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis.
We incurred a net loss of $7.4 million and $4.7 million for the years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of August 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $6.6 million. We anticipate that operating losses and net cash used in operating activities will increase over the next few years as we advance our programs under development.
As of August 31, 2021, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $16.9 million and working capital of $9.8 million. As of August 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $6.6 million. During the year ended August 31, 2021, 1,393,591 shares were sold in connection with the Company’s at-the-market equity program for proceeds net of offering costs of $1.5 million. In October 2020 we raised $6.6 million in net proceeds through a public offering. In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 we raised an additional $18.3 million in net proceeds through the Company’s at-the-market equity program. We anticipate that operating losses and net cash used in operating activities will increase over the next few years as we advance our programs under development. We believe our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months following the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Critical Accounting Policies
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financial statements.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these good faith estimates and judgments.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued and determined that the adoption of these pronouncements would not have a material effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.
