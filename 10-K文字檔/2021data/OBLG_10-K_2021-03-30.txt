Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related notes attached thereto. All statements contained herein that are not historical facts, including, but not limited to, statements regarding anticipated future capital requirements, our future development plans, our ability to obtain debt, equity or other financing, and our ability to generate cash from operations, are based on current expectations. The discussion of results, causes and trends should not be construed to imply any conclusion that such results or trends will necessarily continue in the future. Because the closing of the acquisition of Oblong Industries occurred on October 1, 2019, the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, included in this Report only reflect Oblong Industries’ financial results for the fourth quarter of 2019.
Business
Oblong, Inc. (“Oblong” or “we” or “us” or the “Company”) was formed as a Delaware corporation in May 2000 and prior to March 6, 2020, was named Glowpoint, Inc. (“Glowpoint”). On October 1, 2019, the Company closed an acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of Oblong Industries, Inc., a privately held Delaware corporation founded in 2006 (“Oblong Industries”), pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, among other things, Oblong Industries became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”). See further discussion of the Merger in Note 3 - Oblong Industries Acquisition to our consolidated financial statements attached hereto. On March 6, 2020, Glowpoint changed its name to Oblong, Inc. In this Report, we use the terms “Oblong” or “we” or “us” or the “Company” to refer to (i) Oblong (formerly Glowpoint), for periods prior to the closing of the Merger and (ii) the “combined organization” of Oblong, Inc. (formerly Glowpoint) and Oblong Industries for periods after the closing of the Merger. For purposes of segment reporting, we refer to the Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) business as “Glowpoint” herein, and to the Oblong Industries business as “Oblong Industries” herein.
Since the closing of the Merger on October 1, 2019, we have been focused on the integration of the businesses of Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) and Oblong Industries into a combined organization. While our acquisition of Oblong Industries provides additional revenues to the combined organization, the cost to further develop and commercialize Oblong Industries’ product offerings is expected to exceed its revenues for the foreseeable future. We believe there is a substantial market opportunity for Oblong Industries’ product offerings and services, and we are in the process of transforming our offerings to meet the evolving needs of our customers. As part of the transformation of our business, we are evolving certain aspects of our model by designing and developing software to include subscription-based offerings. Historically, our technology products and services have been developed and consumed in conventional commercial real estate spaces such as conference rooms. As our core collaboration products evolve, we expect to add more contemporary software features along with expanded accessibility beyond commercial spaces through both hybrid and SaaS offerings. These initiatives will require significant investment in technology development and sales and marketing.
We have achieved certain revenue and cost synergies in connection with combining Oblong and Oblong Industries; we reduced the total of general and administrative, research and development and sales and marketing expenses 49% from $5,656,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019 to $2,899,000 in the fourth quarter of 2020. We believe additional capital will be required to fund operations and provide growth capital including investments in Oblong Industries’ technology, product development and sales and marketing. We intend to invest sales and marketing resources to expand awareness of Oblong Industries’ product offerings with the goal of increasing adoption and growing revenue.
Glowpoint’s business has experienced revenue declines in recent years which we expect to continue. We currently expect to continue operating the Glowpoint business as part of our combined organization, however, we plan to seek opportunities in the future to divest some or all of Glowpoint’s business.
Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2020 (“2020”) versus Year Ended December 31, 2019 (“2019”)
Segment Reporting
As discussed above, on October 1, 2019, the Company acquired Oblong Industries, and Oblong Industries became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Prior to the acquisition of Oblong Industries on October 1, 2019, the Company operated in one segment. Effective October 1, 2019, the former businesses of Glowpoint (now Oblong, Inc.) and Oblong Industries were
managed separately during the fourth quarter of 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2020, and involved different products and services. Accordingly, the Company currently operates in two segments: (1) the Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) business which mainly consists of managed services for video collaboration and network and (2) the Oblong Industries business which consists of products and services for visual collaboration technologies.
Because the closing of the acquisition of Oblong Industries occurred on October 1, 2019, the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 included in this Report only reflect Oblong Industries’ financial results for the fourth quarter of 2019. Certain information concerning the Company’s segments for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, is presented in the following table (in thousands):
Unallocated operating expenses include costs, after the October 1, 2019 acquisition date, that are not specific to a particular segment but are general to the group; included are expenses incurred for administrative and accounting staff, general liability and other insurance, professional fees and other similar corporate expenses. Interest and other (income) expense, net, is also not allocated to the operating segments.
As shown in the table below, the combined organization’s total revenue for calendar year 2019 on a pro forma basis (as if the acquisition of Oblong Industries had occurred on January 1, 2019), was $25.6 million.
Revenue. Total revenue increased $2,506,000 (or 20%) in 2020 to $15,333,000 from $12,827,000 in 2019. The following table summarizes the changes in components of our revenue, and the significant changes in revenue are discussed in more detail below.
Oblong (formerly Glowpoint)
•Revenue for managed services for video collaboration services decreased $3,153,000 (or 57%) to $2,413,000 in 2020, from $5,566,000 in 2019. This decrease is mainly attributable to lower revenue from existing customers (either from reductions in price or level of services) and loss of customers to competition.
•Revenue for network services decreased $249,000 (or 6%) to $3,611,000 in 2020 from $3,860,000 in 2019. This decrease is mainly attributable to net attrition of customers and lower demand for our services given the competitive environment and pressure on pricing that exists in the network services business.
•Revenue for professional and other services decreased $31,000 (or 13%) to $203,000 in 2020 from $234,000 in 2019. This decrease is mainly attributable to lower resale of video equipment.
Oblong Industries
•For Oblong Industries, the increase in revenue in each of the different components is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Oblong Industries on October 1, 2019. Oblong Industries revenue for 2020 includes a full year of revenue, compared to revenue for 2019, which only included three months. Oblong Industries revenue for 2020 decreased compared to pro forma 2019, shown above, primarily as a result of delayed fulfillment and order placements and cancellation of professional services, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
•Revenue for visual collaboration product offerings increased $4,693,000 (or 215%) to $6,873,000 in 2020 from $2,180,000 in 2019.
•Revenue for professional services increased $324,000 (or 46%) to $1,033,000 in 2020 from $709,000 in 2019. Oblong Industries’ professional service revenue was generated from a specialized group of personnel that delivered innovative architectural scale spatial computing solutions for customers implementing Executive Briefing Centers, Command Centers, Television studios and Virtual Wargaming environments. A former customer terminated our professional services effective April 30, 2020 due to COVID-19. Our professional services revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily attributable to this customer. We do not expect to generate revenue from professional services in 2021 and in the future.
•Revenue for licensing increased $922,000 (or 332%) to $1,200,000 in 2020 from $278,000 in 2019. A former customer terminated the licensing of our technology effective December, 31 2020. Our licensing revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily attributable to this customer. We do not expect to generate material revenue from licensing in 2021.
Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, includes all internal and external costs related to the delivery of revenue. Cost of revenue also includes the cost for taxes which have been billed to customers.
Cost of revenue decreased to $7,280,000 in 2020 from $7,427,000 in 2019. The $147,000 decrease in cost of revenue from 2019 to 2020 is mainly attributable to lower costs associated with the decrease in Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) revenue during the same period, partially offset by the increased costs related to the increase in revenue for Oblong Industries from 2019 to 2020. The Company’s total gross profit, as a percentage of revenue, improved to 53% in 2020 as compared to 42% in 2019. For Oblong, gross profit, as a percentage of Oblong revenue, improved to 39% for 2020 from 35% for 2019. This improvement was due to reduced personnel costs as a percentage of revenue. For Oblong Industries, gross profit, as a percentage of revenue was 62% for of 2020 as compared to 63% for 2019.
Research and Development. Research and development expenses include internal and external costs related to developing features and enhancements to our existing services. Research and development expenses in 2020 and 2019 were $3,711,000 and $2,023,000, respectively. This increase is primarily attributable to a full year of research and development expenses for Oblong Industries in 2020, as compared to inclusion of only the fourth quarter for 2019.
Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses in 2020 and 2019 were $3,392,000 and $1,936,000, respectively. This increase is primarily attributable to a full year of sales and marketing expenses for Oblong Industries in 2020, as compared to inclusion of only the fourth quarter for 2019.
General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses include direct corporate expenses related to costs of personnel in the various corporate support categories, including executive, legal, finance and accounting, human resources and information technology. General and administrative expenses in 2020 and 2019 were $6,724,000 and $5,377,000, respectively. This increase is mainly attributable to an increase related to a full year of general and administrative expenses for Oblong Industries in 2020 as compared to inclusion of only the fourth quarter for 2019.
Impairment Charges. Impairment charges in 2020 and 2019 were $1,150,000 and $2,317,000, respectively. The impairment charges for 2020 are primarily attributable to $541,000 on Oblong’s goodwill, $465,000 on right-of-use assets related to Oblong Industries operating leases, and $144,000 on assets no longer used in the business. For 2019, the impairment charges are primarily attributable to $2,254,000 on goodwill and $63,000 on capitalized software no longer in service. Future declines of our revenue, cash flows and/or stock price may give rise to a triggering event that may require the Company to record impairment charges in the future related to our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets.
Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses in 2020 and 2019 were $3,140,000 and $1,321,000, respectively. This increase of $1,819,000 is mainly attributable to $2,878,000 of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in 2020 related to assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of Oblong Industries, compared to $754,000 of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019, partially offset by a decrease of $305,000 in depreciation and amortization expense for Oblong as certain assets became fully depreciated in 2020.
Loss from Operations. Loss from operations increased to $10,064,000 in 2020 from $7,574,000 in 2019. The increase in the Company’s loss from operations is mainly attributable to an increase of $5,143,000 in operating expenses, partially offset by an increase of $2,653,000 in gross profit, as discussed further above.
Interest and Other (Income) Expense, Net. Interest and other (income) expense in 2020 was income of $2,746,000, comprised of (i) a gain on extinguishment of debt of $3,117,000 related to the satisfaction of the SVB loan, partially offset by (ii) $352,000 of interest expense on the Company’s debt obligations. Interest and other expense, net in 2019 was $187,000, comprised of (i) $97,000 of interest expense on the Company’s debt obligations with Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) during the fourth quarter of 2019, and (ii) $90,000 of amortization of debt discount costs related to the SVB Loan Agreement.
Income Tax Expense. We did not record any income tax expense in 2020 and 2019 (see Note 17 - Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements).
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $5,277,000 (including restricted cash of $219,000) and $4,602,000 of cash, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred net losses of $7,421,000 and $7,761,000, respectively, and net cash used in operating activities was $6,566,000 and $3,253,000, respectively.
Net cash used in investing activities for 2020 was $31,000 and primarily related to purchases of property and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2019 was $2,149,000, and primarily related to cash acquired in the merger.
Net cash provided by financing activities in 2020 was $7,272,000, primarily attributable to net proceeds of $7,371,000 from two private placements of common stock and $2,417,000 of proceeds from the PPP Loan, partially offset by the satisfaction payment of $2,500,000 on the SVB Loan. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2019 was $3,699,000, primarily attributable to net proceeds of $3,750,000 from a private placement of Series E Preferred Stock, partially offset by $51,000 used to purchase treasury stock.
SVB Loan Agreement
On October 1, 2019, in connection with the Acquisition of Oblong Industries, the Company and Oblong Industries, as borrowers, and Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”), as lender, executed an amendment to the SVB Loan Agreement. On October 24, 2019, GP Communications joined the SVB Loan Agreement as an additional co-borrower. The SVB Loan Agreement provided for a term loan facility of approximately $5,247,000, (the “SVB Loan”), all of which was outstanding at December 31, 2019. On June 26, 2020, the Company and SVB entered into a Default Waiver and First Amendment (the “Amendment”) to the SVB Loan Agreement. Under the Amendment, the Bank agreed to extend the interest-only payment period under the SVB Loan Agreement through September 30, 2020, after which equal monthly principal payments of $291,500 were payable over an eighteen month period from October 1, 2020 through March 1, 2022 (the “Maturity Date”) to fully repay the loan. The SVB Loan originally accrued interest at a rate equal to the Prime Rate (as defined in the SVB Loan Agreement) plus 200 basis points (for a total of 6.75% as of December 31, 2019). In connection with the Amendment, the interest rate under the SVB Loan was increased to the Prime Rate plus 425 basis points (for a total of 7.50% as of September 30, 2020).
In connection with its execution of the amended SVB Loan Agreement on October 1, 2019, the Company (i) agreed to pay SVB a fee of $100,000 on April 1, 2020 (the “Deferral Fee”) and (ii) issued a warrant to SVB that entitles SVB to purchase 72,394 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share (the “SVB Warrant”). Pursuant to the Amendment, the due date for the Deferral Fee was changed to the earlier of (i) the maturity of the loan, (ii) the repayment in full of all principal and interest owing under the Loan Agreement, and (iii) occurrence of an event of default under the Loan Agreement. The SVB Warrant has a ten (10) year term. The fair value of the SVB Warrant was recorded to additional paid-in capital and was determined to be $72,000 using the Black-Scholes model. The total obligations under the SVB Loan Agreement were $5,509,000, comprised of $5,247,000 for the SVB Loan, the Deferral Fee and the Maturity Fee of $262,000 that was assumed on October 1, 2019 as part of the Acquisition. The Deferral Fee, the fair value of the SVB Warrant, and $20 of debt issuance costs totaled $192 and was recorded as a discount to the debt. The remaining unamortized debt discount as of December 31, 2019 was $130,000. This debt discount was being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the debt. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company amortized $81,000 of the debt discount, which is recorded in “Interest and other expense, Net” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and $49 of the discount was forgiven in the Satisfaction Agreement discussed below.
On October 22, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Satisfaction Agreement”) with SVB as lender, pursuant to which SVB agreed to accept a one-time cash payment of $2,500,000 (the “Satisfaction Payment”) in satisfaction of the Company’s outstanding payment obligations under the SVB Loan Agreement, subject to certain terms and conditions. SVB also agreed to release the security interests and other liens previously granted to or held by SVB as security for the Company’s obligations under the SVB Loan Agreement. The Company made the Satisfaction Payment on October 22, 2020. The remaining balance of $3,062,000, net of discount, as well as $55,000 of accrued interest was forgiven and recorded as a “Gain on Extinguishment of Debt” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has no outstanding obligations under the SVB Loan Agreement.
Future Capital Requirements and Going Concern
As of December 31, 2020, we had $5,277,000 of cash and restricted cash. As of December 31, 2020 and the filing of this Report, we had $2,417,000 of total obligations under the PPP Loan. The Company estimates that approximately $2,266,000 of the PPP Loan will be forgiven. However, this estimate is subject to change and there is no guarantee that the Company will receive any forgiveness for any fixed amount of any PPP Loan principal received by the Company. Our capital requirements in the future will continue to depend on numerous factors, including the timing and amount of revenue for the combined organization, customer renewal rates and the timing of collection of outstanding accounts receivable, in each case particularly as it relates to the combined organization’s major customers, the expense to deliver services, expense for sales and marketing, expense for research and development, capital expenditures, and the amount of forgiveness of the PPP Loan, if any, and the debt service obligations under the PPP Loan. While our acquisition of Oblong Industries provides additional revenues to the Company, the cost to further develop and commercialize Oblong Industries’ product offerings is expected to exceed its revenues for the foreseeable future. We expect to continue to invest in Oblong Industries’ product development and sales and marketing expenses with the goal of growing the Company’s revenue in the future. The Company believes that, based on the combined organization’s current projection of revenue, expenses, capital expenditures, debt service obligations, and cash flows, it will not have sufficient resources to fund its operations for the next twelve months following the filing of this Report. We believe additional capital will be required to fund operations and provide growth capital including investments in technology, product development and sales and marketing. To access capital to fund operations or provide growth capital, we will need to raise capital in one or more debt and/or equity offerings. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising necessary capital or that any such offering will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If we are unable to raise additional capital that may be needed on terms acceptable to us, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The factors discussed above raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from these uncertainties.
See Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding certain additional factors that could impact the Company’s liquidity in the future.
Critical Accounting Policies
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accoutning Principles (“GAAP”). Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 - Business Description and Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements attached hereto. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
Oblong (formerly Glowpoint)
Revenue billed in advance for video collaboration services is deferred until the revenue has been earned, which is when the related services have been performed. Other service revenue, including amounts passed through based on surcharges from our telecom carriers, related to the network services and collaboration services are recognized as service is provided. As the non-refundable, upfront installation and activation fees charged to our customers do not meet the criteria as a separate unit of accounting, they are deferred and recognized over the 12 to 24-month period estimated life of the customer relationship. Revenue related to professional services is recognized at the time the services are performed. Revenues derived from other sources are recognized when services are provided or events occur.
Oblong Industries
The Company accounts for revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Codification Topic 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” Topic 606 requires entities to recognize revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The costs associated with obtaining a customer contract under Topic 606 are deferred on our consolidated balance sheet and amortized over the expected life of the customer.
Oblong Industries’ core platform is g-speak™, and Mezzanine™ is its flagship product built on this platform. Mezzanine™ offers advanced collaboration for conference room technology, which amplifies sales presentations, enhances group collaboration, and makes work sessions more productive. The Company offers g-speak development licenses to larger enterprise customers. The Company’s products are systems that consist of hardware and software that function together to
deliver the system’s essential functionality. The Company sells the systems as a complete package and does not sell the hardware and software separately. The Company also sells maintenance and support contracts and license agreements. The Company has determined that its systems and service contracts have value to a customer on a standalone basis; therefore, revenue from each item should be recognized separately. The Company establishes the relative selling price of each deliverable based on estimated selling price. The Company recognizes product revenue from its systems upon shipment, installation revenue upon completed installation and revenue from maintenance contracts and license agreements ratably over the applicable periods, ranging from 12 to 36 months. Professional service contracts are billed based on time and materials at the contract rate as the services are rendered.
Deferred revenue as of December 31, 2020 totaled $1,723,000 as certain performance obligations were not satisfied as of this date. Deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019 totaled $1,901,000 as certain performance obligations were not satisfied as of this date. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $999,000 of revenue that was included in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Intangible Assets
The Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets used in operations, primarily fixed assets and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets might not be recoverable. For purposes of evaluating the recoverability of fixed assets and amortizing intangible assets, the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are compared to the carrying amounts of those assets. If and when the carrying values of the assets exceed the undiscounted cash flows, then the related assets will be written down to fair value.
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded asset impairment charges on property and equipment of $144,000 and $63,000, respectively, which pertained primarily to assets no longer used in the business. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company disposed of fixed assets of $3,438,000, and the corresponding accumulated depreciation of $3,287,000, which resulted in a loss on disposal of $151,000. There were no impairments to purchased intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded aggregate impairment charges of $465,000 on two right-of-use assets. See Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion. There were no impairments to right-of-use assets for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 350 “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment” (“ASC Topic 350”). As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, goodwill was $7,367,000 and $7,908,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, all of the goodwill was recorded in connection with the October 1, 2019 acquisition of Oblong Industries.
We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on September 30 of each year or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change indicating that the fair value of the goodwill may be below its carrying amount. Prior to the acquisition of Oblong Industries on October 1, 2019, the Company operated as a single reporting unit and used its market capitalization to determine the fair value of the reporting unit as of each test date. In order to determine the market capitalization, the Company used the trailing 20-day volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of its stock as of each period end.
For the Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) reporting unit, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $541,000 and $2,254,000 in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value on the applicable test dates. These charges are recognized as “Impairment Charges” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the Oblong segment no longer has any goodwill included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020.
In the event we experience future declines in our revenue, cash flows and/or stock price, this may give rise to a triggering event that may require the Company to record additional impairment charges on goodwill in the future.
Intangible Assets. Intangible assets total $10,140,000 and $12,572,000 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company assesses the impairment of purchased intangible assets subject to amortization when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets might not be recoverable. The determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments, related primarily to the future profitability and/or future value of the assets. Changes in the Company’s strategic plan and/or other-than-temporary changes in market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and could require adjustments to recorded asset balances. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances has occurred that could have a significant adverse effect on the
fair value of long-lived assets. The Company performed evaluations of intangible assets as of each quarter end during 2019 and 2020 and determined that no impairment charges were required for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets, which range from five to twelve years in accordance with ASC Topic 350 “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment.”
Inflation
Management does not believe inflation had a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements for the periods presented.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.
