Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company advancing novel and potentially lifesaving investigational therapies derived from our Epigenetic Regulator Program. DUR-928, a new chemical entity in clinical development for three different indications, is the lead candidate in our Epigenetic Regulator Program. An endogenous, orally bioavailable small molecule, DUR-928 has been shown in preclinical studies to play an important regulatory role in lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and cell survival. Alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) is a life-threatening acute liver condition with no approved therapeutics and a 28-day historical mortality rate of 26%. After completing a Phase 2a trial where 100% of AH patients treated with DUR-928 survived the 28-day study period, we are now conducting a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial called AHFIRM, in which we are evaluating DUR-928’s life saving potential compared to the current standard of care in patients with severe AH. If the AHFIRM trial is successful, it may support an NDA filing and we may decide to develop our own commercial, sales and marketing organization. DUR-928 is also being investigated in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
In addition to our Epigenetic Regulator Program, we developed a novel and proprietary post-surgical pain product called POSIMIR that utilizes our innovative SABER platform technology to enable continuous sustained delivery of bupivacaine, a non-opioid local analgesic, over 3 days in adults. In February 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved POSIMIR for infiltration use in adults for administration into the subacromial space under direct arthroscopic visualization to produce post-surgical analgesia for up to 72 hours following arthroscopic subacromial decompression. The approval was based on positive data from a randomized, multicenter, assessor-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients undergoing arthroscopic subacromial decompression surgery with an intact rotator cuff. The primary outcome measures were mean pain intensity and total opioid rescue analgesia administered, both evaluated over the first 72 hours after surgery versus placebo. POSIMIR demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in both primary outcome measures: a 1.3 point, or 20%, reduction in mean pain intensity on a 0-10 point pain scale (p=0.01), and a 67% reduction in intravenous morphine-
equivalent rescue opioid use, from a median of 12 mg in the placebo group to 4 mg in the POSIMIR group (p=0.01). We are in discussions with potential licensees regarding commercialization rights to POSIMIR, for which we hold worldwide rights.
As a result of the assignment of certain patent rights, DURECT also receives single digit sales-based earn-out payments from U.S. net sales of Indivior’s PERSERIS (risperidone) drug for schizophrenia, which was launched commercially in the U.S. in February 2019. In addition, in September 2020, our licensee, Orient Pharma informed us that it had launched Methydur (Methydur) for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in Taiwan. We receive a single digit royalty on sales of Methydur by Orient Pharma. We also manufacture and sell osmotic pumps used in laboratory research and have several early-stage development programs with corporate collaborators on terms which typically call for our collaborator to fund all or a substantial portion of future development costs and then pay us milestone payments based on specific development or commercial achievements plus royalties on product sales.
Recent Developments
The COVID-19 global pandemic poses a significant life-threatening and economic risk throughout the world. The rapid spread of the disease has resulted in a pandemic with over 100 million of confirmed cases and millions of deaths worldwide. While most cases result in mild symptoms, including fever, cough and shortness of breath, some rapidly progress into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, and death. Many of these patients may experience severe systemic inflammation that leads to acute injuries in multiple organs including the liver and the kidney.
We continue to actively advance all of our research and development programs, we are assessing on an ongoing basis the impact of COVID-19 on our clinical trials, product candidate testing, expected timelines and costs.
COVID-19 has also had a negative impact on our business. In light of recent developments relating to the COVID-19 global pandemic, the focus of healthcare providers and hospitals has been on the prioritization of healthcare resources toward fighting the virus and clinical site initiations. As a result, patient enrollment and activities that require visits to clinical sites, including data monitoring, have been and may continue to be delayed. We are also evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 on orders for our ALZET product line. In addition, in response to the spread of COVID-19, other than laboratory and manufacturing employees, many of our other employees are working from home, and, in keeping with social distancing requirements, we have limited the number of staff in our facilities. This partial disruption, although expected to be temporary, may impact our operations and overall business by delaying the progress of our research and development programs, including our planned preclinical studies and clinical trials. The impact of COVID-19 is evolving rapidly and its future effects are uncertain. Given the uncertainty of the situation, the duration of the disruption and related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and expect to reevaluate the timing of our anticipated preclinical and clinical objectives as we learn more and the impact of COVID-19 on our industry becomes clearer.
For additional information on the various risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, please read Item 1A. Risk Factors included in this report.
Collaborative Research and Development and Other Revenues
Collaborative research and development and other revenues consist of three broad categories: (a) the recognition of upfront license payments over the period of our continuing involvement with the third party, (b) the reimbursement of qualified research expenses by third parties and (c) milestone payments in connection with our collaborative agreements. During the last three years, we generated collaborative research and development revenues from collaborative agreements with Gilead, Sandoz, Santen and others.
Product Revenues
We also currently generate product revenue from the sale of two product lines:
•
ALZET® osmotic pumps which are used for animal research; and
•
certain key excipients that are included in Methydur and one excipient that is included in a marketed animal health product.
In December 2020, we completed the sale of its LACTEL Absorbable Polymers product line to Evonik Corporation. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Evonik paid us approximately $15 million subject to certain adjustments, and also agreed to assume certain liabilities with respect to the transferred assets and assembled workforce. LACTEL product line is reflected as a discontinued operation in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss and balance sheets. Our financial information discussed in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations excludes the impact of LACTEL product line.
Because we consider our core business to be developing and commercializing pharmaceuticals, we do not intend to significantly increase our investments in or efforts to sell or market any of our existing product lines. However, we expect that we will continue to make efforts to increase our revenues related to collaborative research and development by entering into additional research and development agreements with third-party collaborators to develop product candidates based on our drug delivery technologies.
Operating Results
Since our inception in 1998, we have generally had a history of operating losses. At December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $489.8 million. Our net losses were $582,000, $20.6 million and $25.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred to research and develop our product candidates and to a lesser extent, from selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations and product sales. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in 2021 compared to 2020 as we experience higher research and development expenses related to DUR-928. We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in 2021 compared to 2020. We do not anticipate meaningful revenues from our products in development, should they be approved, for at least the next twelve months. Therefore, we expect to incur continuing losses and negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The most significant estimates and assumptions relate to inventories and purchase commitments, revenue recognition, contract research liabilities, and stock-based compensation. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates.
Revenue Recognition
Product Revenues, Net
We manufacture and sell ALZET osmotic pumps used in laboratory research, and manufacture and sell certain excipients for use as raw materials in certain products, including an animal health product and Methydur.
Revenues from product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon shipment to the customer. We expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that we would have recognized is one year or less.
Trade Discounts and Allowances: We provide certain customers with discounts that are explicitly stated in our contracts and are recorded as a reduction of revenues in the period the related product revenues are recognized.
Product Returns: Consistent with industry practice, we generally offer customers a limited right of return for products that have been purchased from us. We estimate the amount of our product sales that may be returned by our customers and record this estimate as a reduction of revenues in the period the related product revenues is recognized. We currently estimate product return liabilities using our own historical sales information. We expect product returns to be minimal.
Collaborative Research and Development Revenues
We enter into license agreements under which we license certain rights to our product candidates to third parties. The terms of these arrangements typically include payment to us of one or more of the following: non-refundable, up-front license fees; reimbursement of development costs incurred by us under approved work plans; development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments; payments for manufacturing supply services we provide through our contract manufacturers; sales-based milestones and royalties on net sales of licensed products. Each of these payments results in collaborative research and development revenues, except for revenues from royalties or earn-out payments on net sales of licensed products, which are classified as other revenues.
In determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as we fulfill our obligations under each of our agreements, we perform the following steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. As part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. We use key assumptions to determine the stand-alone selling price, which may include forecasted revenues, development timelines, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, discount rates and probabilities of technical and regulatory success. We expect to recognize revenue for the variable consideration currently being constrained when it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur.
Licenses of intellectual property: If the license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenues from non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from non-refundable, up-front fees. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.
Milestone Payments: At the inception of each arrangement that includes development milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within the control of us or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such development milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up
basis, which would affect collaborative research and development revenues and net income (loss) in the period of adjustment.
Manufacturing Supply Services: Arrangements that include a promise for future supply of drug product for either clinical development or commercial supply at the customer’s discretion are generally considered options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the customer and if so, they are accounted for as separate performance obligations. If we are entitled to additional payments when the customer exercises these options, any additional payments are recorded in collaborative research and development revenues when the customer obtains control of the goods, which is upon delivery.
Royalties and Earn-outs: For arrangements that include sales-based royalties or earn-outs, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty or earn-out has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, we have not recognized material royalty revenue resulting from our collaborative arrangements or material earn-out revenue from our patent purchase agreement with Indivior.
Prepaid and Accrued Contract Research Expenses
We incur significant costs associated with third party consultants and organizations for pre-clinical studies, clinical trials, contract manufacturing, validation, testing, regulatory advice and other research and development-related services. We are required to estimate periodically the cost of services rendered but unbilled based on management’s estimates of project status. If these good faith estimates are inaccurate, actual expenses incurred could materially differ from our estimates.
Stock-Based Compensation
Employee stock-based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the employee stock award’s fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite period.
We estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock. We base the risk-free rate that we use in the Black-Scholes option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms. We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the Black-Scholes option valuation model. We estimated forfeitures at the time of grant and revised those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We used historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and recorded stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. Upon the adoption of ASU 2016-09, we account for forfeitures as they occur and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that vest. We amortize the fair value of options granted on a straight-line basis. All options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods. We may elect to use different assumptions under the Black-Scholes option valuation model in the future, which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share.
Results of Operations
Comparison of years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018
Collaborative research and development and other revenues
We recognize revenues from collaborative research and development activities and service contracts. Collaborative research and development revenue primarily represents reimbursement of qualified expenses related to collaborative agreements with various third parties to research, develop and commercialize potential products using our drug delivery technologies, and revenue from the recognition of upfront fees and milestone payments in connection with our collaborative agreements.
We expect our collaborative research and development and other revenues to fluctuate in future periods pending our efforts to enter into potential new collaborations, our existing third-party collaborators’ commitment to and progress in the research and development programs, and any royalty or earn-out revenue recognized from collaborators or counterparties. The collaborative research and development and other revenues associated with our major collaborators or counterparties are as follows (in thousands):
(1)
Amounts related to recognition of upfront fees and milestone payments were $22.7 million, $12.3 million and zero for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We signed a license agreement with Gilead on July 19, 2019 and received a nonrefundable upfront license fee and a milestone payment totaling $35.0 million in 2019 which was being recognized as revenue as our obligation was being satisfied using the cost-to-cost input method (see Note 2 Strategic Agreements - Agreement with Gilead Sciences, Inc. in the financial statements). In June 2020, we received notice that Gilead was terminating the License Agreement and a related R&D agreement between Gilead and us. As a result, we recognized all our remaining deferred revenue as there were no remaining substantive performance obligations to be provided to Gilead by the Company as of the date when the termination notice was received. Amounts recognized as revenue during each of the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 also included our reimbursable collaborative research and development services performed under our agreement with Gilead.
(2)
Includes: (a) amounts related to earn-out revenue from Indivior UK Limited (Indivior) with respect to PERSERIS net sales; (b) feasibility programs; (c) research and development activities funded by Santen Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Santen) and (d) royalty revenue from OP Pharma with respect to Methydur net sales. Note that in January 2018, we were notified by Santen that due to a shift in priorities, Santen had elected to reallocate research and development resources and put our program on pause until further notice. While the main program is on pause, the parties are working together on a limited set of research and development activities funded by Santen.
The increase in collaborative research and development revenues in 2020 compared with 2019 was primarily due to higher revenue recognized from our agreement with Gilead and higher revenue recognized from our agreements with Indivior, Santen and feasibility agreements with other companies.
The increase in collaborative research and development revenues in 2019 compared with 2018 was primarily due to higher revenue recognized from our agreement with Gilead, partially offset by lower revenue recognized from our agreements with Indivior, Santen and feasibility agreements with other companies.
We received a $25.0 million upfront fee in connection with the license agreement signed with Gilead in July 2019 and in October 2019, we also received a $10 million milestone payment from Gilead for further development of the product candidate. Through December 31, 2020, all these amounts had been recognized as revenue as there were no remaining substantive performance obligations to be provided to Gilead by the Company as of the date when the termination notice was received.
We received a $2.0 million upfront fee in connection with the license agreement signed with Santen in December 2014. The $2.0 million upfront fee was being recognized as collaborative research and development revenue over the term of our continuing involvement with Santen. At December 31, 2020, $1.2 million of the $2.0 million upfront fee had been recognized as revenue.
As of March 1, 2021, we had potential milestones of up to $76.0 million that we may receive in the future under our collaborative arrangements, of which $13.0 million are development-based milestones
and $63.0 million are sales-based milestones. Within the category of development-based milestones, $2.0 million are related to early stage clinical testing (defined as Phase 1 or 2 activities), $3.0 million are related to late stage clinical testing (defined as Phase 3 activities), $3.0 million are related to regulatory filings, and $5.0 million are related to regulatory approvals. No payments were received between December 31, 2020 and March 1, 2021, and we do not anticipate receiving any of these milestone revenues within the next twelve months, if at all.
Product revenues
In December 2020, we completed the sale of our LACTEL Absorbable Polymers product line to Evonik Corporation. Revenue from LACTEL product line, related cost of product revenues, associated research and development and selling, general and administrative has been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented.
A portion of our revenues is derived from product sales, which include our ALZET osmotic pump product line, and certain excipients that are included in Methydur and in a marketed animal health product. Net product revenues were $6.2 million, $6.9 million, and $7.1 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The decrease in product revenues in 2020 was primarily attributable to lower revenue from our ALZET osmotic pump product line as a result of lower units sold compared to 2019. The unit sales of this product line were particularly impacted when the effects of COVID-19 noticeably impacted our customers’ ability to conduct their research and development activities and therefore the demand for our osmotic pumps during the first three quarters of 2020.
The decrease in product revenues in 2019 was primarily attributable to slightly lower revenue from our ALZET osmotic pump product line as a result of lower units sold compared to 2018.
Cost of product revenues
Cost of product revenues was $1.4 million, $1.3 million and $1.6 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cost of product revenues includes the cost of product revenue from our ALZET product line, and certain excipients that are included in several products in development, Methydur and a marketed animal health product.
Excluding a one-time settlement credit of $500,000 related to certain excipients that are included in Methydur and in a currently marketed animal health product in 2019, cost of product revenue in 2020 was slightly lower primarily due to lower cost of goods sold related to our ALZET product line arising from lower units sold compared to the corresponding period in 2019.
Excluding the one-time settlement credit of $500,000 related to certain excipients that are included in Methydur and in a marketed animal health product, cost of product revenue in 2019 increased primarily due to higher manufacturing costs for our ALZET product line compared to the corresponding period in 2018.
Stock-based compensation expense related to cost of product revenues was $13,000, $13,000, and $13,000, in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
As of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we had 9 manufacturing employees, respectively.
Research and development. Research and development expenses are primarily comprised of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and other compensation cost associated with research and development personnel, overhead and facility costs, preclinical and non-clinical development costs, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs, contract services, and other outside costs. Research and development expenses were $27.7 million, $29.6 million, and $25.0 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense recognized related to research and development personnel was $981,000, $746,000, and $1.5 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in 2021 compared to 2020 as we expect to incur higher research and development expenses related to DUR-928.
Research and development expenses decreased by $1.9 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in 2020 was primarily attributable to lower research and development costs associated with POSIMIR and the Gilead program, partially offset by higher research and development costs associated with DUR-928, depot injectable and other research programs compared to 2019, as more fully discussed below.
Research and development expenses increased by $4.6 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in 2019 was primarily attributable to higher research and development costs associated with DUR-928 and the Gilead program, partially offset by lower research and development costs associated with POSIMIR, depot injectable and other research programs compared to 2018, as more fully discussed below.
Research and development expenses associated with our major development programs after the
removal of the effects of our sale of the LACTEL product line were as follows (in thousands):
(1)
See Note 2 Strategic Agreements in the financial statements for more details about our agreements with Gilead.
DUR-928
Our research and development expenses for DUR-928 increased to $21.3 million in 2020 from $20.1 million in 2019, primarily due to higher contract manufacturing expenses and higher employee related costs for this drug candidate compared with 2019.
Our research and development expenses for DUR-928 increased to $20.1 million in 2019 from $14.8 million in 2018, primarily due to higher clinical trial expenses incurred.
It is too early to assess the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business, including our ongoing DUR-928 Phase 2b trial in alcoholic hepatitis, but COVID-19 may delay enrollment and data analysis for our DUR-928 clinical trials.
POSIMIR
Our research and development expenses for POSIMIR decreased to $3.7 million in 2020 from $4.6 million in 2019, primarily due to lower outside expenses as well as lower employee-related expenses for POSIMIR.
Our research and development expenses for POSIMIR decreased to $4.6 million in 2019 from $6.6 million in 2018, primarily due to lower outside expenses as well as lower employee-related expenses for POSIMIR.
It is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely impact our efforts to out-license POSIMIR commercial rights and the timing of potential commercialization of POSIMIR.
Gilead Program
Our research and development expenses for the Gilead program decreased to $1.0 million in 2020 from $3.8 million in 2019, primarily due to lower employee-related costs and outside costs devoted to the program. In 2020, Gilead terminated the Gilead Agreement and a related R&D agreement between us.
Our research and development expenses for the Gilead program increased to $3.8 million in 2019 from $2.2 million in 2018, primarily due to higher employee-related costs and outside costs for the program.
Depot injectable programs
Our research and development expenses for depot injectable programs increased to $862,000 in 2020 from $599,000 in 2019 primarily due to higher employee-related costs and higher outside expenses for these programs.
Our research and development expenses for depot injectable programs decreased to $599,000 in 2019 from $697,000 in 2018 primarily due to lower employee-related costs and lower research supplies expenses for these programs.
Other DURECT research programs
Our research and development expenses for all other research activities increased to $871,000 in 2020 from $500,000 in 2019, primarily due to higher employee-related costs incurred for these programs.
Our research and development expenses for all other research activities decreased to $500,000 in 2019 from $632,000 in 2018, primarily due to lower employee-related costs incurred for these programs.
As of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we had 46, 43, and 45 research and development employees, respectively.
We cannot reasonably estimate the timing and costs of our research and development programs due to the risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceuticals as outlined in the “Risk Factors” section of this report. The duration of development of our research and development programs may span as many as ten years or more, and estimation of completion dates or costs to complete would be highly speculative and subjective due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products, including significant and changing government regulation, the uncertainties of future preclinical and clinical study results, uncertainties related to the COVID-19 outbreak, the uncertainties with our collaborators’ commitment to and progress in the programs and the uncertainties associated with process development and manufacturing as well as sales and marketing. In addition, with respect to our development programs subject to third-party collaborations, the timing and expenditures to complete the programs are subject to the control of our collaborators. Therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate the timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the research and development programs. For additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties, see “Risk Factors” above.
Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily comprised of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with finance, legal, business development, sales and marketing (including sales and marketing expenses for our ALZET product line) and other administrative personnel, overhead and facility costs, and other general and administrative costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $13.6 million, $14.1 million, and $12.3 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense recognized related to selling, general and administrative personnel was $1.1 million, $1.3 million, and $1.4 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in 2021 compared to 2020.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $504,000 in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower stock-based compensation expenses related to selling, general and administrative personnel as well as lower legal and patent expenses in 2020 compared with 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $1.9 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher legal and patent expenses in 2019 compared with 2018.
As of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we had 26, 22, and 22 selling, general and administrative personnel, respectively.
Other income (expense). Interest and other income was $517,000, $1.1 million, and $870,000 in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The decrease in interest and other income in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily the result of lower interest income generated as a result of lower interest rates associated with our cash and investments in 2020 compared with 2019. The increase in interest and other income in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily the result of higher interest income generated as a result of higher average investment balances in 2019 compared with 2018.
Interest expense was $2.2 million, $2.5 million and $2.6 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The decrease in interest expense in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to lower interest rates associated with the term loan with Oxford Finance in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease
in interest expense in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to lower interest rates associated with the term loan in 2019 compared to 2018.
Income taxes. As of December 31, 2020, we had net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $344.7 million, of which approximately $306.3 million will expire in the years 2021 through 2037, and approximately $38.5 million will not expire. As of December 31, 2020, we had federal research and development tax credits of approximately $15.6 million, which expire at various dates beginning in 2021 through 2040, if not utilized. As of December 31, 2020, we had NOL carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately $219.1 million, which expire in the years 2021 through 2040, and state research and development tax credits of approximately $16.7 million, which do not expire. Utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to federal and state ownership change limitations. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had net deferred tax assets of $114.3 million and $117.2 million, respectively. Deferred tax assets reflect the net tax effects of net operating loss and credit carryforwards and the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Accordingly, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance.
Because realization of such tax benefits is uncertain, we provided a 100% valuation allowance as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Utilization of the NOL and R&D credits carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future provided by Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as well as similar state and foreign provisions. These ownership changes may limit the amount of NOL and R&D credits carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an ownership change is defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating losses and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research and development credit carryforwards) to offset its post-change taxable income or taxes may be limited. Since our formation, we have raised capital through the issuance of capital stock on several occasions which, combined with the purchasing shareholders’ subsequent disposition of those shares, may have resulted in a change of control, as defined by Section 382, or could result in a change of control in the future upon subsequent disposition. We issued $60.0 million of convertible notes in 2003 and subsequently all of these notes had been converted as of December 31, 2008 into approximately 19.0 million shares of our common stock. We also issued approximately 4.4 million shares of our common stock to an institutional investor in connection with an equity financing in September 2009. In December 2012, November 2013, April 2016, June 2019 and February 2021, we completed underwritten public offerings in which we sold an aggregate of approximately 14.0 million, 8.2 million and 13.8 million, 29.0 million and 20.4 million shares, respectively, of our common stock pursuant to effective registration statements. In 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and the first two months of 2021, we issued approximately 5.2 million, 8.9 million, 9.6 million, 2.3 million, 5.3 million and 950,000 shares, respectively, of our common stock in the open market through Controlled Equity Offering sales agreements with Cantor Fitzgerald pursuant to effective registration statements. These transactions may also have resulted in a change of control as defined by Section 382 or could result in a change of control in the future upon the subsequent disposition of the shares.
We have not currently completed a study to assess whether a change in control has occurred or whether there have been multiple changes of control since our formation due to the significant complexity and cost associated with such a study and the fact that there could be additional changes in the future. If we have experienced a change of control at any time since our formation, utilization of our NOL or R&D credits carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation under Sections 382 and 383 which is determined by first multiplying the value of our stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate, and then could be subject to additional adjustments, as required. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of our NOL or R&D credits carryforwards before utilization. Tax years 1998 to 2020 remain subject to future examination by the major tax jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We had cash, cash equivalents, cash held in escrow and investments totaling $56.9 million and $64.8 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This includes $150,000 of interest-bearing marketable securities classified as restricted investments on our balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, which primarily serve as collateral for a letter of credit securing a leased facility in California. The letter of credit for our leased facility in California will expire in February 2024. In February 2021, we raised net proceeds of $47.8 million from an underwritten public offering and other sales of equity under the Controlled Equity Offering program with Cantor Fitzgerald.
We used $38.8 million and $19.8 million of cash in operating activities in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2018, respectively, and generated $11.1 million of cash in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2019. The cash provided by or used for operations was primarily to fund operations as well as working capital requirements. Our cash provided by or used in operating activities differs from our net loss in part due to the timing and recognition of up-front payments under collaborative agreements. Depending on the nature of the upfront payments received upon execution of collaborative agreements, which can either be recognized as revenue upfront in full or primarily recorded as deferred revenue and generally recognized over the period using a basis that best reflects the satisfaction of our performance obligations with the third-party collaborator pursuant to the applicable agreement. The increase in cash used in operating activities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to lower payments received from collaboration partners and customers, partially offset by the changes in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, and accrued and other liabilities. The generation of $11.1 million of cash from operating activities in 2019 was primarily due to the receipt of $35.0 million in payments from Gilead, partially offset by the changes in accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and other assets, and accrued and other liabilities compared to $19.8 million of cash used in operating activities in 2018.
We generated $24.5 million and $4.5 million of cash from investing activities in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2018, and used $27.3 million of cash in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively. The increase in cash received from investing activities in 2020 was primarily due to cash received in escrow from the sale of the LACTEL product line in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in cash received from investing activities in 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from maturities of available-for-sale securities in 2019 compared to 2018. We anticipate incurring capital expenditures of approximately $100,000 over the next 12 months. The amount and timing of these capital expenditures will depend on, among other things, our research and development activities and needs, and the need for equipment replacements.
We generated $15.7 million, $19.5 million, and $17.5 million of cash from financing activities in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in cash received from financing activities in 2020 was primarily due to lower net proceeds received from issuances of common stock in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in cash received from financing activities in 2019 was primarily due to higher net proceeds received from issuances of common stock in 2019 compared to 2018. In 2020, we raised net proceeds of approximately $12.3 million from the sale of 5,308,002 shares of the Company’s common stock in the open market at a weighted average price of $2.39 per share pursuant to the October 2019 registration statement. In June 2019, we entered into a privately negotiated transaction to sell 29,000,000 shares of our common stock to certain investors in a registered offering at a price of $0.52 per share, raising total net proceeds to us of approximately $15 million. In 2019, we also raised net proceeds (net of commission) of approximately $3.5 million from the sale of 2.3 million shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $1.55 per share in the open market through our Controlled Equity Offering sales agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald.
In November 2015, we entered into the 2015 Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald, acting as agent. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 24.6 million registered shares of common stock were sold through the 2015 Sales Agreement for total net proceeds (net of commissions) of approximately $38.3 million. In August 2018, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which upon being declared effective in October 2018 and allowed us to offer up to $175.0 million of securities from time to time in one or more public offerings, inclusive of up to $75.0 million of additional shares of common stock which we may sell, subject to certain limitations, under the 2015 Sales Agreement through
Cantor Fitzgerald, acting as agent. Any additional sales in the public market of our common stock, under the Controlled Equity Offering program with Cantor Fitzgerald or otherwise under the October 2018 shelf registration statement, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.
In February 2021, we completed an underwritten public offering of 20,364,582 shares of its common stock at a price of $2.2386 per share pursuant to an underwriting agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., raising total gross proceeds to us of approximately $45.6 million before deducting estimated offering expenses payable by us. Total stock issuance costs related to this financing were approximately $195,000. After deducting estimated offering expenses payable by us, the net proceeds to us were approximately $45.4 million. From January 1, 2021 to March 1, 2021, we also raised net proceeds (net of commissions) of approximately $2.4 million from the sale of 950,009 shares of our common stock in the open market at a weighted average price of $2.60 per share pursuant to the October 2018 registration statement. As of March 1, 2021, we had up to approximately $56.2 million of common stock available for sale under the Controlled Equity Offering program and approximately $45.3 million of common stock available for sale under our shelf registration statement.
In July 2016, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the Loan Agreement) with Oxford Finance LLC (Oxford Finance), pursuant to which Oxford Finance provided a $20.0 million secured single-draw term loan to us with an initial maturity date of August 1, 2020. The term loan was fully drawn at close and the proceeds may be used for working capital and general business requirements. The term loan repayment schedule provided initially for interest only payments for the first 18 months, followed by consecutive monthly payments of principal and interest in arrears starting on March 1, 2018 and continuing through the maturity date of August 1, 2020. Following three amendments, we make interest only payments under the amended Loan Agreement until December 1, 2021 and the final maturity date of the loan is May 1, 2024. The Loan Agreement provides for a floating interest rate (7.95% initially and 7.95% as of December 31, 2020) based on an index rate plus a spread and an additional payment equal to 10% of the principal amount of the term loan, which is due when the term loan becomes due or upon the prepayment of the facility. If we elect to prepay the loan, there is also a prepayment fee between 0.75% and 2.5% of the principal amount of the term loan depending on the timing of prepayment. Our debt repayment obligations under the Loan Agreement, as amended, may prove a burden to the Company as they become due, particularly following the expiration of the interest-only period.
The term loan is secured by substantially all of our assets, except that the collateral does not include any intellectual property (including licensing, collaboration and similar agreements relating thereto), and certain other excluded assets. The Loan Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by us, which covenants limit our ability to convey, sell, lease, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of certain assets; engage in any business other than the businesses currently engaged in by us or reasonably related thereto; liquidate or dissolve; make certain management changes; undergo certain change of control events; create, incur, assume, or be liable with respect to certain indebtedness; grant certain liens; pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments; make certain investments; and make payments on any subordinated debt.
The Loan Agreement also contains customary indemnification obligations and customary events of default, including, among other things, our failure to fulfill certain obligations under the 2016 Loan Agreement and the occurrence of a material adverse change which is defined as a material adverse change in our business, operations, or condition (financial or otherwise), a material impairment of the prospect of repayment of any portion of the loan, or a material impairment in the perfection or priority of lender’s lien in the collateral or in the value of such collateral. In the event of default by us under the 2016 Loan Agreement, the lender would be entitled to exercise its remedies thereunder, including the right to accelerate the debt, upon which we may be required to repay all amounts then outstanding under the Loan Agreement. As a result, that portion of the term loan that was due more than 12 months after December 31, 2020 was classified within non-current liabilities.
Cash used in our operating activities is heavily influenced by the timing and structure of new corporate collaborations. While one feature of our business strategy is seeking new corporate collaborations, assuming no new collaborations and no milestone payments, we anticipate that cash used in operating activities will increase in the near term.
The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting our business in several ways. Sales of our ALZET product line were negatively impacted in 2020 by COVID-19 and the future impact on sales of our ALZET product line are uncertain. For DUR-928, we may experience delays and increased expenses in the recruitment and running of the ongoing Phase 2b clinical trial in patients with AH, and some patients who completed dosing of the Phase 1b clinical trial in NASH were not able to complete their follow up visits. These losses, delays and additional expenses will increase our expenses. Additional volatility in capital markets and/or clinical trial delays resulting from the impacts of COVID-19 may also limit our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms, if at all.
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments including proceeds received from our February 2021 stock offering will be sufficient to fund our planned operations, existing debt and contractual commitments and planned capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months from the date the financial statements are filed. We may consume available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated, resulting in the need for additional funding. Additionally, we do not expect to generate significant revenues from our pharmaceutical products currently under development for at least the next twelve months, if at all. Depending on whether we enter into additional collaborative agreements in the near term and the extent to which we earn revenues from our collaborative agreements, we may decide to raise additional capital through a variety of sources, including:
•
the public equity markets;
•
private equity financings;
•
collaborative arrangements; and/or
•
public or private debt.
There can be no assurance that we will enter into additional collaborative agreements or maintain existing collaborative agreements in the near term, will earn collaborative revenues or that additional capital will be available on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to significantly reduce or refocus our operations or to obtain funds through arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our products, technologies or potential markets, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities would result in ownership dilution to our existing stockholders (assuming convertible debt securities were converted into shares).
Our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations. We select investments that maximize interest income to the extent possible given these two constraints. We satisfy liquidity requirements by investing excess cash in securities with different maturities to match projected cash needs and limit concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit-quality issuers.
In 2020, there were no significant changes in our commercial commitments and contractual obligations. In aggregate, we are required to make future payments pursuant to our existing contractual obligations as follows (in thousands):
(1)
Includes principal, interest payments and final payments and assumes no acceleration of obligations.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2019, as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in the accounting standards, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”), which eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intra-period tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. ASU 2019-12 also clarifies and simplifies other aspects of the accounting for income taxes. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted ASU 2019-12 on January 1, 2020, and this adoption had no material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
In November 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued ASU No. 2018-18, Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808): Clarifying the Interaction between Topic 808 and Topic 606 (ASU 2018-18). ASU 2018-18 clarifies that certain transactions between collaborative arrangement participants should be accounted for as revenue under Topic 606 when the counterparty is a customer for a distinct good or service (i.e., a unit of account). For units of account that are in the scope of Topic 606, all of the guidance in Topic 606 should be applied, including the guidance on recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. ASU 2018-18 also adds a reference in Topic 808 to the unit of account guidance in ASC 606 and requires that it be applied only to assess whether transactions in a collaborative arrangement are in the scope of Topic 606. ASU 2018-18 will preclude entities from presenting amounts related to transactions with a counterparty in a collaborative arrangement that is not a customer as revenue from contracts with customers. ASU 2018-18 is effective for the Company for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which eliminates certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements for all entities, requires public entities to disclose certain new information and modifies some disclosure requirements. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim reporting periods within those years. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, (ASU 2017-04). ASU 2017-04 eliminated Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, under the amendments in ASU 2017-04, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. ASU 2017-04 is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 (ASU 2016-13) “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” ASU 2016-13 requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 for small reporting companies, including interim reporting periods within those years and must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach, with certain exceptions. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on its financial statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not utilized “off-balance sheet” arrangements to fund our operations or otherwise manage our financial position.
