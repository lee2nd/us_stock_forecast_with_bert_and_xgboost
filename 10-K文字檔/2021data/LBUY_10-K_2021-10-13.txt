Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. The discussions of results, causes and trends should not be construed to imply any conclusion that these results or trends will necessarily continue into the future.
We were initially formed as AP Event, Inc., (“APEI”) a Nevada corporation on October 16, 2014. APEI was originally in the business of travel agency to provide individual and group leisure tours to music festivals, and concerts combined with local excursions. On March 21, 2017 LB Media Group, LLC (“LB Media”) acquired eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding common stock of APEI. On March 23, 2017, APEI consummated an Agreement and Plan Merger (“Merger”) with LB Media and LB Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of APEI, whereby LB Acquisition was merged with and into LB Media Group, LLC. Simultaneously with the Merger, of APEI accepted subscriptions in a private placement (“Private Offering”) of our common stock. As a result of the Merger, LB Media became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant and following the consummation of the Merger and giving effect to the securities sold in the Private Offering, the members of LB Media beneficially own approximately fifty-five percent (55%) of our issued and outstanding common stock.
On March 24, 2017, we amended our Articles of Incorporation (the “Amendment”) to (i) change our name to LeafBuyer Technologies, Inc., (ii) to increase the number of our authorized shares of capital stock from 75,000,000 to 160,000,000 shares of which 150,000,000 shares were designated common stock, par value $0.001 per share and 10,000,000 shares were designated “blank check” preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share and (iii) to effect a forward split such that 9.25 shares of our common stock were issued for every 1 share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Amendment (the “Split”).
On April 19, 2018, we entered into a Standby Equity Distribution Agreement (the “SEDA”) with YA II PN Ltd. (“YA Investor”), a Cayman Island exempt limited partnership and an affiliate of Yorkville Advisors Global, LLC, whereby we sold, and the YA Investor purchased, 869,565 shares of our common stock for one million dollars ($1,000,000). Additionally, under the SEDA we may sell to the YA Investor up to $5,000,000 of shares of our common stock over a two-year commitment period. Under the terms of the SEDA, we may, from time to time, in our discretion, sell newly issued shares of our common stock to the YA Investor at a discount to market of 8% of the lowest daily volume weighted average price during the relevant pricing period. We are obligated to register the initial shares, the Commitment Shares (as defined below), and the shares of common stock issuable under the SEDA pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act.
During October and November 2018, we used the SEDA to receive $1,045,000. We issued 1,116,738 shares of our common stock which were valued at fair market at the date issued.
On November 6, 2018, we acquired a customer facing software (“Loyalty Software”) through a Stock Purchase Agreement, in which we acquired all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Greenlight Technologies, Inc. (“GTI”) from its shareholders. At the time of the transaction, there were no employees working for GTI, no systems and no assets, other than the Loyalty Software. GTI’s legal entity was dissolved in the transaction and the Loyalty Software was assumed by us. Management determined that the purchase of GTI did not constitute a business purchase and recorded the transaction as a purchase of software. The consideration for the Loyalty Software was 2,916,667 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share and cash of approximately $450,000. Total value of the Loyalty Software was estimated at approximately $3,010,000. During the year ended June 30, 2020 an additional 366,667 of our shares of common stock (for a value of $262,500) was issued to shareholders of GTI as final settlement of the purchase agreement.
We issued 30,299,998 shares of common stock for the private placement and the issuance of Series C Warrants. We received approximately $4,060,000, net of the placement fees, legal and other expenses incurred for the placement of the shares. The Investors received Series A Warrants to allow the Investors to purchase an aggregate of 7,018,091 shares of our common stock, and Series B Warrants to allow the Investors to purchase an aggregate of 28,072,364 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $0.1603 per common stock share.
Our equity incentive plan was amended and restated by our Board of Directors in April 2020 to increase the number of options available from 10,000,000 to 20,000,000.
Business Overview
Our wholly owned subsidiary, LB Media Group, LLC has evolved and grown from a listing website to a comprehensive marketing technology platform. Our clients, medical and recreational dispensaries in legalized cannabis states, along with cannabis product companies subscribe to our technology platform to assist in new customer acquisition and provide retention tools that include texting/loyalty and ordering ahead technology.
The Leafbuyer Technology Platform reaches millions of cannabis consumers every month through its web-based platform, loyalty platform and smart application technology. Our website’s sophisticated vendor dashboard allows our clients to update menus, deals and create real-time messages to communicate to consumers 24/7. The platform also provides a robust reporting feature to track the vendors’ return on investment. With the increased popularity of Leafbuyer texting/loyalty program, clients can communicate through SMS, MMS as well as push notifications within a custom branded application. Our website, Leafbuyer.com, and its progressive web application hosts a robust search algorithm similar to popular travel or hotel sites, where our clients customers can search the database for appealing offers. They can also search through thousands of menu items and products, create a profile, sign up to receive deal alerts and place online orders for pick up or delivery. In November of 2020 Leafbuyer Technologies Inc. completed a customizable white label application for the dispensary clients. Consumers have the ability to search, shop, earn rewards, place orders and communicate with their favorite stores all in one convenient application. The application can also be completely branded for the dispensary and allows for 24/7 communication with their patrons.
We continue an aggressive push into all legal cannabis states. Increasing our marketing and sales presence in new markets is a primary objective. Along with this expansion, we continue to develop new technologies that will serve cannabis dispensaries and product companies in attracting and retaining consumers.
Leafbuyer operates in a rapidly evolving and highly regulated industry that, as has been estimated by grandviewresearch.com, to exceed $70 billion in revenue by the year 2028. Our founders and our Board of Directors has been, and will continue to be, aggressive in pursuing long-term opportunities.
We plan to grow organically through the aggressive deployment of sales and marketing resources into legal cannabis states. We understand that to obtain significant market share in the industry in the future will require us to look for acquisitions for a significant portion of that growth. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate and acquire such opportunities or that they will be on terms that are favorable to us.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, we have suffered recurring losses from operations and have a significant accumulated deficit. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Results of Operations for the years ended June 30, 2021 versus June 30, 2020
The following table summarizes the results of operations for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020:
Revenues
During the year ended June 30, 2021, we generated $2,666,829 of revenues, compared to revenues of $2,528,356 during the year ended June 30, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the increase in text services which is up 15% over the prior year. In addition, during fiscal year 2020 we had approximately $300,000 in revenue obtained through a partnership with a company selling tradeshow booths. Excluding that revenue, our “normalized” revenue (for comparison purposes) would be $2,676,537 vs $2,228,356 for an increase of $448,181 or 20.5%.
Gross Profit
Gross profit decreased to $723,147 for the period ended June 30, 2021 which was an decrease of $37,355 over the same period last year of June 30, 2020. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from 30% to 27% for the period ended June 30, 2021 over June 30, 2020 because of the increased 3rd party software development costs expended on the technology platform.
Expenses
During the year ended June 30, 2021, we incurred total operating expenses of $3,054,637, including $2,190,441 in general and administrative expenses, and $864,196 in selling expenses. During the year ended June 30, 2020, we incurred total operating expenses of $5,252,505, including $4,409,769 in general and administrative expenses, and $842,736 in selling expenses. The decrease of $2,197,869 or 42% was primarily due to less payroll expense, stock based compensation expense and lower general and administrative expense. We have increased sales automating and enhanced their technology platform for significant cost savings. Management expects the general and administrative expenses to continue to decrease as management focuses on getting current operations to positive cash flow.
We did not properly record a derivative liability related to the 55% conversion feature in the Series A preferred stock in prior periods. We corrected this error by recording a liability and charging this amount against retained earnings as of June 30, 2019. Each period thereafter we are required to perform a mark to market adjustment to the derivative liability. During the period ended June 30, 2021 we recorded an unrealized loss of $2,825,661 the estimated fair value of the derivative changed at the end of the period. During this same period in 2020, the estimated fair value of the derivative decreased therefore the liability was reduced generating unrealized income of $6,811,623.
Other income during the period ended June 30, 2021 was the result of the SBA PPP loan forgiveness of $602,478, offset by recurring interest expense. Interest expense was $478,388 for the yearend June 30, 2021 compared to interest expense of $1,017,244 for the same period ending June 30, 2020 because of the reduction in notes payable during the year.
Net Loss
During the year ended June 30, 2021 we incurred a net loss of $5,029,380, compared to a net profit of $1,302,375 for the year ended June 30, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months from the date of the issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements with existing cash on hand and/or the private placement of common stock or obtaining debt financing. There is, however, no assurance that the we will be able to raise any additional capital through any type of offering on terms acceptable to us, as we believe that existing cash on hand will be insufficient to finance operations over the next twelve months.
At June 30, 2021 we had $684,639 in cash and cash equivalents.
Cash Flows
Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities were as follows:
As of June 30, 2021, we had $684,639 in cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficit of $8,840,068. We are dependent on funds raised through equity financing. Our cumulative net loss of $24,806,182 was funded by equity financing. During the year ended June 30, 2021, we raised gross proceeds of $557,977 in cash proceeds through government supported disaster relief programs.
During the year ended June 30, 2021, we used $858,250 in operating activities compared to $2,808,559 for the same period ending June 30, 2020. The difference is primarily because of the lower net loss from operations realized in fiscal year 2021.
During the year ended June 30, 2021, we did not use any cash for investing activities compared to June 30, 2020 and the use of $559,667 primarily related to the enhancements of our software.
Net cash flow provided by financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2021 was $232,977 compared to $4,496,491 of financing activity in 2020 related to proceeds from the sale of stock of $4,037,888, $1,102,478 proceeds from government supported disaster relief programs and $615,000 borrowings from related parties offset by reduction in notes payable of $1,258,875.
Our decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended June 30, 2021 was primarily net cash used for operating activities.
During the year ended June 30, 2021, our monthly cash requirements to fund our operating activities, was approximately $85,000, compared to approximately $100,000 during the year ended June 30, 2020. In the absence of the continued sale of our common and preferred stock or advances from related parties, our cash of $700,219 as of June 30, 2021 is insufficient to cover our current monthly burn rate for next twelve months.
Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months from the date of the issuance of these consolidated financial statements with existing cash on hand and/or the private placement of common stock. There is, however, no assurance that we will be able to raise any additional capital through any type of offering on terms acceptable to us, as we believe that existing cash on hand will be insufficient to finance operations over the next twelve months.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our audited financial statements are affected by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. A complete summary of these policies is included in Note 2 of the notes to our audited financial statements. We have identified below the accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and which require the application of significant judgment by our management.
For revenue recognition arrangements that we determine are within the scope of Topic ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to arrangements that meet the definition of a contract under Topic 606, including when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606, we evaluate the goods or services promised within each contract related performance obligation and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.
We recognize revenue upon completion of our performance obligations or expiration of the contractual time to use services such as bulk texting.
Recent Accounting Guidance Adopted
We have implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and applicable to us. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on our financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and we do not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
