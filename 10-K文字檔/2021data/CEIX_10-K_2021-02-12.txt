ITEM 7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Merger with CONSOL Coal Resources LP
On December 30, 2020, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding common units of CONSOL Coal Resources, and CONSOL Coal Resources became our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary (see Note 2 - Major Transactions in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information). In connection with the closing of the CCR Merger, we issued approximately 8.0 million shares of our common stock to acquire the approximately 10.9 million common units of CCR held by third-party CCR investors at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.73 shares of CEIX common stock for each CCR unit, for total implied consideration of $51.7 million.
COVID-19 Update
The Company is monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (“COVID-19”) and has taken, and will continue to take, steps to mitigate the potential risks and impact on the Company and its employees. The health and safety of our employees is paramount. In response to two employees testing positive for COVID-19, the Company temporarily curtailed production at the Bailey Mine for two weeks at the end of March. To date, the Company has experienced a few localized outbreaks, but due to the health and safety procedures put in place by the Company, we have been able to continue operating without production curtailment. The Company continues to monitor the health and safety of its employees closely in order to limit potential risks to our employees, contractors, family members and the community.
We are considered a critical infrastructure company by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. As a result, we were exempt from Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf's executive order, issued in March 2020, closing all businesses that are not life sustaining until Pennsylvania's phased reopening, which began in the second quarter of 2020. The unprecedented decline in coal demand that began in the first quarter hit its lowest point in May 2020, and has improved through the fourth quarter. In response to the decline in demand for our coal as a result of COVID-19, we idled four of our five longwalls for periods of time beginning in the second quarter. As demand improved, we restarted longwalls and ultimately ran four of the five longwalls for the majority of the third quarter and for the entire fourth quarter. This decline in coal demand has negatively impacted our operational, sales and financial performances year-to-date and we expect that this negative impact will continue as the pandemic continues. However, we saw steady improvement in the demand for our coal throughout the third and fourth quarters of 2020.
While some government-imposed shut-downs of non-essential businesses in the United States and abroad have been phased out, there is a possibility that such shut-downs may be reinstated after being lifted as COVID-19 continues to spread rapidly. We expect that depressed domestic and international demand for our coal will continue for so long as there are widespread, government-imposed shut-downs of business activity. Depressed demand for our coal may also result from a general recession or reduction in overall business activity caused by COVID-19. Additionally, some of our customers have already attempted, and may in the future attempt, to invoke force majeure or similar provisions in the contracts they have in place with us in order to avoid taking possession of and paying us for our coal that they are contractually obligated to purchase. Sustained decrease in demand for our coal and the failure of our customers to purchase coal from us that they are obligated to purchase pursuant to existing contracts would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The extent to which COVID-19 may adversely impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including new information concerning the severity of the outbreak, the pace and effectiveness of vaccination efforts and the effectiveness of actions globally to contain or mitigate its effects. We expect this will continue to negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The Company will continue to take steps it believes are appropriate to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on its operations, liquidity and financial condition.

How We Evaluate Our Operations
Our management team uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability. The metrics include: (i) coal production, sales volumes and average revenue per ton; (ii) cost of coal sold, a non-GAAP financial measure; (iii) cash cost of coal sold, a non-GAAP financial measure; (iv) average margin per ton sold, an operating ratio derived from non-GAAP financial measures; and (v) average cash margin per ton sold, an operating ratio derived from non-GAAP financial measures.
Cost of coal sold, cash cost of coal sold, average margin per ton sold and average cash margin per ton sold normalize the volatility contained within comparable GAAP measures by adjusting certain non-operating or non-cash transactions. Each of these non-GAAP metrics are used as supplemental financial measures by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, industry analysts, lenders and ratings agencies, to assess:
•
our operating performance as compared to the operating performance of other companies in the coal industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure;
•
the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow;
•
our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures;
•
the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities; and
•
the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities.
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to total costs, net income, operating cash flow, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures exclude some, but not all, items that affect measures presented in accordance with GAAP, and these measures and the way we calculate them may vary from those of other companies. As a result, the items presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We evaluate our cost of coal sold and cash cost of coal sold on an aggregate basis. We define cost of coal sold as operating and other production costs related to produced tons sold, along with changes in coal inventory, both in volumes and carrying values. The cost of coal sold includes items such as direct operating costs, royalty and production taxes, direct administration costs, and depreciation, depletion and amortization costs on production assets. Our costs exclude any indirect costs, such as selling, general and administrative costs, freight expenses, interest expenses, depreciation, depletion and amortization costs on non-production assets and other costs not directly attributable to the production of coal. The cash cost of coal sold includes cost of coal sold less depreciation, depletion and amortization costs on production assets. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to cost of coal sold and cash cost of coal sold is total costs and expenses.
The following table presents a reconciliation of cost of coal sold and cash cost of coal sold to total costs and expenses, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, on a historical basis, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands).
We define average margin per ton sold as average revenue per ton sold, net of average cost of coal sold per ton. We define average cash margin per ton sold as average revenue per ton sold, net of average cash cost of coal sold per ton. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to average margin per ton sold and average cash margin per ton sold is total coal revenue.
The following table presents a reconciliation of average margin per ton sold and average cash margin per ton sold to total coal revenue, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, on a historical basis, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands, except per ton information).
We define adjusted EBITDA as (i) net income (loss) plus income taxes, net interest expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization, as adjusted for (ii) certain non-cash items, such as long-term incentive awards. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA is net income (loss).
Results of Operations: Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Net (Loss) Income Attributable to CONSOL Energy Inc. Shareholders
CONSOL Energy reported net loss attributable to CONSOL Energy Inc. shareholders of $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net income attributable to CONSOL Energy Inc. shareholders of $76 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
CONSOL Energy consists of the Pennsylvania Mining Complex and the CONSOL Marine Terminal, as well as various corporate and other business activities that are not allocated to the PAMC or the CONSOL Marine Terminal. The other business activities include the development of the Itmann Mine, the Greenfield Reserves, closed and idle mine activities, selling, general and administrative activities, interest expense and income taxes, as well as various other non-operated activities.
PAMC ANALYSIS:
The PAMC division's principal activities consist of mining, preparation and marketing of thermal coal. The division also includes selling, general and administrative costs, as well as various other activities assigned to the PAMC division, but not included in the cost components on a per unit basis.
The PAMC division had earnings before income tax of $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to earnings before income tax of $197 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Variances are discussed below.
Coal Production
The table below presents total tons produced (in thousands) from the Pennsylvania Mining Complex for the periods indicated:
Coal production was 18.8 million tons for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 27.3 million tons for the year ended December 31, 2019. The PAMC division's coal production decreased primarily due to the temporary idling of longwalls at the Bailey and Enlow Fork mines. This was mainly in response to weakened customer demand as a result of a warmer than normal winter, followed by global demand destruction due to the COVID-19 pandemic and, in response, the widespread government-imposed shut-downs, which significantly reduced electricity consumption and, therefore, demand for the Company's coal.
Coal Operations
The PAMC division's coal revenue and cost components on a per unit basis for these periods were as follows:
(1) Average cash cost of coal sold per ton and average cost of coal sold per ton are non-GAAP measures, and average margin per ton sold and average cash margin per ton sold are operating ratios derived from non-GAAP measures. See “How We Evaluate Our Operations - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
Coal Revenue
Coal revenue was $771 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1,289 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Total tons sold decreased in the period-to-period comparison in response to weakened customer demand due to a warmer than normal winter followed by the COVID-19 pandemic, each of which reduced electricity consumption and, therefore, demand for the Company's coal. Additionally, lower natural gas prices as compared to the prior year contributed to electric generation trending toward gas, rather than coal, as a fuel source. The decrease in overall demand, including in both the domestic and export markets the Company serves, resulted in lower pricing received on the Company's sales contracts.
Freight Revenue and Freight Expense
Freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred. This revenue is based on the weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation, primarily rail, used by the customers to which the Company contractually provides transportation services. Freight revenue is completely offset by freight expense. Freight revenue and freight expense were both $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $20 million increase was due to increased shipments to customers where the Company was contractually obligated to provide transportation services.
Miscellaneous Other Income
Miscellaneous other income was $84 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $61 million increase was primarily the result of the sale of certain mining rights and additional customer contract buyouts in the year ended December 31, 2020, offset, in part, by a decrease in sales of externally purchased coal to blend and resell. These partial contract buyouts involved negotiations to reduce coal quantities of several customer contracts in exchange for payment of certain fees to the Company, and do not impact forward contract terms.
Cost of Coal Sold
Cost of coal sold is comprised of operating costs related to produced tons sold, along with changes in both the volumes and carrying values of coal inventory. The costs of coal sold include items such as direct operating costs, royalties and production taxes, direct administration costs and depreciation, depletion, and amortization costs on production assets. Total cost of coal sold was $714 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or $307 million lower than the $1,021 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Average cost of coal sold per ton was $38.24 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $37.37 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in the total cost of coal sold was primarily driven by decreased production activity during the year ended December 31, 2020, mainly in response to weakened market demand, while on a per unit basis, the decreased production resulted in an overall increase in the average cost of coal sold per ton.
Other Costs
Other costs include items that are assigned to the PAMC division but are not included in unit costs, such as idle mine costs, coal reserve holding costs and purchased coal costs. Total other costs increased $40 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to the temporary idling of longwalls at the Bailey and Enlow Fork mines due to the COVID-19 pandemic and, in response, the widespread government-imposed shutdowns, which significantly reduced electricity consumption and industrial activity and, therefore, demand for the Company's coal.
Selling, General and Administrative Costs
The amount of selling, general and administrative costs related to the PAMC division was $53 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $63 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $10 million decrease in the period-to-period comparison was primarily related to several initiatives launched by management to reduce costs, including compensation reductions, curtailment of discretionary expenses and headcount management, partially offset by fees incurred as a result of the CCR Merger.
CONSOL MARINE TERMINAL ANALYSIS:
The CONSOL Marine Terminal division provides coal export terminal services through the Port of Baltimore. The division also includes selling, general and administrative activities and interest expense, as well as various other activities assigned to the CONSOL Marine Terminal division.
The CONSOL Marine Terminal division had earnings before income tax of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to earnings before income tax of $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Overall earnings before income tax were consistent in the period-to-period comparison. The improvement in operating and other costs was the result of cost reduction initiatives implemented at the CONSOL Marine Terminal, and was also directly related to reduced throughput due to weakened export markets and global demand destruction as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and, in response, the widespread government-imposed shut-downs. However, due to the take-or-pay arrangements in both the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the decline in demand was mitigated. This improvement was offset by an increase in selling, general, and administrative costs, which are allocated to the Company's divisions based on a percentage of resources utilized, a percentage of total revenue and a percentage of total projected capital expenditures.
OTHER ANALYSIS:
The other division includes revenue and expenses from various corporate and diversified business activities that are not allocated to the PAMC or the CONSOL Marine Terminal divisions. The diversified business activities include the development of the Itmann Mine, the Greenfield Reserves, closed mine activities, selling, general and administrative activities, interest expense and income taxes, as well as various other non-operated activities.
Other business activities had a loss before income tax of $59 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a loss before income tax of $133 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Variances are discussed below.
Miscellaneous Other Income
Miscellaneous other income was $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $29 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change is due to the following items:
The increase in income resulting from the sale of certain coal lease contracts is attributable to one of several transactions completed in the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the Company's non-operating surface and mineral assets outside of the PAMC. These transactions helped to enhance the Company's liquidity and improve its financial flexibility. See Note 2 - Major Transactions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Royalty income - non-operated coal decreased in the period-to-period comparison due to a decline in the revenues earned as a result of less operating activity by third-party companies mining in reserves to which we have a royalty claim.
Litigation proceeds in the amount of $9 million were received during the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of positive developments in legal matters in which the Company is the plaintiff.
Gain on Sale of Assets
Gain on sale of assets increased $13 million in the period-to-period comparison primarily due to the sale of various gas wells during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Operating and Other Costs
Operating and other costs were $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Operating and other costs decreased in the period-to-period comparison due to the following items:
Employee-Related Legacy Liability Expense decreased $11 million in the period-to-period comparison primarily due to changes in actuarial assumptions made at the beginning of each year. See Note 15 - Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans and Note 16 - Coal Workers' Pneumoconiosis and Workers' Compensation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization
Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $9 million in the period-to-period comparison due to adjustments to the Company's asset retirement obligations based on current projected cash outflows.
Selling, General and Administrative Costs
Selling, general and administrative costs are allocated to the Company's Other division based on a percentage of resources utilized, a percentage of total revenue and a percentage of total projected capital expenditures. The increase of $14 million is primarily a result of fees incurred in connection with the CCR Merger and also a result of increases in the portion of selling, general and administrative expenses allocated to the Other division due to an increase of resources utilized at the Itmann Mine (as a result of its continued development), closed mines and in other business development activities as compared to the prior year.
(Gain) Loss on Debt Extinguishment
Gain on debt extinguishment of $21 million was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the open market repurchases of the Company's 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2025, which traded well below par value.
Loss on debt extinguishment of $24 million was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the open market repurchases of the Company's 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2025, the $110 million required repayment on the Term Loan B Facility, and the refinancing of the Company's Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan A Facility and Term Loan B Facility. See Note 13 - Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Interest Expense, net
Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, is comprised of interest on the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2025 and the 5.75% MEDCO Revenue Bonds. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, decreased $5 million in the period-to-period comparison, primarily related to the $110 million required repayment on the Term Loan B Facility, as well as the refinancing of the Company's Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan A Facility and Term Loan B Facility, both of which occurred during the first quarter of 2019. The decrease is also attributable to repurchases of the Company's 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2025 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, totaling approximately $54 million and $53 million, respectively (see Note 5 - Stock, Unit and Debt Repurchases of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information).
Results of Operations: Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2018
Net Income Attributable to CONSOL Energy Inc. Shareholders
CONSOL Energy reported net income attributable to CONSOL Energy Inc. shareholders of $76 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to net income attributable to CONSOL Energy Inc. shareholders of $153 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
CONSOL Energy consists of the Pennsylvania Mining Complex and the CONSOL Marine Terminal, as well as various corporate and other business activities that are not allocated to the PAMC or the CONSOL Marine Terminal. The other business activities include the Greenfield Reserves, closed and idle mine activities, selling, general and administrative activities, interest expense and income taxes, as well as various other non-operated activities.
PAMC ANALYSIS:
The PAMC division's principal activities consist of mining, preparation and marketing of thermal coal. The division also includes selling, general and administrative costs, as well as various other activities assigned to the PAMC division, but not included in the cost components on a per unit basis.
The PAMC division had earnings before income tax of $197 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to earnings before income tax of $291 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Variances are discussed below.
Coal Production
The table below presents total tons produced (in thousands) from the Pennsylvania Mining Complex for the periods indicated:
Coal production was 27.3 million tons for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 27.6 million tons for the year ended December 31, 2018. The PAMC division's coal production decreased slightly, mainly due to reduced production at the Bailey mine resulting from one additional longwall move and other operational delays. This was partially offset by increased production at the Enlow Fork mine, as geological conditions improved throughout the first half of 2019 compared to the year-ago period. The Harvey mine set an individual production record in 2019, exceeding its previous record set in 2018, and marking its third consecutive record-setting year.
Coal Operations
The PAMC division's coal revenue and cost components on a per unit basis for these periods were as follows:
(1) Average cash cost of coal sold per ton and average cost of coal sold per ton are non-GAAP measures and average margin per ton sold and average cash margin per ton sold are operating ratios derived from non-GAAP measures. See “How We Evaluate Our Operations - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
Coal Revenue
Coal revenue was $1,289 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $1,364 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $75 million decrease was primarily attributable to a $2.11 lower average sales price per ton sold in the 2019 period, mainly driven by lower domestic netback contract pricing compared to the year-ago period, as well as a decrease in tons sold. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in prices the Company received for its export coal.
Freight Revenue and Freight Expense
Freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred. This revenue is based on the weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation, primarily rail, used by the customers to which the Company contractually provides transportation services. Freight revenue is completely offset by freight expense. Freight revenue and freight expense were both $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $44 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $24 million decrease was due to decreased shipments to customers where the Company was contractually obligated to provide transportation services.
Miscellaneous Other Income
Miscellaneous other income was $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $2 million increase was primarily the result of customer contract buyouts totaling $10 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, offset, in part, by a decrease in sales of externally purchased coal to blend and resell.
Cost of Coal Sold
Cost of coal sold is comprised of operating costs related to produced tons sold, along with changes in both the volumes and carrying values of coal inventory. The costs of coal sold include items such as direct operating costs, royalties and production taxes, direct administration costs and depreciation, depletion, and amortization costs on production assets. Total cost of coal sold was $1,021 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, or $40 million higher than the $981 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Total costs per ton sold were $37.37 per ton in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $35.46 per ton in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in the total cost of coal sold was primarily driven by additional equipment rebuilds and longwall overhauls due to the timing of longwall moves and panel development. Also, the Company faced atypical challenges during 2019, including a roof fall and equipment breakdowns. These geological and equipment-related issues resulted in higher mine maintenance and project expenses. Subsidence expense also increased in the year-to-year comparison, primarily due to the timing and nature of the properties undermined.
Other Costs
Other costs include items that are assigned to the PAMC division but are not included in unit costs, such as coal reserve holding costs and purchased coal costs. Total other costs decreased $22 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to additional costs incurred in the year-ago period related to externally purchased coal to blend and resell, discretionary employee benefit expenses and demurrage charges.
Selling, General and Administrative Costs
At December 31, 2019, CONSOL Energy was party to a service agreement with CCR that required CONSOL Energy to provide certain selling, general and administrative services to CCR. These services are paid monthly based on an agreed-upon fixed fee that is reset at least annually. See Note 24 - Related Party Transactions of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. An additional portion of CONSOL Energy's selling, general and administrative costs are allocated to the PAMC division, outside of the service agreement, based on a percentage of total revenue and a percentage of total projected capital expenditures. The amount of selling, general and administrative costs related to the PAMC division was $63 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $3 million increase in the period-to-period comparison was primarily related to accelerated non-cash amortization recorded in the year ended December 31, 2019 for retiree-eligible employees who received awards under the Company's Performance Incentive Plan and an increase in expenditures related to the conversion to and implementation of a different Enterprise Resource and Planning system, partially offset by the reversal of stock-based compensation expense related to forfeitures of awards under the Company's Performance Incentive Plan during the year ended December 31, 2019.
CONSOL MARINE TERMINAL ANALYSIS:
The CONSOL Marine Terminal division provides coal export terminal services through the Port of Baltimore. The division also includes selling, general and administrative activities and interest expense, as well as various other activities assigned to the CONSOL Marine Terminal division.
The CONSOL Marine Terminal division had earnings before income tax of $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to earnings before income tax of $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Overall earnings before income tax were improved in the period-to-period comparison. A take-or-pay agreement was entered into during the year ended December 31, 2018. A full year of revenue was earned under this agreement during the year ended December 31, 2019, which resulted in an improvement in Terminal Revenue in the period-to-period comparison. This was coupled with an improvement in operating and other costs as a result of cost reduction efforts.
OTHER ANALYSIS:
The other division includes revenue and expenses from various corporate and diversified business activities that are not allocated to the PAMC or the CONSOL Marine Terminal divisions. The diversified business activities include the development of the Itmann Mine, the Greenfield Reserves, closed mine activities, selling, general and administrative activities, interest expense and income taxes, as well as various other non-operated activities.
Other business activities had a loss before income tax of $133 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to a loss before income tax of $134 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Variances are discussed below.
Miscellaneous Other Income
Miscellaneous other income was $29 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The change is due to the following items:
Operating and Other Costs
Operating and other costs were $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Operating and other costs decreased in the period-to-period comparison due to the following items:
Employee-Related Legacy Liability Expense decreased $5 million in the period-to-period comparison primarily due to changes in actuarial assumptions made at the beginning of each year. See Note 15 - Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans and Note 16 - Coal Workers' Pneumoconiosis and Workers' Compensation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization
Depreciation, depletion, and amortization decreased $1 million in the period-to-period comparison due to adjustments to the Company's asset retirement obligations during the year ended December 31, 2019 based on current projected cash outflows.
Selling, General and Administrative Costs
Selling, general and administrative costs are allocated to the Company's Other division based on a percentage of total revenue and a percentage of total projected capital expenditures. Selling, general and administrative costs remained materially consistent in the period-to-period comparison.
Loss on Debt Extinguishment
Loss on debt extinguishment of $24 million was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the open market repurchases of the Company's 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2025, the $110 million required repayment on the Term Loan B Facility, and the refinancing of the Company's Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan A Facility and Term Loan B Facility. See Note 13 - Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Loss on debt extinguishment of $4 million was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2018 due to accelerated payments made on the Term Loan A Facility and the open market repurchases of the Company's 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2025.
Interest Expense, net
Interest Expense, net of amounts capitalized, is comprised of interest on the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2025 and the 5.75% MEDCO Revenue Bonds. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, decreased $18 million in the period-to-period comparison, primarily related to the $110 million required repayment on the Term Loan B Facility, as well as the refinancing of the Company's Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan A Facility and Term Loan B Facility, both of which occurred during the first quarter of 2019. The decrease is also attributable to repurchases of the Company's 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes during the year ended December 31, 2019 (see Note 5 - Stock, Unit and Debt Repurchases of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information).
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements and at the date of the financial statements. See Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion. CONSOL Energy bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The Company evaluates its estimates on an on-going basis. Actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters. Management believes that the estimates utilized are reasonable. The following critical accounting policies are materially impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Asset Retirement Obligations
The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act established operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining. CONSOL Energy accrues for the costs of current coal mine disturbance and final coal mine and gas well closure, including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary. Estimates of the Company's total asset retirement obligations, which are based upon permit requirements and CONSOL Energy engineering expertise related to these requirements, including the current portion, were approximately $249 million at December 31, 2020. This liability is reviewed annually, or when events and circumstances indicate an adjustment is necessary, by CONSOL Energy management and engineers. The estimated liability can significantly change if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly.
Accounting for asset retirement obligations requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. For active locations, the present value of the estimated asset retirement obligations is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. For locations that have been fully depleted or closed, the present value of the change is recorded directly to the consolidated statements of income. Asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the reclamation of land upon mine closure, the treatment of mine water discharge where necessary, and the plugging of gas wells acquired for mining purposes. Changes in the assumptions used to calculate the liabilities can have a significant effect on the asset retirement obligations. The amounts of assets and liabilities recorded are dependent upon a number of variables, including the estimated future expenditures, estimated mine lives, assumptions involving inflation rates and the assumed credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate.
Accounting for asset retirement obligations also requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement obligation and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time. The depreciation will generally be determined on a units-of-production basis, whereas the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets.
The Company believes that the accounting estimates related to asset retirement obligations are “critical accounting estimates” because the Company must assess the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligations. In addition, the Company must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Company’s assumptions.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. All available evidence, both positive and negative, must be considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance. At December 31, 2020, CONSOL Energy has deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of approximately $69 million. At December 31, 2020, CONSOL Energy had a valuation allowance of $3 million on deferred tax assets.
CONSOL Energy evaluates all tax positions taken on the state and federal tax filings to determine if the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. For positions that meet the more likely than not to be sustained criteria, an evaluation to determine the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis, that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement is determined. A previously recognized tax position is reversed when it is subsequently determined that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold to be sustained. The evaluation of the sustainability of a tax position and the probable amount that is more likely than not is based on judgment, historical experience and on various other assumptions that CONSOL Energy believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates, that are not readily apparent from other sources, form the basis for recognizing an uncertain tax liability. Actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters.
The Company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are “critical accounting estimates” because the Company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and exercise judgment regarding the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions. When evaluating whether or not a valuation allowance must be established on deferred tax assets, the Company exercises judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of the evidence, a valuation allowance is needed, including carrybacks, tax planning strategies, reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and forecasted future taxable income. In making the determination related to uncertain tax positions, the Company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit. To the extent that an uncertain tax position or valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period, the Company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Company’s assumptions.
Recoverable Coal Reserves
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves, including many factors beyond the Company's control. As a result, estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain. Information about CONSOL Energy's reserves consists of estimates based on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by the Company's staff. CONSOL Energy's coal reserves are periodically reviewed by an independent third party consultant. Some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include:
•
geological conditions;
•
historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas;
•
the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies;
•
assumptions governing future prices; and
•
future operating costs.
Each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties, and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows, may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to the Company's reserves will likely vary from estimates, and these variances may be material. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report for a discussion of the uncertainties in estimating CONSOL Energy's reserves.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
CONSOL Energy's potential sources of liquidity include cash generated from operations, cash on hand, borrowings under the revolving credit facility and securitization facility (which are discussed below), and, if necessary, the ability to issue additional equity or debt securities. The Company believes that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to meet its short-term working capital requirements, long-term capital expenditure requirements, and debt servicing obligations, as well as to provide required letters of credit.
The demand for coal experienced unprecedented decline toward the end of the first quarter of 2020, which continued for much of the year, driven by widespread government-imposed lockdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This decline in coal demand has negatively impacted our operational, sales and financial performances and we expect that this negative impact will continue for at least as long as the pandemic continues. However, we saw steady improvement in the demand for our coal throughout the third and fourth quarters of 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company made repayments of $10 million, $6 million, $9 million and $1 million on its finance leases, Term Loan A Facility, 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes and Term Loan B Facility, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, our total liquidity was $326 million, including $51 million of cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2020, our $400 million revolving credit facility has no borrowings and is currently only used for providing letters of credit with $126 million issued.
While some government-imposed shut-downs of non-essential businesses in the United States and abroad have been phased out, there is a possibility that such shut-downs may be reinstated as COVID-19 continues to spread rapidly. We expect that depressed demand for our coal will continue for so long as there is a widespread, government-imposed shut-down of business activity. Depressed demand for our coal may also result from a general recession or reduction in overall business activity caused by COVID-19. Additionally, some of our customers have already attempted, and may in the future attempt, to invoke force majeure or similar provisions in the contracts they have in place with us in order to avoid taking possession of and paying us for our coal that they are contractually obligated to purchase. Sustained decrease in demand for our coal and the failure of our customers to purchase coal from us that they are obligated to purchase pursuant to existing contracts would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The extent to which COVID-19 may adversely impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including new information concerning the severity of the outbreak and the pace and effectiveness of vaccination efforts or actions globally to contain or mitigate its effects. We expect this matter to negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The Company will continue to take the appropriate steps to mitigate the impact on the Company's operations, liquidity and financial condition.
In March 2020, the President of the United States signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) into law. The CARES Act has various liquidity boosting provisions that affect the Company related to income taxes and employee taxes. The Company has evaluated the various provisions, particularly the increased amount of deductible interest from 30% of adjusted taxable income to 50% for tax years 2019 and 2020. This is expected to reduce the Company's cash tax burden for 2019 and 2020, resulting in additional cash flow from operations. In addition to a decrease in the cash paid for income taxes, the Company has deferred the payment of its portion of Social Security payroll taxes in accordance with the provisions of the CARES Act. Also, for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company is entitled to approximately $3 million in payroll retention credits in accordance with the provisions of the CARES Act. These sources of cash flow will aid in reducing uncertainty over the economic and operational impacts of COVID-19.
The Company expects to maintain adequate liquidity through its operating cash flow and revolving credit facility to fund its working capital and capital expenditures requirements. The Company's cash flow from operations in 2020 was supported by its contracted position and ongoing cost and capital control measures. The Company started experiencing some delays in collections of accounts receivable in the second half of 2019; however, the COVID-related decline in demand has impacted some of our customers, resulting in continued delays in collections and delivering contracted tons. This trend improved during the third and fourth quarters of 2020, although global demand for coal remained challenging. However, if these delays continue or increase, the Company may have less cash flow from operations and may have less borrowing capacity under its securitization facility (under which borrowing capacity is based on certain current accounts receivable).
The Company started a capital construction project on the PAMC coal refuse disposal area in 2017, which is expected to continue through 2021. The Company began construction of the Itmann Mine in the second half of 2019. Given the ongoing uncertainty in the marketplace, COVID-related demand decline and other corporate priorities, the Company chose to slow the spending on construction of the Itmann Mine in 2020.
Uncertainty in the financial markets brings additional potential risks to CONSOL Energy. These risks include a reduction of our ability to raise capital in the equity markets due to declines in the Company's stock price, less availability and higher costs of additional credit, potential counterparty defaults, and commercial bank failures. Financial market disruptions may impact the Company's collection of trade receivables. As a result, CONSOL Energy regularly monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and counterparties and manages credit exposure through payment terms, credit limits, prepayments and security.
Over the past year, the insurance markets have been increasingly challenging, particularly for coal companies. We have experienced rising premiums, reduced coverage and fewer providers willing to underwrite policies and surety bonds. Terms have generally become more unfavorable, including increases in the amount of collateral required to secure surety bonds. Further cost burdens on our ability to maintain adequate insurance and bond coverage may adversely impact our operations, financial position and liquidity.
The Company is continuing to actively monitor the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on its liquidity and capital resources. As disclosed previously and above, we took several steps during 2020 to reinforce our liquidity. From a coal shipment perspective, the decline in coal demand seemed to have hit its lowest point in May 2020, and has since shown some improvement. However, if the demand for our coal continues to decrease, this could adversely affect our liquidity in future quarters. Our Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan A Facility, Term Loan B Facility, Securitization Facility and the Indenture entered into in connection with our 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2025 (collectively, the “Credit Facilities”) contain certain financial covenants. Events resulting from the effects of COVID-19 may negatively impact our liquidity and, as a result, our ability to comply with these covenants, which were amended during the second quarter of 2020. These events could lead us to seek further amendments or waivers from our lenders, limit access to or require accelerated repayment of amounts borrowed under the Credit Facilities, or require us to pursue alternative financing. We have no assurance that any such alternative financing, if required, could be obtained at terms acceptable to us, or at all, as a result of the effects of COVID-19 on capital markets at such time.
Cash Flows (in millions)
Cash provided by operating activities decreased $116 million in the period-to-period comparison, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 on the net income of the Company.
Cash used in investing activities decreased $97 million in the period-to-period comparison. Capital expenditures decreased primarily as a result of cost control measures put into place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the overall decline in coal markets.
Cash used in financing activities decreased $175 million in the period-to-period comparison. During the year ended December 31, 2020, total payments of $80 million were made on the Company's Term Loan A Facility, Term Loan B Facility and 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes. The Company also received proceeds of approximately $19 million related to finance leasing arrangements in the year ended December 31, 2020. In connection with the June 2020 amendment of the Company's credit facility, approximately $8 million of financing-related fees and charges were paid in the year ended December 31, 2020.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, total payments of $188 million were made on the Company's Term Loan B Facility, 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes and the Term Loan A Facility, which included the required excess cash flow repayment of $110 million on the Term Loan B Facility (see Note 13 - Debt for additional information). The Company received additional proceeds on its Term Loan A Facility in the amount of $26 million as a result of the debt refinancing that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2019. In connection with the debt refinancing, approximately $18 million of financing-related fees and charges were paid in the year ended December 31, 2019. Also during the year ended December 31, 2019, CONSOL Energy shares were repurchased and CONSOL Coal Resources LP units were purchased, totaling $33 million.
Senior Secured Credit Facilities
In November 2017, the Company entered into a revolving credit facility with commitments up to $300 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), a Term Loan A Facility of up to $100 million (the “TLA Facility”) and a Term Loan B Facility of up to $400 million (the “TLB Facility”, and together with the Revolving Credit Facility and the TLA Facility, the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”). On March 28, 2019, the Company amended the Senior Secured Credit Facilities to increase the borrowing commitment of the Revolving Credit Facility to $400 million and reallocate the principal amounts outstanding under the TLA Facility and TLB Facility. On June 5, 2020, the Company amended the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (the “amendment”) to provide eight quarters of financial covenant relaxation, effect an increase in the rate at which borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the TLA Facility bear interest, and add an anti-cash hoarding provision. Borrowings under the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities bear interest at a floating rate which can be, at the Company's option, either (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin or (ii) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for the Revolving Credit Facility and TLA Facility depends on the total net leverage ratio, whereas the applicable margin for the TLB Facility is fixed. The amendment increased the applicable margin by 50 basis points on both the Revolving Credit Facility and the TLA Facility. The maturity date of the Revolving Credit and TLA Facilities is March 28, 2023. The TLB Facility's maturity date is September 28, 2024. In June 2019, the TLA Facility began amortizing in equal quarterly installments of (i) 3.75% of the original principal amount thereof, for four consecutive quarterly installments commencing with the quarter ended June 30, 2019, (ii) 6.25% of the original principal amount thereof for the subsequent eight quarterly installments commencing with the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and (iii) 8.75% of the original principal amount thereof for the quarterly installments thereafter, with the remaining balance due at final maturity. In June 2019, the TLB Facility began amortizing in equal quarterly installments in an amount equal to 0.25% per annum of the amended principal amount thereof, with the remaining balance due at final maturity.
Obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are guaranteed by (i) all owners of the PAMC held by the Company, (ii) any other members of the Company’s group that own any portion of the collateral securing the Revolving Credit Facility, and (iii) subject to certain customary exceptions and agreed materiality thresholds, all other existing or future direct or indirect wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries of the Company. The obligations are secured by, subject to certain exceptions (including a limitation of pledges of equity interests in certain subsidiaries and certain thresholds with respect to real property), a first-priority lien on (i) the Company’s interest in the Pennsylvania Mining Complex, (ii) the limited partner units of the Partnership held by the Company, (iii) the equity interests in CONSOL Coal Resources GP LLC held by the Company (iv) the CONSOL Marine Terminal and (v) the 1.5 billion tons of Greenfield Reserves. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain a number of customary affirmative covenants. In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain a number of negative covenants, including (subject to certain exceptions) limitations on (among other things): indebtedness, liens, investments, acquisitions, dispositions, restricted payments, and prepayments of junior indebtedness. The amendment added additional conditions to be met for the covenants relating to investments in joint ventures, general investments, share repurchases, dividends, and repurchases of the Second Lien Notes. The additional conditions require no outstanding borrowings and no more than $200 million of outstanding letters of credit on the Revolving Credit Facility. Further restrictions apply to investments in joint ventures, share repurchases and dividends that require the total net leverage ratio shall not be greater than 2.00 to 1.00.
The Revolving Credit Facility and TLA Facility also include financial covenants, including (i) a maximum first lien gross leverage ratio, (ii) a maximum total net leverage ratio, and (iii) a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The maximum first lien gross leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of Consolidated First Lien Debt to Consolidated EBITDA. Consolidated EBITDA, as used in the covenant calculation, excludes non-cash compensation expenses, non-recurring transaction expenses, extraordinary gains and losses, gains and losses on discontinued operations, non-cash charges related to legacy employee liabilities and gains and losses on debt extinguishment, and subtracts cash payments related to legacy employee liabilities. The maximum total net leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of Consolidated Indebtedness, minus Cash on Hand, to Consolidated EBITDA. The minimum fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Fixed Charges. Consolidated Fixed Charges, as used in the covenant calculation, include cash interest payments, cash payments for income taxes, scheduled debt repayments, dividends paid, and Maintenance Capital Expenditures. The amendment revised the financial covenants applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility and TLA Facility relating to the maximum first lien gross leverage ratio, maximum total net leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, so that for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2020 through March 31, 2021, the maximum first lien gross leverage ratio shall be 2.50 to 1.00, the maximum total net leverage ratio shall be 3.75 to 1.00, and the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio shall be 1.00 to 1.00; for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2021 through September 30, 2021, the maximum first lien gross leverage ratio shall be 2.25 to 1.00 and the maximum total net leverage ratio shall be 3.50 to 1.00; for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2021 through March 31, 2022, the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio shall be 1.05 to 1.00; for the fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2021 through March 31, 2022, the maximum first lien gross leverage ratio shall be 2.00 to 1.00 and the maximum total net leverage ratio shall be 3.25 to 1.00; and for the fiscal quarters ending on or after June 30, 2022, the maximum first lien gross leverage ratio shall be 1.75 to 1.00, the maximum total net leverage ratio shall be 2.75 to 1.00 and the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio shall be 1.10 to 1.00. The maximum first lien gross leverage ratio was 1.64 to 1.00 at December 31, 2020. The maximum total net leverage ratio was 2.54 to 1.00 at December 31, 2020. The minimum fixed charge coverage ratio was 1.56 to 1.00 at December 31, 2020. The Company was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities as of December 31, 2020.
The TLB Facility also includes a financial covenant that requires the Company to repay a certain amount of its borrowings under the TLB Facility within ten business days after the date it files its Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) if the Company has excess cash flow (as defined in the credit agreement for the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) during the year covered by the applicable Form 10-K. During the year ended December 31, 2019, CONSOL Energy made the required repayment of approximately $110 million based on the amount of the Company's excess cash flow as of December 31, 2018. For fiscal year 2018, such repayment was equal to 75% of the Company’s excess cash flow less any voluntary prepayments of its borrowings under the TLB Facility made by the Company during 2018. For all subsequent fiscal years, the required repayment is equal to a certain percentage of the Company’s excess cash flow for such year, ranging from 0% to 75% depending on the Company’s total net leverage ratio, less the amount of certain voluntary prepayments made by the Company, if any, under the TLB Facility during such fiscal year. Based on the Company's excess cash flow calculation, no repayment was required with respect to the year ended December 31, 2019 and approximately $5 million is required with respect to the year ended December 31, 2020.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company entered into interest rate swaps, which effectively converted $150 million of the TLB Facility's floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate for the twelve months ending December 31, 2020 and 2021, and $50 million of the TLB Facility's floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate for the twelve months ending December 31, 2022.
The Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain customary events of default, including with respect to a failure to make payments when due, cross-default and cross-judgment default and certain bankruptcy and insolvency events.
At December 31, 2020, the Revolving Credit Facility had no borrowings outstanding and $126 million of letters of credit outstanding, leaving $274 million of unused capacity. From time to time, CONSOL Energy is required to post financial assurances to satisfy contractual and other requirements generated in the normal course of business. Some of these assurances are posted to comply with federal, state or other government agencies' statutes and regulations. CONSOL Energy sometimes uses letters of credit to satisfy these requirements and these letters of credit reduce the Company's borrowing facility capacity.
Securitization Facility
On November 30, 2017, (1)(i) CONSOL Marine Terminals LLC, as an originator of receivables, (ii) CONSOL Pennsylvania Coal Company LLC (“CONSOL Pennsylvania”), as an originator of receivables and as initial servicer of the receivables for itself and the other originators (collectively, the “Originators”), each a wholly-owned subsidiary of CONSOL Energy, and (iii) CONSOL Funding LLC (the “SPV”), a Delaware special purpose entity and wholly-owned subsidiary of CONSOL Energy, as buyer, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Purchase and Sale Agreement”) and (2)(i) CONSOL Thermal Holdings LLC, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership, as sub-originator (the “Sub-Originator”), and (ii) CONSOL Pennsylvania, as buyer and as initial servicer of the receivables for itself and the Sub-Originator, entered into a Sub-Originator Sale Agreement (the “Sub-Originator PSA”). In addition, on November 30, 2017, the SPV entered into a Receivables Financing Agreement (the “Receivables Financing Agreement”) by and among (i) the SPV, as borrower, (ii) CONSOL Pennsylvania, as initial servicer, (iii) PNC Bank, as administrative agent, LC Bank and lender, and (iv) the additional persons from time to time party thereto as lenders. Together, the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Sub-Originator PSA and the Receivables Financing Agreement establish the primary terms and conditions of an accounts receivable securitization program (the “Securitization”). In March 2020, the securitization facility was amended to, among other things, extend the maturity date from August 30, 2021 to March 27, 2023.
Pursuant to the Securitization, (i) the Sub-Originator sells current and future trade receivables to CONSOL Pennsylvania and (ii) the Originators sell and/or contribute current and future trade receivables (including receivables sold to CONSOL Pennsylvania by the Sub-Originator) to the SPV and the SPV, in turn, pledges its interests in the receivables to PNC Bank, which either makes loans or issues letters of credit on behalf of the SPV. The maximum amount of advances and letters of credit outstanding under the Securitization may not exceed $100 million.
Loans under the Securitization accrue interest at a reserve-adjusted LIBOR market index rate equal to the one-month Eurodollar rate. Loans and letters of credit under the Securitization also accrue a program fee and a letter of credit participation fee, respectively, ranging from 2.00% to 2.50% per annum depending on the total net leverage ratio of CONSOL Energy. In addition, the SPV paid certain structuring fees to PNC Capital Markets LLC and will pay other customary fees to the lenders, including a fee on unused commitments equal to 0.60% per annum.
The SPV’s assets and credit are not available to satisfy the debts and obligations owed to the creditors of CONSOL Energy, the Sub-Originator or any of the Originators. The Sub-Originator, the Originators and CONSOL Pennsylvania as servicer are independently liable for their own customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities. In addition, CONSOL Energy has guaranteed the performance of the obligations of the Sub-Originator, the Originators and CONSOL Pennsylvania as servicer, and will guarantee the obligations of any additional originators or successor servicer that may become party to the Securitization. However, neither CONSOL Energy nor its affiliates will guarantee collectability of receivables or the creditworthiness of obligors thereunder.
The agreements comprising the Securitization contain various customary representations and warranties, covenants and default provisions which provide for the termination and acceleration of the commitments and loans under the Securitization in certain circumstances including, but not limited to, failure to make payments when due, breach of representation, warranty or covenant, certain insolvency events or failure to maintain the security interest in the trade receivables, and defaults under other material indebtedness.
At December 31, 2020, eligible accounts receivable totaled approximately $32 million. At December 31, 2020, the facility had no outstanding borrowings and $31 million of letters of credit outstanding, leaving $1 million of unused capacity. Costs associated with the receivables facility totaled $1,156 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020. These costs have been recorded as financing fees which are included in Operating and Other Costs in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company has not derecognized any receivables due to its continued involvement in the collections efforts.
11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2025
On November 13, 2017, the Company issued $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2025 (the “Second Lien Notes”) pursuant to an indenture (the “Indenture”) dated as of November 13, 2017, by and between the Company and UMB Bank, N.A., a national banking association, as trustee and collateral trustee (the “Trustee”). On November 28, 2017, certain subsidiaries of the Company executed a supplement to the Indenture and became party to the Indenture as a guarantor (the “Guarantors”). The Second Lien Notes are secured by second priority liens on substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors that are pledged and on a first-priority basis as collateral securing the Company’s obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (described above), subject to certain exceptions under the Indenture.
On or after November 15, 2021, the Company may redeem all or part of the Second Lien Notes at the redemption prices set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date (subject to the rights of holders of the Second Lien Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), beginning on November 15 of the years indicated:
At any time or from time to time prior to November 15, 2021, the Company may also redeem all or a part of the Second Lien Notes, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the Applicable Premium, as defined in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date (subject to the rights of holders of the Second Lien Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).
The Indenture contains covenants that will limit the ability of the Company and the Guarantors, to (i) incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock; (ii) create liens to secure indebtedness; (iii) declare or pay dividends on the Company’s common stock, redeem stock or make other distributions to the Company’s stockholders; (iv) make investments; (v) restrict dividends, loans or other asset transfers from the Company’s restricted subsidiaries; (vi) merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of the Company’s assets; (vii) sell or otherwise dispose of certain assets, including equity interests in subsidiaries; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; and (ix) create unrestricted subsidiaries. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. If the Second Lien Notes achieve an investment grade rating from both Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and no default under the Indenture exists, many of the foregoing covenants will terminate and cease to apply. The Indenture also contains customary events of default, including (i) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on the Notes; (ii) default in payment when due of principal or premium, if any, on the Notes at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise; (iii) covenant defaults; (iv) cross-defaults to certain indebtedness, and (v) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company or any of the Guarantors. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Second Lien Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately. If an event of default arises from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with respect to the Company, any restricted subsidiary of the Company that is a significant subsidiary or any group of restricted subsidiaries of the Company that, taken together, would constitute a significant subsidiary, all outstanding Second Lien Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice.
If the Company experiences certain kinds of changes of control, holders of the Second Lien Notes will be entitled to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of that holder’s Second Lien Notes pursuant to an offer on the terms set forth in the Indenture. The Company will offer to make a cash payment equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Second Lien Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Second Lien Notes repurchased to, but not including, the date of purchase, subject to the rights of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.
The Second Lien Notes were issued in a private offering that was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A and to persons outside of the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Stock, Unit and Debt Repurchases
In December 2017, CONSOL Energy’s Board of Directors approved a program to repurchase, from time to time, the Company's outstanding shares of common stock or its 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2025, in an aggregate amount of up to $50 million through the period ending June 30, 2019. The program was subsequently amended by CONSOL Energy's Board of Directors in July 2018 to allow up to $100 million of repurchases of the Company's common stock or its 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2025, subject to certain limitations in the Company's current credit agreement and that certain tax matters agreement entered into by and between the Company and its former parent on November 28, 2017 (the “TMA”). The Company's Board of Directors also authorized the Company to use up to $25 million of the program to purchase CONSOL Coal Resources LP's outstanding common units in the open market. In May 2019, CONSOL Energy's Board of Directors approved an expansion of the program in the amount of $75 million, bringing the aggregate limit of the program to $175 million. The May 2019 expansion also increased the aggregate limit of the amount of CONSOL Coal Resources LP's common units that can be purchased under the program to $50 million, which is consistent with the Company's credit facility covenants that prohibit the Company from using more than $50 million for the purchase of CONSOL Coal Resources LP's outstanding common units. The Company's Board of Directors also approved extending the termination date of the program from June 30, 2019 to June 30, 2020. In July 2019, CONSOL Energy's Board of Directors approved an expansion of the program in the amount of $25 million, bringing the aggregate limit of the program to $200 million. On May 8, 2020, CONSOL Energy's Board of Directors approved an expansion of the stock, unit and debt repurchase program. The aggregate amount of the program's expansion was $70 million, bringing the total amount of the Company's stock, unit and debt repurchase program to $270 million. The Company's Board of Directors also approved extending the termination date of the program from June 30, 2020 to June 30, 2022.
Under the terms of the program, CONSOL Energy is permitted to make repurchases in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, accelerated repurchase programs or in structured share repurchase programs. CONSOL Energy is also authorized to enter into one or more 10b5-1 plans with respect to any of the repurchases. Any repurchases of common stock, notes or units are to be funded from available cash on hand or short-term borrowings. The program does not obligate CONSOL Energy to acquire any particular amount of its common stock, notes or units, and can be modified or suspended at any time at the Company’s discretion. The program is conducted in compliance with applicable legal requirements and within the limits imposed by any credit agreement, receivables purchase agreement, indenture or the TMA and is subject to market conditions and other factors.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company spent approximately $32 million to retire $54 million of its 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2025, which continued to trade well below par value. No common shares were repurchased and no common Partnership units were purchased under this program during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Total Equity and Dividends
Total equity attributable to CONSOL Energy was $554 million at December 31, 2020 and $572 million at December 31, 2019. See the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details.
On December 30, 2020, the Merger of CCR was completed (see Note 2 - Major Transactions). CONSOL Energy accounted for the change in its ownership interest in CCR as an equity transaction, which was reflected as a reduction of noncontrolling interest with corresponding increases to common stock and capital in excess of par value.
The declaration and payment of dividends by CONSOL Energy is subject to the discretion of CONSOL Energy's Board of Directors, and no assurance can be given that CONSOL Energy will pay dividends in the future. The determination to pay dividends in the future will depend upon, among other things, general business conditions, CONSOL Energy's financial results, contractual and legal restrictions regarding the payment of dividends by CONSOL Energy, planned investments by CONSOL Energy and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. The Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities limit CONSOL Energy's ability to pay dividends up to $25 million annually, which increases to $50 million annually when the Company's total net leverage ratio is less than 1.50 to 1.00 and subject to an aggregate amount up to a cumulative credit calculation set forth in the facilities, with additional conditions of no outstanding borrowings and no more than $200 million of outstanding letters of credit on the Revolving Credit Facility, and the total net leverage ratio shall not be greater than 2.00 to 1.00. The total net leverage ratio was 2.54 to 1.00 and the cumulative credit was approximately $16 million at December 31, 2020. The cumulative credit starts with $50 million and builds with excess cash flow commencing in 2018. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities do not permit dividend payments in the event of default. The Indenture to the 11.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes limits dividends when the Company's total net leverage ratio exceeds 2.00 to 1.00 and subject to an amount not to exceed an annual rate of 4.0% of the quoted public market value per share of such common stock at the time of the declaration. The Indenture does not permit dividend payments in the event of default.
Off-Balance Sheet Transactions
CONSOL Energy does not maintain off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on CONSOL Energy’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources which are not disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. CONSOL Energy participates in the United Mine Workers of America (the “UMWA”) Combined Benefit Fund and the UMWA 1992 Benefit Plan which generally accepted accounting principles recognize on a pay-as-you-go basis. These benefit arrangements may result in additional liabilities that are not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020. The various multi-employer benefit plans are discussed in Note 17-Other Employee Benefit Plans in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. CONSOL Energy's total contributions under the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 were $5,383, $6,042 and $6,829 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Based on available information at December 31, 2020, CONSOL Energy's obligation for the UMWA Combined Benefit Fund and 1992 Benefit Plan is estimated to be approximately $56,039. CONSOL Energy also uses a combination of surety bonds, corporate guarantees and letters of credit to secure its financial obligations for employee-related, environmental, performance and various other items which are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020. Management believes these items will expire without being funded. See Note 22-Commitments and Contingent Liabilities in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details of the various financial guarantees that have been issued by CONSOL Energy.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In January 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2021-01 - Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) to clarify that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. Specifically, certain provisions in Topic 848, if elected by an entity, apply to derivative instruments that use an interest rate for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment that is modified as a result of reference rate reform. Amendments in this Update to the expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 capture the incremental consequences of the scope clarification and tailor the existing guidance to derivative instruments affected by the discounting transition. Management has elected to apply this Update subsequent to March 12, 2020. Management is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, but does not expect this update to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04 - Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) - Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The amendments in this Update provide optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. In response to concerns about structural risks of interbank offered rates (IBORs), and, particularly, the risk of cessation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), regulators in several jurisdictions around the world have undertaken reference rate reform initiatives to identify alternative reference rates that are more observable or transaction based and less susceptible to manipulation. This Update also provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments in this Update apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. An entity may elect to apply the amendments for contract modifications by Topic or Industry Subtopic as of any date from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020, or prospectively from a date within an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020, up to the date that the financial statements are available to be issued. Once elected for a Topic or an Industry Subtopic, the amendments in this Update must be applied prospectively for all eligible contract modifications for that Topic or Industry Subtopic. Management has elected to apply this Update subsequent to March 12, 2020. Management is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, but does not expect this update to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.
In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01 - Investments - Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). The amendments in this Update clarify certain interactions between the guidance to account for certain equity securities under Topic 321, the guidance to account for investments under the equity method of accounting in Topic 323, and the guidance in Topic 815, which could change how an entity accounts for an equity security under the measurement alternative or a forward contract or purchased option to purchase securities that, upon settlement of the forward contract or exercise of the purchased option, would be accounted for under the equity method of accounting or the fair value option in accordance with Topic 825, Financial Instruments. These amendments improve current GAAP by reducing diversity in practice and increasing comparability of the accounting for these interactions. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Management does not expect this update to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12 - Income Taxes (Topic 740) to reduce the complexity of accounting for income taxes while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. The amendments in Update 2019-12 will remove the following exceptions: (1) the exception to the incremental approach for intra-period tax allocation; (2) exceptions to accounting for basis differences when there are ownership changes in foreign investments; and (3) the exception to the general methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. The amendments in Update 2019-12 will also simplify the accounting for income taxes in the areas of franchise tax, step up in the tax basis of goodwill associated with a business combination, allocation of current and deferred tax expense to a legal entity that is not subject to tax in its separate financial statements, and presentation of the effect of an enacted change in tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date. The Update adds minor codification improvements for income taxes related to employee stock ownership plans and investments in qualified affordable housing projects accounted for using the equity method. These changes will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Management does not expect this update to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14 - Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Subtopic 715-20) to improve the effectiveness of disclosures in the notes to the financial statements by facilitating clear communication of the information required by GAAP. The amendments modify the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. These changes will be effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this guidance in 2020, and there was no material impact on the Company's financial statements.
