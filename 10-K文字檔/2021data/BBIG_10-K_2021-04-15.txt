Edison Nation Medical Operations
Edison Nation Holdings, LLC formed Edison Nation Medical (“EN Medical”) in May of 2012 as a partnership with Carolinas Healthcare Systems (now called Atrium). Atrium is the 2nd largest healthcare system in the US. Carolina Health (Atrium) looked to identify a way to aggregate and commercialize the healthcare related innovations that were coming from their physicians, nurses, and patients, and Edison Nation offered a platform to provide that function.
EN Medical built out a separate platform, leveraging the Edison Nation model to look for ideas that improved patient care and lowered costs. EN collected some great ideas, but the market shifted and EN found that the licensing model was very difficult as big medical device companies wanted to acquire companies with sales versus just buying IP and prototypes.
Today, EN Medical operates an online portal granting hospitals, government agencies and distributors access to its catalog of medical supplies and hand sanitizers.
Non-Employee Director Compensation
On September 26, 2018, the Compensation Committee of the board of directors approved the terms of compensation to be paid to non-employee directors.

Accordingly, on November 15, 2019, in lieu of granting the Options, the Company granted the board of directors restricted stock units of 20,000 shares which vested immediately. In addition, on November 15, 2019, the Company granted each non-employee director restricted stock units of 30,000 shares, which vested on January 1, 2020. Current compensation for non-employee directors includes an annual retainer of $20,000, and an award of restricted stock units of 30,000 shares.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods. The accounting estimates that require our most significant, difficult and subjective judgments have an impact on revenue recognition, the determination of share-based compensation and financial instruments. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2020 versus Year Ended December 31, 2019
The following table sets forth information comparing the components of net loss for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Revenue
For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenues increased by $3,257,887 or 26.01%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in the sale of personal protective equipment due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Corrugated through our Ferguson Containers, Inc.
Cost of Revenues
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cost of revenues increased by $3,879,805 or 51.57%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in the sale of personal protective equipment in total consolidated revenues.
Gross Profit
For the year ended December 31, 2020, gross profit decreased by $612,918, or 12.28%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to the lower margin products during 2020 related to the sale of personal protective equipment. The Company’s higher margin branded business was down during the year due to the impacts of COVID-19.
Operating Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $12,280,192 and $14,085,195 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing a decrease of $1,805,003, or 12.81%. The decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in workforce and reduced spending due to cost controlling measures implemented in 2020. Decreases included payroll and related costs of $692,443, travel of $295,122, freight and postage of 131,152 and professional fees of $2,199,605. The reduction in expenses was offset by increases in stock-based compensation expense of $966,848, bad debts of $123,385 and selling expenses of $384,039.
Impairment
For the year ended December 31, 2019, impairment charges of $4,443,000 relate to an impairment charge related to our annual impairment assessment of our brands business which is the only reporting unit with Goodwill. The amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset’s fair value. There were no impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2020 related our brands business.
Gain on Change in Fair Value of Earnout
For the year ended December 31, 2019, a gain of $520,000 was recognized related to a change in fair value of the earnout liability. The decrease in the earnout is due to decreased actual revenues as compared to anticipated revenues at the time of acquisition of the Cloud B business in 2019 and going forward. The impairment above was attributable to the lower than anticipated revenues going forward.
Rental Income
Rental income was $102,815 for both the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Interest expense
Interest expense was $3,378,131 for the year ended December 31, 2020 versus $1,299,153 in the previous year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in interest expense was related to increased borrowings of debt during 2020.
Income tax expense
Income tax expense was $19,197 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $41,552 or 185.72%, compared to a benefit of $22,373 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase from an income tax benefit to income tax expense is due to current year state income taxes in 2020 versus current year state income taxes in 2019 offset by a refund for required payments for estimated foreign income taxes.
Income (Loss) from discontinued operations
Income (loss) from discontinued operations represents the operations of divestiture of SRM Entertainment Limited. The Company made the decision to divest the amusement park business due to the slow re-openings of amusement parks around the world and the investment that would have been needed to remain open and the even greater investment to relaunch the business as the amusement parks begin to get back to full capacity. Income (Loss) from discontinued operations increased to a $0.6 million loss in Fiscal 2020, compared to a loss of $0.008 million in Fiscal 2019.
Gain on Divestiture from discontinued operations
Gain from divestiture of the discontinued operations represents the gain recognized on the sale of SRM Entertainment Limited, which consisted of 200,000 shares of common stock of a NASDAQ listed company and the net liabilities disposed of due to the sale.
Non-GAAP Measures
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
The Company defines EBITDA as net loss before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain non-recurring items and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of our ongoing operating performance from period to period. These items will include stock-based compensation, restructuring and severance costs, transaction costs, acquisition costs, certain other non-recurring charges and gains that the Company does not believe reflects the underlying business performance.
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA consisted of the following:
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Management believes that because Adjusted EBITDA excludes (a) certain non-cash expenses (such as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation) and (b) expenses that are not reflective of the Company’s core operating results over time (such as restructuring costs, litigation or dispute settlement charges or gains, and transaction-related costs), this measure provides investors with additional useful information to measure the Company’s financial performance, particularly with respect to changes in performance from period to period. The Company’s management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (a) as a measure of operating performance, (b) for planning and forecasting in future periods, and (c) in communications with the Company’s board of directors concerning the Company’s financial performance. The Company’s presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation and should not be used by investors as a substitute or alternative to net income or any measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Instead, management believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should be used to supplement the Company’s financial measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP to provide a more complete understanding of the trends affecting the business.
Although Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for, or more meaningful than, amounts determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Some of the limitations to using non-GAAP measures as an analytical tool are (a) they do not reflect the Company’s interest income and expense, or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Company’s debt, (b) they do not reflect future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, and (c) although depreciation and amortization charges are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and non-GAAP measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our operations lost $7,902,347 of which $4,623,130 was non-cash and $1,131,975 related to restructuring, severance, transaction costs and non-recurring items.
At December 31, 2020, we had total current assets of $5,342,183 and current liabilities of $11,285,663 resulting in negative working capital of $5,943,480. At December 31, 2020, we had total assets of $28,028,207 and total liabilities of $14,505,506 resulting in stockholders’ equity of $13,522,701.
The foregoing factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to attract significant new sources of capital, attain a reasonable threshold of operating efficiencies and achieve profitable operations from the sale of its products.
Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company mitigated any substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern through the raise of additional funds of $25,300,000 through 3 separate private placements. The following are the amounts raised under each private placement:
● In January 2021, the Company completed closing of a debt private placement offering of $12,000,000, receiving net proceeds of $10,770,000.
● In January 2021, the Company completed closing of a equity private placement offering of $3,300,000, receiving net proceeds of $3,255,000.
● In February 2021, the Company completed the closing of a debt private placement offering of $10,000,000, receiving net proceeds of $8,950,000.
In addition, management has considered possible mitigating factors within our management plan on our ability to continue for at least a year from the date these financial statements are filed. The following items are management plans to alleviate any going concern issues:
● Raise further capital through the sale of additional equity or the exercise of outstanding warrants.
● Borrow money under debt securities.
● The deferral of payments to related party debt holders for both principal and related interest expense.
● Further reduction of headcount.
● Possible sale of certain brands to other manufacturers.
● Entry into other business opportunities.
Our operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business, including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including our ability to successfully commercialize our products and services, competing technological and market developments, and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings.
At December 31, 2020, we had a cash and cash equivalents balance of $249,356. The Company believes through the subsequent capital raise that the funds available to it are adequate to meet its working capital needs, debt service and capital requirements for the next 12 months from the date of this filing.
