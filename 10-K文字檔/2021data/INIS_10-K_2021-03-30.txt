Overview
International Isotopes Inc. (the “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our”) produces an FDA approved generic sodium iodide I-131 drug product, manufactures a wide range of nuclear medicine calibration and reference standards and provides radiochemicals for clinical research and life sciences. The Company also produces a variety of cobalt-60 products, and provides contract manufacturing services of radiopharmaceutical and radiochemical products for clients. A more detailed description of each of these product lines and services along with a description of our business segments can be found in Item 1, “Business” within this Annual Report.
During 2020, we focused our efforts on achieving profitability in each of our core business segments and reached several significant goals. During 2020, we:
 Received approval by the FDA of our abbreviated new drug application (ANDA). FDA approval of our ANDA was received in February 2020;
 Increased sales in the Radiochemical segment by 43% primarily as of result of an increase in sales of our new generic sodium iodide I-131 drug product which was launched in March 2020.
 Increased overall gross profit percentage by approximately 6%;
 Completed an six-thousand square foot expansion of our facility and installed equipment capable of supporting future production or contract manufacturing of products in a fully cGMP compliant facility.
 Expanded sales of our nuclear medicine products through exercising our management opportunity with RadQual, LLC (RadQual). In particular, increased our international sales by utilizing the marketing and distribution expertise of our joint venture with RadQual, TI Services, LLC (TI Services); and
 Maintained our relationships in Lea County, New Mexico (location of our proposed de-conversion facility) and continued to pursue opportunities to obtain additional contracts for depleted uranium de-conversion services related to our proposed de-conversion project.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a reduction of sales within our nuclear medicine calibration standards segment and radiochemicals segment during the year ended December 31, 2020. There was no discernable impact from COVID-19 to our cobalt products business segment during the period. Revenue from nuclear medicine products for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased approximately 6% compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease in sales for the year ended December 31, 2020, for our nuclear medicine calibration standards segment was the result of the temporary closure of many imaging clinics and suspension of elective or non-essential imaging procedures. The sale of radiochemical products increased during the year, however, we believe the increase in revenue would have been greater were it not for the negative impact of COVID-19.
To-date we have not furloughed or terminated any employees as a result of the financial impact of COVID-19. The Company has only seen a limited impact in our raw material supply chain related to the COVID-19, primarily some plastics which have been in strong demand for certain types of PPE. Alternative sources of raw materials have been obtained without any interruption to production. With the heightened concern about corporate liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company believes that it has adequate cash to support continuing operations.
Business Strategy and Core Philosophies
Broadly defined, our business strategy is to continue to build our reputation as a leader in the cobalt, radiochemical, and nuclear medicine product industries, and to maximizing the revenue potential of our new generic sodium iodine I-131 product and our expanded contract manufacturing capabilities. We also intend to continually seek ways to improve our customer service and expand our market share, with the ultimate goal of providing greater return to our shareholders. Specifically, we are continuously working with our customers to improve and develop new products to better serve the needs of the end user which, ultimately, we believe will boost product sales. A key part of our short-term and long-term business strategy is to develop and market additional generic drug products, similar to our sodium iodide I-131 product, that will offer customers a high quality, reliable, and affordable products as well as increase our revenues. In addition, we will pursue financial support that will be structured in such a way to support further expansion of our products and services to exploit similar market opportunities.
Our core philosophy is to strive to provide high quality products and services as a profitable and environmentally conscious business, while offering excellent customer service and providing a safe and productive working environment for our employees. We operate in accordance with an ISO Quality Management System and in accordance with all current Good Manufacturing Practices under which we seek to maintain the highest level of quality and continuously improve our product manufacturing processes.

Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
The following table presents comparative revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Revenues
Total revenues in 2020 were $9,364,866, compared to $8,955,204 in 2019, which represents an increase of $409,692, or approximately 5%. The performance of each segment is discussed in the following paragraphs.
Radiochemical Products
Sales of radiochemical products accounted for approximately 44% of our total sales revenue in 2020 and approximately 32% of total sales revenue in 2019. Sales in this segment increased by $1,219,363, or approximately 43% to $4,071,571 as compared to $2,852,207 in 2019. The increase is a result of a $1,887,488 or 93% increase in radiochemical product sales year over year that was primarily the result of sales of our new generic sodium iodide I-131 drug product which was launched in March 2020. We expect sales of our new product to continue to trend upward. This increase in sales was partially offset by a reduction in payments received for contract manufacturing services year over year.
In February 2020, we received approval of an ANDA to the FDA for a sodium iodide radiopharmaceutical product for use in treatment of hyperthyroidism and carcinoma of the thyroid. We began sales of this product in March 2020, and these sales have had a significant positive impact on our revenues for 2020. We expect continued growth in sales for this product in 2021 and beyond. This is the first of several potential generic drug products we plan to submit to the FDA in the coming years. Within this segment, we currently distribute sodium iodide (I-131) as a radiochemical product. This product is being used for a variety of applications including use in investigational and clinical trials for the treatment of breast, lung, prostate, and ovarian cancers. We believe that the product enhancements we have made, in addition to the generic drug products we plan to submit to the FDA, should increase future sales in this business segment.
Additionally, we provide contract manufacturing of radiochemical products for our customers. In 2019, we entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with Progenics and completed an expansion of our existing facility to support that and other contract manufacturing activities. During 2020, Progenics was acquired by another company and, as a result, revised their contract manufacturing needs. Progenics requested to terminate the contract manufacturing agreement and in we entered into a settlement agreement with Progenics in December 2020. In December 2020, we entered into an agreement with Progenics to which, among other things, the manufacturing agreement was terminated effective immediately. As part of the agreement, we received a termination payment consisting of cash and Progenics’s relinquishment on all claims to expansion of our facility and all the equipment purchased by Progenics in connection with the Manufacturing Agreement with the exception of certain specified equipment. The settlement resulted in a significant one-time gain in 2020 as detailed under Other Income (Expense) below. We are currently developing a business plan to produce additional radiopharmaceutical products or explore new contract manufacturing opportunities in this facility using this equipment.
Cobalt Products
Cobalt products sales accounted for approximately 13% of our total sales revenue in 2020 and approximately 9% in 2019. Sales in this segment increased by $379,177, or approximately 45%, in 2020 to $1,225,580, as compared to $846,404 in 2019. The increase in revenue within this segment is the result of increase Cobalt Sealed Source Manufacturing partially due to receipt of material from the ATR in March 2020. Our sealed source manufacturing generates the majority of our revenue within this segment and sealed source sales depend on our ability to produce or procure this cobalt material.
In October 2014, we entered into a ten-year agreement with the DOE for the irradiation of cobalt targets. It takes many years to irradiate these cobalt targets to the desired level of activity and we anticipated having high specific activity cobalt available for our customers in 2020. However, the material had lower than expected activity and further receipt of material has been delayed until about June 2021. Periodically we have been able to acquire recycled material that can be used to manufacture sealed sources for customers, and in some instances, our customers have supplied their own cobalt material for source fabrication.
We have entered into cobalt supply agreements with several customers. Pursuant to these contracts, we will supply bulk cobalt-60 and, in some cases, provide source manufacturing and installation services for the customer. The terms of these cobalt contracts require some advance progress payments from each customer. The funding received under these contracts has been recorded as unearned revenue under short- and long-term liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We recognized some of this revenue in 2019 and 2018 when we fulfilled contract performance objectives by supplying sealed sources manufactured with cobalt from our alternate supplier.
As of December 2020, we continued to hold in inventory many old design cobalt targets at the ATR that had undergone some irradiation. In 2020, we performed year-end analytical review of these targets and no longer believe these older design targets to be economically viable. Accordingly, we have written off the entire carrying value from our inventory of these older design targets. We will periodically continue to review any residual value of this cobalt material for any future potential economic opportunity
Nuclear Medicine Standards
Sales of nuclear medicine standards accounted for approximately 39% and 44%, of our total sales revenue in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Sales in this segment decreased by $252,047, or approximately 6%, to $3,673,256 in 2020, as compared to $3,925,303 in 2019. This decrease in sales is due partially to the result of the temporary closure of many imaging clinics and suspension of elective or non-essential imaging procedures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic caused some interruption to distribution of our products due to temporary worldwide shipping restrictions.
In 2017, affiliates of the Company purchased 75.5% of the member units of RadQual and at that time, we were named as one of the managing members of RadQual. Because of this change in member ownership and management, we have consolidated RadQual’s operations within the nuclear medicine segment for financial reporting. For purposes of consolidation, all significant intercompany activity has been eliminated in the reporting process.
We formed a 50/50 joint venture, TI Services, with RadQual in 2010, to distribute products and promote services for nuclear medicine, nuclear cardiology and PET imaging. Again, due to our affiliate members and management, we have also consolidated TI Services into our financial statements and have eliminated all intercompany transactions.
We anticipate that our sales of RadQual products will remain strong and that our management of RadQual will create significant future opportunities through new product development. Additionally, we will continue to work closely with TI Services using their expertise in marketing and distribution strategies to strengthen nuclear medicine product sales through TI Services.
Radiological Services
Revenues from our Radiological Services segment accounted for approximately 2% of our total sales revenue in 2020 and approximately 13% in 2019. Sales in this segment decreased by $954,651, or approximately 82%, from $1,170,790 in 2019, to $216,139 in 2020. The decrease in revenue is attributable to our termination of radiological field service contract work for the DOE and termination of our contract for gemstone processing.
Revenue from field service work for the DOE had accounted for the majority of revenue in this segment. Radiological Field Services accounted for 0% of the Radiological Services segment sales in 2020 and approximately 67% in 2019. Revenue from radiological field services was $0 for the year ended December 31, 2020, and $787,940 for the same period in 2019. This decrease of $787,940 was the result of our termination of all radiological field service contract work, and removal of this activity from our NRC license following the May 2019 contamination event discussed below.
On May 2, 2019, our radiological services team was involved in a contamination event involving a breached cesium-137 source at an off-site location in the state of Washington. This work was being performed under a contract with the DOE. We have reviewed the results of the DOE investigation into this event and have implemented appropriate corrective actions. On January 5, 2021, we were notified by the DOE that we had been indemnified from any financial liability for this event under the Price Anderson Act (PAA).
The Washington Department of Health (DOH) issued a Notice of Violation to us in May 2020 citing two violations of our reciprocity license in the State of Washington related to the contamination event. On December 22, 2020, the Washington DOH imposed a civil penalty of $11,000 related to the contamination event. The Washington DOH investigation has now been closed.
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) completed an inspection of our radiological safety program and issued a Notice of Violation in June 2020 citing two different violations of our NRC materials license also related to the contamination event. The NRC notified us on October 20, 2020 that it had determined the violations were considered a Severity Level II problem. In accordance with their enforcement discretion authority the NRC has decided not to impose any civil penalty against us for these violations in recognition of our significant corrective actions. Our corrective actions included termination of all field service activities and removal of these activities from our NRC license. The NRC investigation and our actions necessary to address the NOV are now closed.
Revenue from gemstone processing for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $172,555 compared to $382,850 for the same period in 2019. This was a decrease of $210,295, or approximately 55%. This decrease in revenue from gemstone processing is the result of termination of our gemstone processing activities as described below.
In January 2020, we notified our gemstone processing customer that the service contract with them was being terminated because the volume of gemstones sent for processing did not meet contract minimums. The termination activities and wrap up of this service will continue through the remainder of 2021 and the Company will see a steady decline in revenue from this service as production is wrapped up. We plan to convert the spaces in the facility that had been used to perform this contract work into expanded Nuclear Medicine new product manufacturing. The loss in revenue expected from termination of the gemstone processing agreement is expected to be more than compensated for by the expansion of new nuclear medicine source products.
Fluorine Products
In 2020, we had revenues related to Fluorine Products of $178,350 as compared to $160,500 in 2019. These revenues were related to an agreement to provide engineering and technical assistance services related to our fluorine products intellectual property. We expect additional revenue amounts in 2021 as this agreement continues. We developed our fluorine products in conjunction with the uranium de-conversion project, in order to take advantage of the anticipated need for depleted uranium de-conversion services. We established the Fluorine Products segment in 2004 to support production and sale of the gases produced using our FEP. In 2013, we made the decision to place continued formal design work on the proposed de-conversion facility on hold until such time that we are able to secure additional de-conversion services contracts. Until such time that work resumes on the project, we will limit our expenditures to essential items such as maintenance of the NRC license, land use agreements, communication with our prospective FEP product customers, and interface with the State of New Mexico and Lea County officials.
During 2020, we incurred $142,896 of planning and other expenses related to the de-conversion project, as compared to $151,035 in 2019. This is a decrease of $8,139, or approximately 5%, and is the result of decreased licenses and permit expense allocated to this project in 2020. We expect that our costs in the future will be limited to essential items such as continued interactions with our customers, the state of New Mexico, and Lea County, New Mexico.
Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit
Cost of revenues for 2020 was $3,904,869 as compared to $4,289,490 in 2019, a decrease of $384,621, or approximately 9%. Gross profit percentage increased to 58% for 2020, from 52% in 2019. The following table presents revenues and cost of revenues information:
During 2020, we continued to monitor and control direct costs. Raw materials used in our radiochemical products and nuclear medicine standards represented the bulk of direct costs for 2020. In each of these business segments, we have purchase agreements in place with suppliers to obtain optimum pricing. Periodically, the cost increases for these raw materials or we may also use alternate supply sources for our material which might not carry pricing as favorable as our contracted suppliers.
In 2020, we were able increase gross profit percentage in our radiochemical segment with sales of our new generic sodium iodide I-131 drug product. Throughout 2020, in our nuclear medicine product segment, we maintained a low cost of scrapped material as a result of adjustments made in the manufacturing processes in this segment. With the exception of the cost of cobalt material, we are not aware of any significant future price increases that may potentially affect our cost of revenues.
Operating Costs and Expenses
Total operating costs and expenses for 2020 were $5,875,700, as compared to $5,224,011 in 2019. This is an increase of $651,689, or approximately 12%.
The following table presents operating costs and expenses for 2019 as compared to 2018:
Salaries and contract labor expense increased by $267,449, or approximately 10%, which was the result of the addition of new personnel and annual salary and wage increases and periodic performance awards made during the year. In addition, non-cash equity compensation expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $88,180 as compared to $129,850 for the same period in 2019. This is a decrease of $41,670, or approximately 32%, and is the result of equity compensation recorded for outstanding stock options granted to employees and non-employees.
General administrative and consulting expenses increased to $2,828,460 in 2020, as compared to $2,400,343 in 2019, an increase of $428,117, or approximately 18%. This increase is a result of increased rent expense related to the expansion of our existing facility, increased professional services expense, and increased insurance expense.
Research and development expense was $219,498 for 2020, compared to $263,375 for 2019. This is a decrease of $43,877, or approximately 17%. The majority of this decrease in research and development expense was the result of decreased costs associated with our ANDA submission to the FDA for our new drug product in our Radiochemical Products segment. During both 2020 and 2019, we limited further investment in the planned de-conversion facility and limited further spending on the project only for expenses necessary to maintain licensing and continued interactions with New Mexico and Lea County. We will continue to delay further engineering work on the de-conversion project until we are able to secure additional contracts for de-conversion services.
Other Income (Expense)
The following table presents other income (expense) for 2019 as compared to 2018:
Other income was $3,637,026 for 2020 as compared to other expense of ($114,509) for 2019. This is an increased income of $3,751,535. The increase is due to income recognized as part of our termination of our manufacturing and supply agreement with Progenics. As part of the termination agreement, we received $500,000 cash of which $128,125 was for payment of outstanding invoices. The remaining $371,875 was recorded as “other income”. Additionally, we received title of improvements and equipment that was installed in our facility. These improvements and equipment are valued at approximately $2,500,000; this was also recorded as “other income. Additionally we had income from PPP SBA Loans converted to grant income of $546,100 which was recorded as “other income”. In 2019 we had income and expenses related to the costs resulting from the contamination event that occurred at an offsite location in the state of Washington in May 2019. During 2019, net expense for this cleanup was $206,454. On January 5, 2021, we were notified by the DOE that we had been indemnified from any financial liability for this event under the Price Anderson Act (PAA).
Interest income in 2020 was $3,192 as compared to $13,090 in 2019. This decrease of $9,898 was due to decreased interest rates earned cash balances held at banks and other institutions in interest-bearing accounts.
Interest expense increased during 2020, to $781,837, from $541,274 in 2019. This is an increase of $240,563, or approximately 44%. This increased interest expense was due to an increase in non-cash interest expense for issuance of warrants related to notes payable and preferred stock issuances. In 2020, this non-cash interest expense was $390,938 as compared to $155,157 in 2019. This is an increase of $235,781. Interest expense includes dividends accrued on our Series C Preferred Stock (as defined below) issued in 2017. In 2020, we recorded interest expense of $252,780 for dividends payable on our Series C Preferred Stock.
In connection with the 2013 Promissory Note (as defined below), we recorded $30,000 of interest expense for each of 2020 and 2019, and approximately $13,000 and $27,000 of non-cash interest expense related to a debt discount feature on the 2013 Promissory Note for 2020 and 2019 respectively.
In connection with the 2019 Promissory Note (as defined below), we recorded $39,000 and $500 of interest expense for 2020 and 2019 respectively, and approximately $249,000 of non-cash interest expense related to a debt discount feature and issuance of warrants related to the 2019 Promissory Note for 2020 with no such expense in 2019.
In connection with our 2017 issuance of Series C Preferred Stock, we issued Class M Warrants and Class N Warrants. We recorded approximately $128,000 of non-cash interest expense for each of 2020 and 2019 in relation to these warrants.
Net Income or Loss
Our net income was $2,202,651 in 2020, compared to a net loss of ($1,522,964) in 2019. This is an increase in net income of $3,725,615. Our increase in net income was the result of $2,916,837 of other income recognized as part of our termination agreement of our manufacturing and supply agreement with Progenics couples with income from PPP SBA Loans converted to grant income of $546,100.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
On December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,113,032 compared to $575,422 at December 31, 2019. Net cash provided in operating activities was $1,149,625 in 2020, compared to net cash used by operating activities of $53,557 in 2019. This represents an increase in cash provided in operating activities of approximately $1,203,182.
Accounts receivable at December 31, 2020 were $796,128 as compared to $875,914 at December 31, 2019. Historically, we have not written off any accounts receivable, and there were no accounts written off during 2020 or 2019.
Inventories at December 31, 2020 were $837,787 as compared to $3,423,420 at December 31, 2019. The majority of our inventory consists of irradiated material held at the site of the DOE’s prime-operating contractor, which controls the ATR located outside of Idaho Falls, Idaho. For 2020, our target inventory accounted for approximately 88% of our work in process inventory and includes cobalt targets of an older design as well as irradiated cobalt material under a new contract with the DOE. During 2019, our target inventory accounted for approximately 89% of our work in process inventory. In 2020 and 2019, as part of our year-end procedures, we evaluated our older target inventory for impairment and concluded that these older design targets have varying but significant degrees of market value depending on any additional costs we may have to incur to transport them to our facility for processing.
Work in process includes costs to irradiate cobalt-60 material under a contract with the DOE. This material has been placed in the ATR and the Company made progress payments to purchase this material. In April 2020, we modified our agreement with the DOE due to delays in delivery of Cobalt material. As a result, the DOE refunded certain payments made by INIS in relation to this material and INIS stopped paying the scheduled payments for the inventory. Due to this modification in April 2020 work in process was reduced by $2,050,100 from a $918,090 cash refund from the DOE and a reduction of accounts payable of $1,132,010. In October 2020 we made an additional modification to our agreement with DOE, as a result we received a cash refund of $304,000 of our previous progress payments; and work in process was reduced by $304,000. For 2020, our cobalt target inventory accounted for approximately 89% of our work in process inventory as compared to 88% in 2019. In 2020, as part of our year-end procedures, we evaluated our older target inventory for impairment and concluded that these older design targets were fully impaired due to cumulative decay of the radioactive material. This impairment resulted in a $201,249 inventory impairment expense in 2020.
Included in our raw material inventory are raw cobalt, strontium and other raw elements. Raw material inventory is regularly reviewed for obsolescence.
Included in our work in process inventory are in-process and completed nuclear medicine products, irradiated cobalt and nuclear medicine-related materials and products.
We recognized a net income of $2,202,651, for the year ended December 31, 2020, and have an accumulated deficit of $125,861,734 since inception. To date, our operations and plant and equipment expenditures have been funded principally from proceeds from public and private sales of debt and equity as well as through asset sales.
Net cash provided in investing activities was $28,256 for 2020 and net cash used in investing activities for 2019 was $206,402. During 2020, we used $7,744 to purchase equipment, and we used $208,102 to purchase equipment in 2019. We had proceeds from sale of equipment of $36,000 in 2020, and we had no proceeds from sale of equipment in 2019.
Financing activities used cash of $637,109 for the year ended December 31, 2020. We received proceeds from the sale of common stock in the amount of $16,475 and issued debt for proceeds of $871,100. We made principal payment on loans in the amount of $1,519,920 in 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019, financing activities provided cash of $20,412. We received proceeds from the sale of common stock in the amount of $90,913 and issued debt for proceeds of $675,000. In addition, we made principal payment on loans in the amount of $739,111 in 2019.
In February 2017, we entered into subscription agreements with certain investors, including two of our directors, for the sale of (i) an aggregate of 3,433 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, and (ii) Class M warrants to purchase an aggregate of 17,165,000 shares of our common stock (Class M Warrants), for gross proceeds of $3,433,000. The Series C Preferred Stock accrues dividends at a rate of 6% per annum, payable annually on February 17th of each year, commencing on February 17, 2018. Shares of Series C Preferred Stock are convertible at the option of the holder at any time into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price equal to $0.10 per share, subject to adjustment. At any time after February 17, 2019, if the volume-weighted average closing price of our common stock over a period of 90 consecutive trading days is greater than $0.25 per share, we may redeem all or any portion of the outstanding Series C Preferred Stock at the original purchase price per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, payable in shares of common stock. All outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock must be redeemed by us on February 17, 2022 at the original purchase price per share, payable in cash or shares of common stock, at the option of the holder. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock do not have any voting rights, except as required by law and in connection with certain events as set forth in the Statement of Designation of the Series C Preferred Stock. The Class M Warrants are exercisable at an exercise price of $0.12 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth in the warrant, and have a term of five years.
In March 2017, we amended our 8% unsecured debentures issued that were scheduled to mature in July 2017 (the Notes) and gave the noteholders certain additional rights (the Amendment). Pursuant to the Amendment, the Notes were modified to provide each holder the right, at the holder’s option and exercisable prior to May 12, 2017, to convert all or any portion of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest, into shares of our Series C Preferred Stock at a conversion price of $1,000 per share. Holders that elected to convert their Notes into Series C Preferred Stock received a warrant to purchase up to 3,750 shares of our common stock for each share of Series C Preferred Stock received upon conversion of the Notes, with each warrant having a five-year term, a cashless exercise feature, and an exercise price of $0.10 per share of common stock. As a result of this modification, an aggregate of $780,000 of the Notes was converted to 780 shares of Series C Preferred Stock and 2,925,000 Class N Warrants (as defined below). Residual interest was also paid to Note holders who converted of $1,515. The Notes matured in July 2017 and were repaid in full.
As discussed above, in May 2017, we issued 780 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, and Class N warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2,925,000 shares of our common stock (Class N Warrants) upon conversion of $780,000 of the Notes. The Series C Preferred Stock accrues dividends at a rate of 6% per annum, payable annually on February 17th of each year, commencing on February 17, 2018. Shares of Series C Preferred Stock are convertible at the option of the holder at any time into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price equal to $0.12 per share, subject to adjustment. At any time after February 17, 2019, if the volume-weighted average closing price of our common stock over a period of 90 consecutive trading days is greater than $0.25 per share, we may redeem all or any portion of the outstanding Series C Preferred Stock at the original purchase price per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, payable in shares of common stock. All outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock must be redeemed by us on February 17, 2022 at the original purchase price per share, payable in cash or shares of common stock, at the option of the holder. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock do not have any voting rights, except as required by law and in connection with certain events as set forth in the Statement of Designation of the Series C Preferred Stock. The Class N Warrants are exercisable at an exercise price of $0.12 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth in the warrant, and have a term of five years.
In December 2013, we entered into a promissory note agreement with our then Chairman of the Board and one of our major shareholders, pursuant to which we borrowed $500,000 (the 2013 Promissory Note). The 2013 Promissory Note is secured and bears interest at 6% per annum and was originally due June 30, 2014. According to the terms of the 2013 Promissory Note, at any time, the lenders may settle any or all of the principal and accrued interest with shares of our common stock. In connection with the 2013 Promissory Note, each of the two lenders was issued 5,000,000 Class L warrants to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.06 per share. The warrants were immediately exercisable. In June 2014, we renegotiated the terms of the 2013 Promissory Note. Pursuant to the modification, the maturity date was extended to December 31, 2017 and each lender was granted an additional 7,500,000 Class L warrants to purchases shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.06 per share. The warrants were immediately exercisable. In February 2017, the 2013 Promissory Note was further modified to extend the maturity date to December 31, 2020, with all remaining terms unchanged. On December 23, 2018, all 25,000,000 Class L warrants expired. In December 2019, the 2013 Promissory Note was further modified to extend the maturity date to December 31, 2021, with all remaining terms unchanged.
In April 2018, we borrowed $120,000 from our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board pursuant to a promissory note (the 2018 Promissory Note). The 2018 Promissory Note accrues interest at 6% per annum, which is payable upon maturity of the 2018 Promissory Note. The 2018 Promissory Note was originally unsecured and originally matured on August 1, 2018. At any time, the holder of the 2018 Promissory Note may elect to have any or all of the principal and accrued interest settled with shares of our common stock based on the average price of the shares over the previous 20 trading days. Pursuant to an amendment to the 2018 Promissory Note in June 2018, the maturity date was extended to March 31, 2019 with all other provisions remaining unchanged. Pursuant to a second amendment to the 2018 Promissory Note in February 2019, the maturity date was extended to July 31, 2019 with all other provisions remaining unchanged. Pursuant to a third amendment to the 2018 Promissory Note in July 2019, the maturity date was extended to January 31, 2020 with all other provisions remaining unchanged. Pursuant to a fourth amendment to the 2018 Promissory Note in December 2019, the maturity date was extended to December 31, 2021, the note was modified to become secured by company assets, with all other provisions remaining unchanged.
In December 2019, we entered into a promissory note agreement with our Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board, former Chairman of the Board, and one of our major shareholders (the 2019 Promissory Note). The 2019 Promissory Note authorizes us to borrow up to $1,000,000. As of December 31, 2019, we borrowed $675,000 under the 2019 promissory note; the remaining $325,000 was borrowed in February 2020. The 2019 Promissory Note is secured and bears interest at 4% per annum and has a maturity date of December 31, 2022. According to the terms of the 2019 Promissory Note, at any time, a holder of the 2019 Promissory Note may elect to have any or all of the principal and accrued interest settled with shares of our common stock based on the average price of the shares over the previous 20 trading days. In connection with the 2019 Promissory Note, we are required to issue up to 30,000,000 Class O Warrants to purchase shares of our common stock at $0.045 per share (the Class O Warrants). The warrants are exercisable at an exercise price of $0.045 per share and have a term of five years.
On April 23, 2020, through our wholly-owned subsidiary entered into a Loan Agreement and Promissory Note (collectively the “SBA Loan”) with KeyBank National Association pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) under the recently enacted Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”). The Company received total proceeds of $546,100 from the SBA Loan. The SBA Loan is scheduled to mature on April 22, 2022 and has a 1.00% interest rate and is subject to the terms and conditions applicable to loans administered by the SBA under the CARES Act. The SBA Loan may be prepaid at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties.
The SBA Loan contains customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults and breaches of representations and warranties. Subject to certain conditions, the SBA Loan may be forgiven in whole or in part by applying for forgiveness pursuant to the CARES Act and the PPP. The amount of loan proceeds eligible for forgiveness is based on a formula based on a number of factors, including the amount of loan proceeds used by us during the twenty-four week period after the loan origination for certain purposes, including payroll costs, interest on certain mortgage obligations, rent payments on certain leases, and certain qualified utility payments, provided that, among other things, at least 60% of the loan amount is used for eligible payroll costs, the employer maintaining or rehiring employees and maintaining salaries at certain level.
As of September 30, 2020, we have used the entire loan proceeds to fund qualifying expenses. As a result, we believe that it has met the PPP eligibility criteria for forgiveness and has concluded that the loan represents, in substance, a government grant that is expected to be forgiven. As such, we have recognized the entire loan amount as ‘Other Income’ in the period ending December 31, 2020.
We do not anticipate taking any action that would cause any portion of the loan to be ineligible for forgiveness. However, to the extent that any amount is deemed unforgivable, such amount is payable over two to five years at an interest rate of 1%, with a deferral of payments for the first six months.
We expect that cash from operations, cash obtained through securities offerings, and our current cash balance will be sufficient to fund operations for the next twelve months. Although we may seek additional debt financing for our projects and operations in the future, there is no assurance that we will be able to secure additional debt financing on acceptable terms to us, or at all.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations.
Goals for 2021
Based upon the investments we have made in our facilities and investments we anticipate making, and based on projects, and products developed thus far in 2021, we have the following goals for the rest of 2020:
 Continue to expand sales of our FDA approved sodium iodide I-131 generic drug product;
 Begin development of one or more new generic drug products to further enhance revenue production within our Radiochemical segment and identify additional future generic product opportunities;
 Expand sales of our nuclear medicine products and increase cash flow by offering new products and further expanding our international sales and distributor relationships;
 Develop a business plan to produce additional radiopharmaceutical products or explore new contract manufacturing opportunities in our new expanded facility using the improvements and equipment we received from our previous contract termination agreement.
 Support research and development of an advanced COVID test at a leading research hospital, with a goal of developing an accurate, inexpensive, at home saliva-based test.
 Continue to expand our customer base, increase revenues, reduce production and operating costs, and attempt to achieve profitability in our core business segment operations; and
 Continue to support essential tasks related to our de-conversion project and continue to pursue any opportunities to obtain additional contracts for depleted uranium de-conversion.
Critical Accounting Policies
Revenue recognition - We recognize revenue when products ship or services are performed according to predetermined amounts per customer contract obligations or milestones. We have contracted with several customers for the purchase of cobalt-60 material which is currently undergoing irradiation. We have collected advance payments from these customers for project management and up-front handling and irradiation charges and these prepayments have been recorded as unearned revenue. Our estimated future recognition of this unearned revenue is based on an irradiation completion and shipment schedule and on product shipment dates and service performance dates.
Patents and other intangibles - We amortize our patents and intangibles using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Patents and other intangibles are evaluated for impairment annually or when events or circumstances arise that indicate the existence of impairment. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an intangible asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to, (1) a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, (2) a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or (3) an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition of an asset. If impairment indicators exist, we measure the carrying amount of the asset against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with it. Should the sum of the expected future cash flows be less than the carrying value of the asset being evaluated, an impairment loss would be recognized. The impairment loss would be calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.
Impairment of long-lived assets - As part of our year-end procedures we test our long-lived assets for signs of impairment when indicators of impairment exist. If impairment indicators exist, we measure the carrying value of the asset against its estimated future cash flows. If the expected future value is less than the carrying value of the asset an impairment loss would be recognized.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Asset retirement obligation - The asset retirement obligation is based on the expected future cash flows of the decommissioning funding plan. The decommissioning funding plan is based on the estimated number of hours of specific personnel, estimated wages and disposal costs. Once the decommissioning funding plan has been developed, we use a discount rate to determine the estimated current value of the liability.
New Accounting Standards
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases” which was issued to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The amendments in ASU 2016-02 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We recorded an adjustment in January 2019, to both the assets and liabilities to recognize a lease related to real estate.
In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, “Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting”, which expands the scope of Topic 718 to include all share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. ASU 2018-07 specifies that Topic 718 applies to all share-based payment transactions in which the grantor acquires goods and services to be used or consumed in its own operations by issuing share-based payment awards. ASU 2018-07 also clarifies that Topic 718 does not apply to share-based payments used to effectively provide (1) financing to the issuer or (2) awards granted in conjunction with selling goods or services to customers as part of a contract accounted for under ASC 606. The amendments in ASU 2018-07 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We have assessed this topic and have concluded that there will be no impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
