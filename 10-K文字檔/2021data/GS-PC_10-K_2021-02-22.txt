Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Executive Overview
We generated net earnings of $9.46 billion for 2020, an increase of 12% compared with $8.47 billion for 2019. Diluted earnings per common share (EPS) was $24.74 for 2020, an increase of 18% compared with $21.03 for 2019. Return on average common shareholders’ equity (ROE) was 11.1% for 2020, compared with 10.0% for 2019. Book value per common share was $236.15 as of December 2020, 8.1% higher compared with December 2019.
During 2020, we recorded net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $3.42 billion, which reduced diluted EPS by $9.51 and reduced ROE by 3.9 percentage points. During 2019, we recorded net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $1.24 billion, which reduced diluted EPS by $3.16 and reduced ROE by 1.5 percentage points.
Net revenues were $44.56 billion for 2020, 22% higher than 2019. Net revenues were significantly higher in both Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) and Equities within Global Markets, driven by strong client activity, and in Investment Banking, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in both Equity and Debt underwriting. Net revenues in Consumer & Wealth Management were higher, reflecting growth in Wealth management and Consumer banking. These increases were partially offset by lower net revenues in Asset Management, due to significantly lower net revenues in Equity investments and Lending and debt investments, which reflected the impact of a challenging environment earlier this year.
Provision for credit losses was $3.10 billion for 2020, compared with $1.07 billion for 2019. This increase was primarily due to significantly higher provisions related to wholesale loans as a result of individual impairments and ratings downgrades during the year, as well as deterioration and uncertainty in the broader economic environment (incorporating the accounting for credit losses under the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) standard) reflecting the impact of the global outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19)
pandemic. The increase also included higher provisions related to credit card loans, due to growth in the portfolio. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about ASU No. 2016-13,
“Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.”
Operating expenses were $28.98 billion for 2020, 16% higher than 2019, primarily reflecting significantly higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings, higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting improved financial performance) and higher transaction based expenses (reflecting an increase in activity levels). Our efficiency ratio (total operating expenses divided by total net revenues) for 2020 was 65.0%, compared with 68.1% for 2019. Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings increased our efficiency ratio for 2020 by 7.6 percentage points and for 2019 by 3.4 percentage points.
During 2020, we returned $3.72 billion of capital to common shareholders, including $1.93 billion of common share repurchases, all during the first quarter, and $1.80 billion in common stock dividends. As of December 2020, our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio was 14.7% under the Standardized Capital Rules and 13.4% under the Advanced Capital Rules. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our capital ratios.
In the beginning of 2020, we announced strategic initiatives related to expense efficiencies and funding optimization with an emphasis on improving profitability and shareholder returns. We estimated that by year-end
2022 we will generate (i) $1.3 billion of annual run-rate
expense efficiencies, which will create capacity to fund growth, and (ii) $1.0 billion of annual run-rate
interest expense savings through funding optimization from the growth of deposits and the reduction of wholesale unsecured funding. During 2020, we achieved approximately half of the expense efficiencies target of $1.3 billion, which enabled us to partially offset the cost of investment in our business and our people in 2020. While we did not achieve interest expense savings during 2020, we remain focused on achieving the $1.0 billion interest expense savings by year-end
2022, based on the current pricing of our consumer deposits, as well as higher deposit balances.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Business Environment
In the beginning of 2020, the spread of COVID-19
across the globe and the accompanying temporary closures of non-essential
businesses and stay-at-home
requirements caused a sharp contraction in global economic activity, widespread unemployment, high levels of volatility across most financial assets and global markets, an unprecedented decline in global equity prices, and a significant widening of credit spreads. Global central banks responded quickly with accommodative monetary policy by reducing policy interest rates and increasing large scale asset purchases, and the establishment of a number of facilities to support the functioning of markets and to provide liquidity to markets. In addition, governments globally intervened with fiscal policy to mitigate the impact, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in the U.S., which provided economic relief to businesses and individuals. These monetary and fiscal interventions, combined with the reopening of businesses and relaxation of earlier lockdowns, contributed to a sharp rebound in global economic activity during the second half of 2020. As a result, investors became more optimistic towards the prospect of a quicker economic recovery and a return to pre-pandemic
levels, effecting sharp increases in equity prices and tighter credit spreads. Late in the year, medical professionals developed effective COVID-19
vaccines and governments began to distribute them globally, which is expected to reduce virus spread and further aid economic recovery. Additionally, the U.S. concluded a presidential election, and a second pandemic-aid
bill was passed that included additional unemployment benefits and direct payments to individuals.
Despite broad improvements in the overall economy since the pandemic began, there continues to be uncertainty related to the prospects for economic growth, virus resurgence, vaccine distribution, further fiscal stimulus and geopolitical risks. See “Results of Operations - Segment Operating Results” for further information about the operating environment for each of our business segments.
Critical Accounting Policies
Fair Value
Fair Value Hierarchy.
Trading assets and liabilities, certain investments and loans, and certain other financial assets and liabilities, are included in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value (i.e., marked-to-market),
with related gains or losses generally recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings. The use of fair value to measure financial instruments is fundamental to our risk management practices and is our most critical accounting policy.
The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We measure certain financial assets and liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks). In determining fair value, the hierarchy under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) gives (i) the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities (level 1 inputs), (ii) the next priority to inputs other than level 1 inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly (level 2 inputs), and (iii) the lowest priority to inputs that cannot be observed in market activity (level 3 inputs). In evaluating the significance of a valuation input, we consider, among other factors, a portfolio’s net risk exposure to that input. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement.
The fair values for substantially all of our financial assets and liabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain level 2 and level 3 financial assets and liabilities may require appropriate valuation adjustments that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value for factors, such as counterparty and our credit quality, funding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads.
Instruments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are those which require one or more significant inputs that are not observable. Level 3 financial assets represented 2.3% as of both December 2020 and December 2019, of our total assets. See Notes 4 through 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about level 3 financial assets, including changes in level 3 financial assets and related fair value measurements. Absent evidence to the contrary, instruments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are initially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. Subsequent to the transaction date, we use other methodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on the type of instrument. Estimating the fair value of level 3 financial instruments requires judgments to be made. These judgments include:
•
Determining the appropriate valuation methodology and/or model for each type of level 3 financial instrument;
•
Determining model inputs based on an evaluation of all relevant empirical market data, including prices evidenced by market transactions, interest rates, credit spreads, volatilities and correlations; and
•
Determining appropriate valuation adjustments, including those related to illiquidity or counterparty credit quality.
Regardless of the methodology, valuation inputs and assumptions are only changed when corroborated by substantive evidence.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Controls Over Valuation of Financial Instruments.
Market makers and investment professionals in our revenue-producing units are responsible for pricing our financial instruments. Our control infrastructure is independent of the revenue-producing units and is fundamental to ensuring that all of our financial instruments are appropriately valued at market-clearing levels. In the event that there is a difference of opinion in situations where estimating the fair value of financial instruments requires judgment (e.g., calibration to market comparables or trade comparison, as described below), the final valuation decision is made by senior managers in independent risk oversight and control functions. This independent price verification is critical to ensuring that our financial instruments are properly valued.
Price Verification.
All financial instruments at fair value classified in levels 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy are subject to our independent price verification process. The objective of price verification is to have an informed and independent opinion with regard to the valuation of financial instruments under review. Instruments that have one or more significant inputs which cannot be corroborated by external market data are classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Price verification strategies utilized by our independent risk oversight and control functions include:
•
Trade Comparison.
Analysis of trade data (both internal and external, where available) is used to determine the most relevant pricing inputs and valuations.
•
External Price Comparison.
Valuations and prices are compared to pricing data obtained from third parties (e.g., brokers or dealers, IHS Markit, Bloomberg, IDC, TRACE). Data obtained from various sources is compared to ensure consistency and validity. When broker or dealer quotations or third-party pricing vendors are used for valuation or price verification, greater priority is generally given to executable quotations.
•
Calibration to Market Comparables.
Market-based transactions are used to corroborate the valuation of positions with similar characteristics, risks and components.
•
Relative Value Analyses.
Market-based transactions are analyzed to determine the similarity, measured in terms of risk, liquidity and return, of one instrument relative to another or, for a given instrument, of one maturity relative to another.
•
Collateral Analyses.
Margin calls on derivatives are analyzed to determine implied values, which are used to corroborate our valuations.
•
Execution of Trades.
Where appropriate, market-making desks are instructed to execute trades in order to provide evidence of market-clearing levels.
•
Backtesting.
Valuations are corroborated by comparison to values realized upon sales.
See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about fair value measurements.
Review of Net Revenues.
Independent risk oversight and control functions ensure adherence to our pricing policy through a combination of daily procedures, including the explanation and attribution of net revenues based on the underlying factors. Through this process, we independently validate net revenues, identify and resolve potential fair value or trade booking issues on a timely basis and seek to ensure that risks are being properly categorized and quantified.
Review of Valuation Models.
Our independent model risk management group (Model Risk), consisting of quantitative professionals who are separate from model developers, performs an independent model review and validation process of our valuation models. New or changed models are reviewed and approved prior to implementation. Models are reviewed annually to assess the impact of any changes in the product or market and any market developments in pricing theories. See “Risk Management - Model Risk Management” for further information about the review and validation of our valuation models.
Allowance for Credit Losses
We estimate and record an allowance for credit losses related to our loans held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost. We adopted ASU No. 2016-13
in January 2020, which replaced the probable incurred credit loss model for recognizing credit losses with the CECL model. As a result, our allowance for credit losses effective January 2020, reflects our estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of such loans and also takes into account forecasts of future economic conditions. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about adoption of ASU No. 2016-13.
To determine the allowance for credit losses, we classify our loans accounted for at amortized cost into wholesale and consumer portfolios. These portfolios represent the level at which we have developed and documented our methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics using a modeled approach and asset-specific basis for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics. The allowance for credit losses also includes qualitative components which allow management to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision and concentration risk. The determination of allowance for credit losses entails significant judgment on various risk factors. Risk factors for wholesale loans include internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, macroeconomic indicators (e.g., unemployment rates and GDP), the borrower’s capacity to meet its financial obligations, the borrower’s country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. In addition, for loans backed by real estate, risk factors include loan-to-value
ratio, debt service ratio and home price index. Risk factors for installment and credit card loans include Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores, delinquency status, loan vintage and macroeconomic indicators.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Our estimate of credit losses entails judgment about collectability at the reporting dates, and there are uncertainties inherent in those judgments. The allowance for credit losses is subject to a governance process that involves review and approval by senior management within our independent risk oversight and control functions. Personnel within our independent risk oversight and control functions are responsible for forecasting the economic variables that underlie the economic scenarios that are used in the modeling of expected credit losses. While we use the best information available to determine this estimate, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on, among other things, changes in the economic environment or variances between actual results and the original assumptions used. Loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when deemed to be uncollectible.
We also record an allowance for credit losses on lending commitments which are held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost. Such allowance is determined using the same methodology as the allowance for loan losses, while also taking into consideration the probability of drawdowns or funding, and whether such commitments are cancellable by us. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the allowance for credit losses.
Use of Estimates
U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions. In addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost, the use of estimates and assumptions is also important in determining the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, provisions for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations), and provisions for losses that may arise from tax audits.
Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist. When assessing goodwill for impairment, first, a qualitative assessment can be made to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its estimated carrying value. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a quantitative goodwill test can be performed without performing a qualitative assessment.
Estimating the fair value of our reporting units requires judgment. Critical inputs to the fair value estimates include projected earnings and allocated equity. There is inherent uncertainty in the projected earnings. The estimated carrying value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders’ equity and represents the estimated amount of total shareholders’ equity required to support the activities of the reporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital requirements. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill.
If we experience a prolonged or severe period of weakness in the business environment, financial markets, our performance or our common stock price, or additional increases in capital requirements, our goodwill could be impaired in the future.
Identifiable intangible assets are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset’s or asset group’s carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Judgment is required to evaluate whether indications of potential impairment have occurred, and to test intangible assets for impairment, if required. An impairment is recognized if the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about identifiable intangible assets.
We also estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss in excess of the related reserves for litigation and regulatory proceedings where we believe the risk of loss is more than slight. See Notes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements for information about certain judicial, litigation and regulatory proceedings. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. Our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case
basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, proceeding or investigation, our experience and the experience of others in similar cases, proceedings or investigations, and the opinions and views of legal counsel.
In accounting for income taxes, we recognize tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. See Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about income taxes.

Results of Operations
The composition of our net revenues has varied over time as financial markets and the scope of our operations have changed. The composition of net revenues can also vary over the shorter term due to fluctuations in U.S. and global economic and market conditions. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K
for further information about the impact of economic and market conditions on our results of operations. For a discussion of our 2019 financial results compared with 2018, see Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Financial Overview
The table below presents an overview of our financial results and selected financial ratios.
In the table above:
•
Net earnings to common represents net earnings applicable to common shareholders, which is calculated as net earnings less preferred stock dividends.
•
Average equity to average assets is calculated by dividing average total shareholders’ equity by average total assets.
•
Dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing dividends declared per common share by diluted EPS.
•
ROE is calculated by dividing net earnings to common by average monthly common shareholders’ equity. Tangible common shareholders’ equity is calculated as total shareholders’ equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity (ROTE) is calculated by dividing net earnings to common by average monthly tangible common shareholders’ equity. We believe that tangible common shareholders’ equity is meaningful because it is a measure that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy and that ROTE is meaningful because it measures the performance of businesses consistently, whether they were acquired or developed internally. Tangible common shareholders’ equity and ROTE are non-GAAP
measures and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP
measures used by other companies. Return on average shareholders’ equity is calculated by dividing net earnings by average monthly shareholders’ equity.
The table below presents our average equity and the reconciliation of average common shareholders’ equity to average tangible common shareholders’ equity.
Net Revenues
The table below presents our net revenues by line item.
In the table above:
•
Investment banking consists of revenues (excluding net interest) from financial advisory and underwriting assignments. These activities are included in our Investment Banking segment.
•
Investment management consists of revenues (excluding net interest) from providing asset management services across all major asset classes to a diverse set of asset management clients (included in our Asset Management segment), as well as asset management services, wealth advisory services and certain transaction services for wealth management clients (included in our Consumer & Wealth Management segment).
•
Commissions and fees consists of revenues from executing and clearing client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide, as well as over-the-counter
(OTC) transactions. These activities are included in our Global Markets and Consumer & Wealth Management segments.
•
Market making consists of revenues (excluding net interest) from client execution activities related to making markets in interest rate products, credit products, mortgages, currencies, commodities and equity products. These activities are included in our Global Markets segment.
•
Other principal transactions consists of revenues (excluding net interest) from our equity investing activities, including revenues related to our consolidated investments (included in our Asset Management segment), and lending activities (included across our four segments).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Operating Environment.
During 2020, the COVID-19
pandemic broadly impacted the operating environment, contributing to lower global equity prices and wider credit spreads earlier in the year. The ensuing financial market volatility and negative impact to global economic activity were counteracted, in part, by monetary and fiscal support from central banks and governments globally, which contributed to a sharp rebound in global equity prices and tighter credit spreads. Market-making activities benefitted from higher levels of volatility, higher client activity, and wider bid-ask
spreads. Investment banking activities benefitted from high levels of industry-wide underwriting volumes, while industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions volumes decreased, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on announcements in the first half of 2020.
If the ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic turn out to be ineffective, it may lead to a decline in market-making activity levels, a continued decline in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions volumes, or a decline in industry-wide underwriting volumes, and declines in global equity markets or widening of credit spreads, and net revenues and the provision for credit losses would likely be negatively impacted. See “Segment Operating Results” for information about the operating environment and material trends and uncertainties that may impact our results of operations.
2020 versus 2019.
Net revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $44.56 billion for 2020, 22% higher than 2019, reflecting significantly higher market making and investment banking revenues, and higher investment management revenues, commissions and fees and net interest income, partially offset by significantly lower other principal transactions revenues.
Non-Interest
Revenues.
Investment banking revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $9.14 billion for 2020, 34% higher than 2019, due to significantly higher revenues in both equity and debt underwriting, reflecting an increase in industry-wide volumes. These increases were partially offset by slightly lower revenues in financial advisory, reflecting a decrease in industry-wide completed merger and acquisitions transactions.
Investment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $6.92 billion for 2020, 12% higher than 2019, primarily due to higher management and other fees, reflecting the impact of higher average assets under supervision (AUS) and the impact of the full-year consolidation of GS Personal Financial Management, partially offset by a lower average effective management fee due to shifts in the mix of client assets and strategies. In addition, incentive fees were significantly higher, primarily driven by performance.
Commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of earnings were $3.55 billion for 2020, 19% higher than 2019, reflecting an increase in our listed cash equity volumes, generally consistent with market volumes.
Market making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $15.55 billion for 2020, 53% higher than 2019, primarily due to significantly higher revenues in equity products (both derivatives and cash products), credit products, interest rate products, commodities and currencies.
Other principal transactions revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $4.65 billion for 2020, 23% lower than 2019, reflecting significantly lower net gains from investments in private equities and net losses from debt investments, partially offset by significantly higher net gains from investments in public equities.
Net Interest Income.
Net interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $4.75 billion for 2020, 9% higher than 2019, reflecting a decrease in interest expense primarily related to other interest-bearing liabilities, collateralized financings, long-term borrowings and deposits, each reflecting the impact of lower interest rates, partially offset by the impact of higher average balances for deposits. The decrease in interest expense was largely offset by a decrease in interest income primarily related to collateralized agreements, other interest-earning assets and deposits with banks, each reflecting the impact of lower interest rates. See “Statistical Disclosures - Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity” for further information about our sources of net interest income.
Provision for Credit Losses
Provision for credit losses consists of provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the provision for credit losses.
The table below presents our provision for credit losses.
Goldman Sachs 2020 Form 10-K
THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
2020 versus 2019.
Provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of earnings was $3.10 billion for 2020, compared with $1.07 billion for 2019. This increase was primarily due to significantly higher provisions related to wholesale loans as a result of individual impairments (approximately $1.15 billion primarily related to borrowers in the diversified industrials, technology, media & telecommunications and natural resources industries) and ratings downgrades during the year, as well as deterioration and uncertainty in the broader economic environment (incorporating the accounting for credit losses under the CECL standard) reflecting the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic. The increase also included higher provisions related to credit card loans, due to growth in the portfolio. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about ASU No. 2016-13.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses are primarily influenced by compensation, headcount and levels of business activity. Compensation and benefits includes salaries, year-end
discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits. Discretionary compensation is significantly impacted by, among other factors, the level of net revenues, overall financial performance, prevailing labor markets, business mix, the structure of our share-based compensation programs and the external environment.
The table below presents our operating expenses by line item and headcount.
In the table above, brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees has been renamed transaction based and additionally includes expenses resulting from completed transactions, which are directly related to client revenues. Such expenses were previously reported in other expenses and were $314 million for 2020 ($55 million for the first quarter of 2020, $69 million for the second quarter of 2020, $100 million for the third quarter of 2020 and $90 million for the fourth quarter of 2020), $261 million for 2019 and $292 million for 2018. Previously reported amounts have been conformed to the current presentation.
2020 versus 2019.
Operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $28.98 billion for 2020, 16% higher than 2019. Our efficiency ratio (total operating expenses divided by total net revenues) for 2020 was 65.0%, compared with 68.1% for 2019. Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings increased our efficiency ratio for 2020 by 7.6 percentage points and for 2019 by 3.4 percentage points.
The increase in operating expenses compared with 2019 primarily reflected significantly higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings and higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting improved financial performance). In addition, transaction based expenses were higher (reflecting an increase in activity levels), technology expenses were higher and expenses related to consolidated investments, including impairments, were also higher (increase was primarily in depreciation and amortization and occupancy expenses). The increase also reflected higher charitable contributions (included in other expenses), which included approximately $300 million to Goldman Sachs Gives and approximately $125 million to The Goldman Sachs Foundation during 2020. These increases were partially offset by significantly lower travel and entertainment expenses (included in market development expenses) and lower occupancy-related expenses.
Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for 2020 were $3.42 billion compared with $1.24 billion for 2019.
Headcount increased 6% compared with December 2019, reflecting investments in new business initiatives and an increase in technology professionals.
Provision for Taxes
The effective income tax rate for 2020 was 24.2%, up from the full year income tax rate of 20.0% for 2019, primarily due to an increase in provisions for non-deductible
litigation.
The CARES Act was enacted in March 2020. The CARES Act includes retroactive and prospective provisions enacted to provide income tax relief and liquidity to businesses affected by the COVID-19
pandemic. The legislation includes corporate income tax provisions that temporarily allow for the carryback of net operating losses and remove limitations on the use of loss carryforwards, increase interest expense deduction limitations and allow accelerated depreciation deductions on certain asset improvements. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on our effective income tax rate for 2020.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
In July 2020, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Department of the Treasury released final regulations that include an election to exempt income that is subject to a high rate of tax from Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) and proposed regulations that would conform the high-tax
elections for purposes of GILTI and Subpart F. These final and proposed regulations did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate for 2020. In September 2020, Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax regulations were released finalizing proposed regulations and supplementing final regulations that were released in 2019. These final regulations did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate for 2020.
Additionally, in July 2020, the U.K. Finance Act 2020 (Finance Act) was enacted. The Finance Act includes a repeal of a two percentage point decrease in the U.K. corporate income tax rate that was scheduled to become effective in April 2020. The impact of this legislation did not have a material impact on our effective income tax rate for 2020.
We expect our 2021 income tax rate to be approximately 21%, excluding the impact of income tax benefits on employee share-based awards and any potential changes in current income tax rates.
Segment Assets and Operating Results
Segment Assets.
The table below presents assets by segment.
The allocation process for segment assets is based on the activities of these segments. The allocation of assets includes allocation of global core liquid assets (GCLA) (which consists of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash), which is generally included within cash and cash equivalents, collateralized agreements and trading assets on our balance sheet. Due to the integrated nature of these segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating these assets. See “Risk Management - Liquidity Risk Management” for further information about our GCLA.
Segment Operating Results.
The table below presents our segment operating results.
Net revenues in our segments include allocations of interest income and expense to specific positions in relation to the cash generated by, or funding requirements of, such positions. See Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our business segments.
The allocation of common shareholders’ equity and preferred stock dividends to each segment is based on the estimated amount of equity required to support the activities of the segment under relevant regulatory capital requirements. Net earnings for each segment is calculated by applying the firmwide tax rate to each segment’s pre-tax
earnings.
Compensation and benefits expenses within our segments reflect, among other factors, our overall performance, as well as the performance of individual businesses. Consequently, pre-tax
margins in one segment of our business may be significantly affected by the performance of our other business segments. A description of segment operating results follows.

Investment Banking
Investment Banking generates revenues from the following:
•
Financial advisory.
Includes strategic advisory assignments with respect to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense activities, restructurings and spin-offs.
•
Underwriting.
Includes public offerings and private placements, including local and cross-border transactions and acquisition financing, of a wide range of securities and other financial instruments, including loans.
•
Corporate lending.
Includes lending to corporate clients, including through relationship lending, middle-market lending and acquisition financing. We also provide transaction banking services to certain of our corporate clients.
The table below presents our Investment Banking assets.
The table below presents our Investment Banking operating results.
The table below presents our financial advisory and underwriting transaction volumes.
In the table above:
•
Volumes are per Dealogic.
•
Announced and completed mergers and acquisitions volumes are based on full credit to each of the advisors in a transaction. Equity and equity-related offerings and debt offerings are based on full credit for single book managers and equal credit for joint book managers. Transaction volumes may not be indicative of net revenues in a given period. In addition, transaction volumes for prior periods may vary from amounts previously reported due to the subsequent withdrawal or a change in the value of a transaction.
•
Equity and equity-related offerings includes Rule 144A and public common stock offerings, convertible offerings and rights offerings.
•
Debt offerings includes non-convertible
preferred stock, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and taxable municipal debt. Includes publicly registered and Rule 144A issues and excludes leveraged loans.
Operating Environment.
During the year, the COVID-19
pandemic broadly impacted the economic environment and had a mixed impact on investment banking activity. In mergers and acquisitions, industry-wide announced transactions were negatively impacted by the pandemic, primarily in the middle of the year, contributing to a year-over-year decline in industry-wide completed transactions. In underwriting, equity valuations and a desire by clients to raise cash to strengthen their balance sheets, combined with the lower rate environment, contributed to high levels of activity across equity underwriting, including initial public offerings, and higher volumes in debt underwriting. Corporate clients increased borrowing under revolving lines of credit to address liquidity needs in the beginning of the pandemic, but have since paid down borrowed funds following the stabilization of credit markets.
In the future, if industry-wide announced and completed mergers and acquisitions volumes continue to decline, or if industry-wide equity and debt underwriting volumes decline, or credit spreads related to hedges on our relationship lending portfolio continue to tighten, net revenues in Investment Banking would likely be negatively impacted. In addition, a deterioration in the creditworthiness of borrowers would negatively impact the provision for credit losses.
2020 versus 2019.
Net revenues in Investment Banking were $9.42 billion for 2020, 24% higher than 2019, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in Underwriting. This increase was partially offset by significantly lower net revenues in Corporate lending and slightly lower net revenues in Financial advisory.
Goldman Sachs 2020 Form 10-K
THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The increase in Underwriting net revenues was due to significantly higher net revenues in both Equity and Debt underwriting, reflecting an increase in industry-wide volumes. The decrease in Corporate lending net revenues primarily reflected net mark-downs on corporate loans in 2020 compared to net gains in 2019. The decrease in Financial advisory net revenues reflected a decrease in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions, primarily in the middle of the year.
Provision for credit losses was $1.62 billion for 2020, compared with $333 million for 2019, reflecting higher impairments related to relationship lending and middle-market lending and reserve increases as a result of the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on the broader economic environment (incorporating the accounting for credit losses under the CECL standard). See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about ASU No. 2016-13.
Operating expenses were $6.13 billion for 2020, 31% higher than 2019, primarily due to significantly higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings. Pre-tax
earnings were $1.67 billion for 2020, 35% lower than 2019. Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings reduced ROE by 11.5 percentage points for 2020.
As of December 2020, our investment banking transaction backlog increased significantly compared with December 2019, due to significantly higher estimated net revenues from potential equity underwriting transactions, primarily from initial public offerings, and higher estimated net revenues from potential advisory transactions. Estimated net revenues from potential debt underwriting transactions were essentially unchanged.
Our backlog represents an estimate of our net revenues from future transactions where we believe that future revenue realization is more likely than not. We believe changes in our backlog may be a useful indicator of client activity levels which, over the long term, impact our net revenues. However, the time frame for completion and corresponding revenue recognition of transactions in our backlog varies based on the nature of the assignment, as certain transactions may remain in our backlog for longer periods of time, which could occur in light of the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on mergers and acquisitions. In addition, our backlog is subject to certain limitations, such as assumptions about the likelihood that individual client transactions will occur in the future. Transactions may be cancelled or modified, and transactions not included in the estimate may also occur, including underwriting transactions for which the time frame from discussion to completion has shortened in the current environment.

Equities.
Equities generates revenues from intermediation and financing activities.
•
Equities intermediation.
We make markets in equity securities and equity-related products, including ETFs, convertible securities, options, futures and over-the-counter
(OTC) derivative instruments. We also structure and make markets in derivatives on indices, industry sectors, financial measures and individual company stocks. Our exchange-based market-making activities include making markets in stocks and ETFs, futures and options on major exchanges worldwide. In addition, we generate commissions and fees from executing and clearing institutional client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide, as well as OTC transactions. For further information about market-making activities, see “Market-Making Activities” below.
•
Equities financing.
Includes prime brokerage and other equities financing activities, including securities lending, margin lending and swaps. We earn fees by providing clearing, settlement and custody services globally. We provide services that principally involve borrowing and lending securities to cover institutional clients’ short sales and borrowing securities to cover our short sales and to make deliveries into the market. In addition, we are an active participant in broker-to-broker
securities lending and third-party agency lending activities. We provide financing to our clients for their securities trading activities through margin loans that are collateralized by securities, cash or other acceptable collateral. In addition, we execute swap transactions to provide our clients with exposure to securities and indices.
Market-Making Activities
As a market maker, we facilitate transactions in both liquid and less liquid markets, primarily for institutional clients, such as corporations, financial institutions, investment funds and governments, to assist clients in meeting their investment objectives and in managing their risks. In this role, we seek to earn the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument to us and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it from us, and vice versa (i.e., bid/offer spread). In addition, we maintain (i) market-making positions, typically for a short period of time, in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand, and (ii) positions to actively manage our risk exposures that arise from these market-making activities (collectively, inventory). Our inventory is recorded in trading assets (long positions) or trading liabilities (short positions) in our consolidated balance sheets.
Our results are influenced by a combination of interconnected drivers, including (i) client activity levels and transactional bid/offer spreads (collectively, client activity), and (ii) changes in the fair value of our inventory and interest income and interest expense related to the holding, hedging and funding of our inventory (collectively, market-making inventory changes). Due to the integrated nature of our market-making activities, disaggregation of net revenues into client activity and market-making inventory changes is judgmental and has inherent complexities and limitations.
The amount and composition of our net revenues vary over time as these drivers are impacted by multiple interrelated factors affecting economic and market conditions, including volatility and liquidity in the market, changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit spreads, equity prices and commodity prices, investor confidence, and other macroeconomic concerns and uncertainties.
In general, assuming all other market-making conditions remain constant, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads tend to result in increases in net revenues, and decreases tend to have the opposite effect. However, changes in market-making conditions can materially impact client activity levels and bid/offer spreads, as well as the fair value of our inventory. For example, a decrease in liquidity in the market could have the impact of (i) increasing our bid/offer spread, (ii) decreasing investor confidence and thereby decreasing client activity levels, and (iii) widening of credit spreads on our inventory positions.

•
The primary driver of net revenues for FICC intermediation was client activity.
Operating Environment.
During 2020, Global Markets operated in an environment characterized by strong client activity, higher volatility, and wider bid-ask
spreads compared with 2019, as clients reacted to economic uncertainty amid the COVID-19
pandemic by repositioning investment portfolios and hedging risks across asset classes. During the initial stages of the pandemic, equity prices decreased sharply and credit spreads widened as global economic activity declined. In response, central banks and governments globally intervened with monetary easing and fiscal stimulus. This support, in conjunction with improved sentiment regarding the pace of the economic recovery, contributed to a sharp rebound in global equity prices and tighter credit spreads. At the end of 2020, the S&P 500 Index was 16% higher and the MSCI World Index was 14% higher than the end of 2019. U.S. investment-grade credit spreads were approximately 5 basis points tighter compared with the end of 2019. Additionally, market volatility was elevated as the average daily VIX was 29 for 2020, compared with an average of 15 for 2019. If macroeconomic conditions lead to a decline in activity levels, bid-ask
spreads or volatility, net revenues in Global Markets would likely be negatively impacted.
2020 versus 2019.
Net revenues in Global Markets were $21.16 billion for 2020, 43% higher than 2019.
Net revenues in FICC were $11.58 billion, 57% higher than 2019, primarily due to significantly higher net revenues in FICC intermediation, reflecting significantly higher net revenues across all major businesses. In addition, net revenues in FICC financing were higher, driven by resale agreements.
The increase in FICC intermediation net revenues reflected significantly higher client activity. The following provides information about our FICC intermediation net revenues by business, compared with 2019 results:
•
Net revenues in credit products, interest rate products, currencies and mortgages reflected higher client activity.
•
Net revenues in commodities reflected the impact of improved market-making conditions on our inventory and higher client activity.
Net revenues in Equities were $9.57 billion, 30% higher than 2019, due to significantly higher net revenues in Equities intermediation, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in both derivatives and cash products. This increase was partially offset by lower net revenues in Equities financing, primarily reflecting higher net funding costs, including the impact of lower yields on our global core liquid assets.
Provision for credit losses was $274 million for 2020, compared with $35 million for 2019, reflecting loan growth and reserve increases as a result of the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on the broader economic environment (incorporating the accounting for credit losses under the CECL standard). See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about ASU No. 2016-13.
Operating expenses were $12.81 billion for 2020, 18% higher than 2019, primarily reflecting significantly higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings, higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting improved financial performance) and higher transaction based expenses. Pre-tax
earnings were $8.08 billion for 2020, compared with $3.89 billion for 2019. Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings reduced ROE by 4.0 percentage points for 2020.

Asset Management
We manage client assets across a broad range of investment strategies and asset classes for a diverse set of institutional clients and a network of third-party distributors around the world, including equity, fixed income and alternative investments. We provide investment solutions including those managed on a fiduciary basis by our portfolio managers, as well as those managed by a variety of third-party managers. We offer our investment solutions in a variety of structures, including separately managed accounts, mutual funds, private partnerships and other comingled vehicles. These solutions begin with identifying clients’ objectives and continue through portfolio construction, ongoing asset allocation and risk management and investment realization.
In addition to managing client assets, we invest in alternative investments across a range of asset classes that seek to deliver long-term accretive risk-adjusted returns. Our investing activities, which are typically longer term, include investments in corporate equity, credit, real estate and infrastructure assets.
Asset Management generates revenues from the following:
•
Management and other fees.
The majority of revenues in management and other fees consists
of asset-based fees on client assets that we manage. For further information about AUS, see “Assets Under Supervision” below. The fees that we charge vary by asset class, distribution channel and the types of services provided, and are affected by investment performance, as well as asset inflows and redemptions.
•
Incentive fees.
In certain circumstances, we also receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a fund’s or a separately managed account’s return, or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets. Such fees include overrides, which consist of the increased share of the income and gains derived primarily from our private equity and credit funds when the return on a fund’s investments over the life of the fund exceeds certain threshold returns.
•
Equity investments.
Our alternative investing activities relate to public and private equity investments in corporate, real estate and infrastructure assets. We also make investments through consolidated investment entities (CIEs), substantially all of which are engaged in real estate investment activities.
•
Lending and debt investments.
We invest in corporate debt and provide financing for real estate and other assets. These activities include investments in mezzanine debt, senior debt and distressed debt securities.
The table below presents our Asset Management assets.
The table below presents our Asset Management operating results.
The table below presents our Equity investments net revenues by equity type and asset class.
Operating Environment.
Early in 2020, macroeconomic concerns from the COVID-19
pandemic led to lower global equity prices and wider credit spreads. These trends reversed during the remainder of the year as widespread intervention by central banks and governments globally, combined with improving economic conditions, contributed to a sharp rebound in global equity prices and tighter credit spreads, which provided a more favorable backdrop for asset management activities and investments. If the ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic turn out to be ineffective, it may lead to a decline in asset prices, widening of credit spreads, and investors continuing to transition to asset classes that typically generate lower fees or investors withdrawing their assets, and net revenues in Asset Management would likely be negatively impacted.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
2020 versus 2019.
Net revenues in Asset Management were $7.98 billion for 2020, 11% lower than 2019, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in Equity investments and Lending and debt investments. Incentive fees were significantly higher, and Management and other fees (from our institutional and third-party distribution asset management clients) were higher.
The decrease in Equity investments net revenues reflected significantly lower net gains from investments in private equities, partially offset by significantly higher net gains from investments in public equities. Net gains from investments in private equities for 2020 were primarily driven by company-specific events, such as sales and capital raises, partially offset by net mark-downs driven by corporate performance.
The decrease in Lending and debt investments primarily reflected net losses from debt investments in 2020 compared with net gains in 2019. Lending and debt investments net revenues included approximately $1.05 billion of net interest income for 2020.
The increase in Incentive fees was primarily driven by performance, and the increase in Management and other fees reflected the impact of higher average assets under supervision, partially offset by a lower average effective management fee due to shifts in the mix of client assets and strategies.
Provision for credit losses was $442 million for 2020, 61% higher than 2019, reflecting higher impairments related to the private credit and real estate portfolios and reserve increases as a result of the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on the broader economic environment (incorporating the accounting for credit losses under the CECL standard). See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about ASU No. 2016-13.
Operating expenses were $5.14 billion for 2020, 7% higher than 2019, due to higher compensation and benefits expenses and higher expenses related to consolidated investments, including impairments. Pre-tax
earnings were $2.40 billion for 2020, 38% lower than 2019.
During the year, we sold or announced the sale of over $4 billion of gross equity investments, with a related $2 billion expected reduction in required capital.

Operating Environment.
During 2020, the COVID-19
pandemic initially negatively impacted economic activity and financial markets. In response, central banks and governments globally intervened with widespread monetary and fiscal stimulus to support the economy and financial markets. As a result, global equity prices rebounded sharply and finished the year higher than at the end of 2019. In addition, unemployment and retail spending improved throughout the year after the initial effects of the pandemic. If the ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic turn out to be ineffective, it may lead to a decline in asset prices, investors continuing to favor asset classes that typically generate lower fees, investors withdrawing their assets and consumers withdrawing their deposits or deterioration in consumer credit, and net revenues and the provision for credit losses in Consumer & Wealth Management would likely be negatively impacted.
2020 versus 2019.
Net revenues in Consumer & Wealth Management were $6.00 billion for 2020, 15% higher than 2019.
Net revenues in Wealth management were $4.78 billion, 10% higher than 2019, primarily reflecting higher Management and other fees, primarily reflecting the impact of higher average AUS, higher transaction volumes and the impact of the full-year consolidation of GS Personal Financial Management, partially offset by a lower average effective management fee due to shifts in the mix of client assets and strategies.
Net revenues in Consumer banking were $1.21 billion, 40% higher than 2019, reflecting higher credit card loan and deposit balances.
Provision for credit losses was $758 million for 2020, 79% higher than 2019, reflecting growth in credit card loans and the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on the broader economic environment (incorporating the accounting for credit losses under the CECL standard). See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about ASU No. 2016-13.
Operating expenses were $4.90 billion for 2020, 8% higher than 2019, primarily due to higher expenses related to the impact of the full-year consolidation of GS Personal Financial Management and our credit card activities. Pre-tax
earnings were $337 million for 2020, 43% higher than 2019.
Total client assets (which includes AUS, brokerage assets and consumer deposits) exceeded $1 trillion at the end of 2020.

Assets Under Supervision
AUS includes our institutional clients’ assets and assets sourced through third-party distributors (both included in our Asset Management segment), as well as high-net-worth
clients’ assets (included in our Consumer & Wealth Management segment), where we earn a fee for managing assets on a discretionary basis. This includes net assets in our mutual funds, hedge funds, credit funds, private equity funds, real estate funds, and separately managed accounts for institutional and individual investors. AUS also includes client assets invested with third-party managers, private bank deposits and advisory relationships where we earn a fee for advisory and other services, but do not have investment discretion. AUS does not include the self-directed brokerage assets of our clients.
The table below presents information about our firmwide period-end
AUS by segment, asset class, distribution channel, region and vehicle.
In the table above:
•
Liquidity products includes money market funds and private bank deposits.
•
EMEA represents Europe, Middle East and Africa.
Asset classes, such as alternative investment and equity assets, typically generate higher fees relative to fixed income and liquidity product assets. The average effective management fee (which excludes non-asset-based
fees) we earned on our firmwide assets under supervision was 29 basis points for 2020 and 32 basis points for 2019. This decrease reflected shifts in the mix of client assets and strategies.
We earn management fees on client assets that we manage and also receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a fund’s or a separately managed account’s return, or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets. These incentive fees are recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur. Our estimated unrecognized incentive fees were $1.79 billion as of December 2020 and $1.63 billion as of December 2019. Such amounts are based on the completion of the funds’ financial statements, which is generally one quarter in arrears. These fees will be recognized, assuming no decline in fair value, if and when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur, which is generally when such fees are no longer subject to fluctuations in the market value of the assets.
The table below presents changes in our AUS.
In the table above, total AUS net inflows/(outflows) for 2019 included $71 billion of inflows (substantially all in equity and fixed income assets) in connection with the acquisitions of Standard & Poor’s Investment Advisory Services (SPIAS), GS Personal Financial Management and Rocaton Investment Advisors (Rocaton). SPIAS and Rocaton were included in the Asset Management segment and GS Personal Financial Management was included in the Consumer & Wealth Management segment.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The table below presents information about our average monthly firmwide AUS by segment and asset class.
In addition to our AUS, we have discretion over alternative investments where we currently do not earn management fees (non-fee-earning
alternative assets).
The table below presents information about our AUS for alternative assets, non-fee-earning
alternative assets and total alternative assets.
In the table above:
•
Substantially all corporate equity is private equity.
•
Total alternative assets included uncalled capital that is available for future investing of $44 billion as of December 2020, $32 billion as of December 2019 and $27 billion as of December 2018.
•
Non-fee-earning
alternative assets primarily includes investments that we hold on our balance sheet, our unfunded commitments, unfunded commitments of our clients (where we do not charge fees on commitments), credit facilities collateralized by fund assets and employee funds. Our calculation of non-fee-earning
alternative assets may not be comparable to similar calculations used by other companies.
In the beginning of 2020, we announced a strategic objective of growing our third-party alternatives business, and established targets of achieving net inflows of $100 billion and gross inflows of $150 billion for alternative assets over five years. During 2020, we raised approximately $40 billion in third-party commitments for alternative assets. As of December 2020, approximately $13 billion of these commitments were included in AUS, as they were generating fees. The remaining approximately $27 billion of such commitments were included in non-fee-earning
alternative assets in the table above, approximately $20 billion of which will begin to earn fees (and become AUS), if and when the commitments are drawn and assets are invested.
The table below presents information about alternative investments in our Asset Management segment that we hold on our balance sheet.

Balance Sheet and Funding Sources
Balance Sheet Management
One of our risk management disciplines is our ability to manage the size and composition of our balance sheet. While our asset base changes due to client activity, market fluctuations and business opportunities, the size and composition of our balance sheet also reflects factors, including (i) our overall risk tolerance, (ii) the amount of equity capital we hold and (iii) our funding profile, among other factors. See “Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital - Equity Capital Management” for information about our equity capital management process.
Although our balance sheet fluctuates on a day-to-day
basis, our total assets at quarter-end
and year-end
dates are generally not materially different from those occurring within our reporting periods.
In order to ensure appropriate risk management, we seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid balance sheet and have processes in place to dynamically manage our assets and liabilities, which include (i) balance sheet planning, (ii) balance sheet limits, (iii) monitoring of key metrics and (iv) scenario analyses.
Balance Sheet Planning.
We prepare a balance sheet plan that combines our projected total assets and composition of assets with our expected funding sources over a three-year time horizon. This plan is reviewed quarterly and may be adjusted in response to changing business needs or market conditions. The objectives of this planning process are:
•
To develop our balance sheet projections, taking into account the general state of the financial markets and expected business activity levels, as well as regulatory requirements;
•
To allow Treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions to objectively evaluate balance sheet limit requests from our revenue-producing units in the context of our overall balance sheet constraints, including our liability profile and equity capital levels, and key metrics; and
•
To inform the target amount, tenor and type of funding to raise, based on our projected assets and contractual maturities.
Treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions, along with our revenue-producing units, review current and prior period information and expectations for the year to prepare our balance sheet plan. The specific information reviewed includes asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization, risk and performance measures, and capital usage.
Our consolidated balance sheet plan, including our balance sheets by business, funding projections and projected key metrics, is reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee and the Risk Governance Committee. See “Risk Management - Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for an overview of our risk management structure.
Balance Sheet Limits.
The Firmwide Asset Liability Committee and the Risk Governance Committee have the responsibility to review and approve balance sheet limits. These limits are set at levels which are close to actual operating levels, rather than at levels which reflect our maximum risk appetite, in order to ensure prompt escalation and discussion among our revenue-producing units, Treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions on a routine basis. Requests for changes in limits are evaluated after giving consideration to their impact on our key metrics. Compliance with limits is monitored by our revenue-producing units and Treasury, as well as our independent risk oversight and control functions.
Monitoring of Key Metrics.
We monitor key balance sheet metrics both by business and on a consolidated basis, including asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization and risk measures. We allocate assets to businesses and review and analyze movements resulting from new business activity, as well as market fluctuations.
Scenario Analyses.
We conduct various scenario analyses, including as part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Stress Tests (DFAST), as well as our resolution and recovery planning. See “Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital - Equity Capital Management” for further information about these scenario analyses. These scenarios cover short- and long-term time horizons using various macroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions, based on a range of economic scenarios. We use these analyses to assist us in developing our longer-term balance sheet management strategy, including the level and composition of assets, funding and equity capital. Additionally, these analyses help us develop approaches for maintaining appropriate funding, liquidity and capital across a variety of situations, including a severely stressed environment.

Balance Sheet Analysis and Metrics
As of December 2020, total assets in our consolidated balance sheets were $1.16 trillion, an increase of $170.06 billion from December 2019, primarily reflecting increases in customer and other receivables of $46.73 billion (primarily reflecting higher client activity), trading assets of $38.30 billion (primarily due to increases in derivative instruments reflecting the impact of changes in interest rates and equity prices and increases in non-U.S.
government and agency obligations reflecting our and our clients’ activities), collateralized agreements of $28.46 billion (reflecting the impact of our and our clients’ activities), investments of $24.51 billion (primarily reflecting an increase in U.S. government obligations accounted for as available-for-sale),
and cash and cash equivalents of $22.30 billion (primarily reflecting the impact of our activity). As of December 2020, approximately 25% of our total assets were held in our bank subsidiaries.
As of December 2020, total liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets were $1.07 trillion, an increase of $164.39 billion from December 2019, primarily reflecting increases in deposits of $69.94 billion (reflecting increases in consumer, transaction banking and private bank deposits), trading liabilities of $44.89 billion (primarily due to increases in equities and government obligations reflecting higher client activity and increases in derivative instruments reflecting the impact of changes in interest rate and equity price movements), collateralized financings of $21.93 billion (reflecting the impact of our and our clients’ activities), and customer and other payables of $15.84 billion (primarily reflecting higher client activity).
Our total securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements), accounted for as collateralized financings, were $126.57 billion as of December 2020 and $117.76 billion as of December 2019, which were 24% higher as of December 2020 and 32% higher as of December 2019 than the average daily amount of repurchase agreements over the respective quarters, and 31% higher as of December 2020 and 40% higher as of December 2019 than the average daily amount of repurchase agreements over the respective years. As of December 2020, the increase in our repurchase agreements relative to the average daily amount of repurchase agreements during the quarter and year resulted from higher levels of our and our clients’ activities at the end of the period.
The level of our repurchase agreements fluctuates between and within periods, primarily due to providing clients with access to highly liquid collateral, such as liquid government and agency obligations, through collateralized financing activities.
The table below presents information about our balance sheet and leverage ratios.
In the table above:
•
The leverage ratio equals total assets divided by total shareholders’ equity and measures the proportion of equity and debt we use to finance assets. This ratio is different from the leverage ratios included in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
•
The debt-to-equity
ratio equals unsecured long-term borrowings divided by total shareholders’ equity.
The table below presents information about our shareholders’ equity and book value per common share, including the reconciliation of common shareholders’ equity to tangible common shareholders’ equity.
In the table above:
•
Tangible common shareholders’ equity is calculated as total shareholders’ equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. We believe that tangible common shareholders’ equity is meaningful because it is a measure that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy. Tangible common shareholders’ equity is a non-GAAP
measure and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP
measures used by other companies.
•
Book value per common share and tangible book value per common share are based on common shares outstanding and restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements and not subject to performance conditions (collectively, basic shares) of 358.8 million as of December 2020 and 361.8 million as of December 2019. We believe that tangible book value per common share (tangible common shareholders’ equity divided by basic shares) is meaningful because it is a measure that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy. Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP
measure and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP
measures used by other companies.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Funding Sources
Our primary sources of funding are deposits, collateralized financings, unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, and shareholders’ equity. We seek to maintain broad and diversified funding sources globally across products, programs, markets, currencies and creditors to avoid funding concentrations.
The table below presents information about our funding sources.
Our funding is primarily raised in U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound and Japanese yen. We generally distribute our funding products through our own sales force and third-party distributors to a large, diverse creditor base in a variety of markets in the Americas, Europe and Asia. We believe that our relationships with our creditors are critical to our liquidity. Our creditors include banks, governments, securities lenders, corporations, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds and individuals. We have imposed various internal guidelines to monitor creditor concentration across our funding programs.
Deposits.
Our deposits provide us with a diversified source of funding and reduce our reliance on wholesale funding. We raise deposits, including savings, demand and time deposits, from private bank clients, consumers, transaction banking clients, other institutional clients, and through internal and third-party broker-dealers. Substantially all of our deposits are raised through GS Bank USA and GSIB. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our deposits.
Secured Funding.
We fund a significant amount of inventory and a portion of investments on a secured basis. Secured funding includes collateralized financings in the consolidated balance sheets. We may also pledge our inventory and investments as collateral for securities borrowed under a securities lending agreement. We also use our own inventory and investments to cover transactions in which we or our clients have sold securities that have not yet been purchased. Secured funding is less sensitive to changes in our credit quality than unsecured funding, due to our posting of collateral to our lenders. Nonetheless, we analyze the refinancing risk of our secured funding activities, taking into account trade tenors, maturity profiles, counterparty concentrations, collateral eligibility and counterparty rollover probabilities. We seek to mitigate our refinancing risk by executing term trades with staggered maturities, diversifying counterparties, raising excess secured funding and pre-funding
residual risk through our GCLA.
We seek to raise secured funding with a term appropriate for the liquidity of the assets that are being financed, and we seek longer maturities for secured funding collateralized by asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis, especially during times of market stress. Our secured funding, excluding funding collateralized by liquid government and agency obligations, is primarily executed for tenors of one month or greater and is primarily executed through term repurchase agreements and securities loaned contracts.
The weighted average maturity of our secured funding included in collateralized financings in the consolidated balance sheets, excluding funding that can only be collateralized by liquid government and agency obligations,
exceeded 120 days as of December 2020.
Assets that may be harder to fund on a secured basis during times of market stress include certain financial instruments in the following categories: mortgage and other asset-backed loans and securities, non-investment-grade
corporate debt securities, equity securities and emerging market securities. Assets that are classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are generally funded on an unsecured basis. See Notes 4 through 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the classification of financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy and “Unsecured Long-Term Borrowings” below for further information about the use of unsecured long-term borrowings as a source of funding.
We also raise financing through other types of collateralized financings, such as secured loans and notes. GS Bank USA has access to funding from the Federal Home Loan Bank. We had no outstanding borrowings against the Federal Home Loan Bank as of December 2020 and $527 million as of December 2019. Additionally, we have access to funding through the Federal Reserve discount window. However, we do not rely on this funding in our liquidity planning and stress testing.
Unsecured Short-Term Borrowings.
A significant portion of our unsecured short-term borrowings was originally long-term debt that is scheduled to mature within one year of the reporting date. We use unsecured short-term borrowings, including U.S. and non-U.S.
hybrid financial instruments and commercial paper, to finance liquid assets and for other cash management purposes. In accordance with regulatory requirements, Group Inc. does not issue debt with an original maturity of less than one year, other than to its subsidiaries. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured short-term borrowings.
Goldman Sachs 2020 Form 10-K
THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Unsecured Long-Term Borrowings.
Unsecured long-term borrowings, including structured notes, are raised through syndicated U.S. registered offerings, U.S. registered and Rule 144A medium-term note programs, offshore medium-term note offerings and other debt offerings. We issue in different tenors, currencies and products to maximize the diversification of our investor base.
The table below presents our quarterly unsecured long-term borrowings maturity profile.
The weighted average maturity of our unsecured long-term borrowings as of December 2020 was approximately seven years. To mitigate refinancing risk, we seek to limit the principal amount of debt maturing over the course of any monthly, quarterly or annual time horizon. We enter into interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our unsecured long-term borrowings into floating-rate obligations to manage our exposure to interest rates. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured long-term borrowings.
Shareholders’ Equity.
Shareholders’ equity is a stable and perpetual source of funding. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our shareholders’ equity.
Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital
Capital adequacy is of critical importance to us. We have in place a comprehensive capital management policy that provides a framework, defines objectives and establishes guidelines to assist us in maintaining the appropriate level and composition of capital in both business-as-usual
and stressed conditions.
Equity Capital Management
We determine the appropriate amount and composition of our equity capital by considering multiple factors, including our current and future regulatory capital requirements, the results of our capital planning and stress testing process, the results of resolution capital models and other factors, such as rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment and conditions in the financial markets.
We manage our capital requirements and the levels of our capital usage principally by setting limits on the balance sheet and/or limits on risk, in each case at both the firmwide and business levels.
We principally manage the level and composition of our equity capital through issuances and repurchases of our common stock.
We may issue, redeem or repurchase our preferred stock, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts, and other subordinated debt or other forms of capital as business conditions warrant. Prior to such redemptions or repurchases, we must receive approval from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). See Notes 14 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our preferred stock, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts and other subordinated debt.
Capital Planning and Stress Testing Process.
As part of capital planning, we project sources and uses of capital given a range of business environments, including stressed conditions. Our stress testing process is designed to identify and measure material risks associated with our business activities, including market risk, credit risk and operational risk, as well as our ability to generate revenues.
Our capital planning process incorporates an internal capital adequacy assessment with the objective of ensuring that we are appropriately capitalized relative to the risks in our businesses. We incorporate stress scenarios into our capital planning process with a goal of holding sufficient capital to ensure we remain adequately capitalized after experiencing a severe stress event. Our assessment of capital adequacy is viewed in tandem with our assessment of liquidity adequacy and is integrated into our overall risk management structure, governance and policy framework.
Our stress tests incorporate our internally designed stress scenarios, including our internally developed severely adverse scenario, and those required by the FRB, and are designed to capture our specific vulnerabilities and risks. We provide further information about our stress test processes and a summary of the results on our website as described in “Business - Available Information” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.
As required by the FRB’s CCAR rules, we submit an annual capital plan for review by the FRB. The purpose of the FRB’s review is to ensure that we have a robust, forward-looking capital planning process that accounts for our unique risks and that permits continued operation during times of economic and financial stress.
Goldman Sachs 2020 Form 10-K
THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The FRB evaluates us based, in part, on whether we have the capital necessary to continue operating under the baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB and those developed internally. This evaluation also takes into account our process for identifying risk, our controls and governance for capital planning, and our guidelines for making capital planning decisions. In addition, the FRB evaluates our plan to make capital distributions (i.e., dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions of stock, subordinated debt or other capital securities) and issue capital, across the range of macroeconomic scenarios and firm-specific assumptions. The FRB determines the stress capital buffer (SCB) applicable to us based on its own annual stress test. The SCB under the Standardized approach is calculated as (i) the difference between our starting and minimum projected CET1 capital ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario and (ii) our planned common stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon, expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets (RWAs).
We submitted our 2020 CCAR capital plan in April 2020 and published a summary of our annual DFAST results in June 2020. See “Business - Available Information” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.
With respect to our 2020 CCAR submission, the FRB notified us that our SCB beginning on October 1, 2020 is 6.6%, bringing our Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement to 13.6%. In light of the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on the economy, the FRB required all large bank holding companies (BHCs) to suspend stock repurchases through the fourth quarter of 2020 and not to increase common stock dividends or pay common stock dividends in excess of their average net income over the prior four quarters. The FRB also required large BHCs, including us, to resubmit their capital plans in November 2020 under the updated scenarios provided by the FRB, and released the results of the resubmissions in December 2020.
The FRB did not change our SCB as a result of our resubmission, but has extended the period to recalculate it to March 31, 2021. The FRB also modified the existing restrictions on capital actions by permitting stock repurchases and common stock dividends, that in aggregate, do not exceed the average net income over the prior four quarters and requiring large BHCs to not increase their common stock dividend in the first quarter of 2021. We plan to maintain both common and preferred dividends, and resumed common stock repurchases in the first quarter of 2021, while complying with these capital restrictions. In addition, we will continue deploying capital to our businesses where returns are accretive and otherwise return it to our shareholders as permitted by the FRB.
GS Bank USA has its own capital planning process, but was not required to submit its annual stress test results to the FRB in 2020. Based on growth in GS Bank USA’s average balance sheet, it will be required to submit its annual stress test results in 2022. Goldman Sachs International (GSI), GSIB and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE) also have their own capital planning and stress testing process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the guidelines of their respective regulators.
Contingency Capital Plan.
As part of our comprehensive capital management policy, we maintain a contingency capital plan. Our contingency capital plan provides a framework for analyzing and responding to a perceived or actual capital deficiency, including, but not limited to, identification of drivers of a capital deficiency, as well as mitigants and potential actions. It outlines the appropriate communication procedures to follow during a crisis period, including internal dissemination of information, as well as timely communication with external stakeholders.
Capital Attribution.
We assess each of our businesses’ capital usage based on our internal assessment of risks, which incorporates an attribution of our relevant regulatory capital requirements. These regulatory capital requirements are allocated using our attributed equity framework, which takes into consideration our most binding capital constraints. Our most binding capital constraint is based on the results of the FRB’s annual stress test, which includes the Standardized risk-based capital and leverage ratios. See “Segment Assets and Operating Results - Segment Operating Results” for information about our attributed equity by segment. Effective on January 1, 2021, we adjusted the attributed equity framework in line with the impact of the SCB Rule and our SCB of 6.6%, which became effective on October 1, 2020 under the Standardized approach.
Share Repurchase Program.
We use our share repurchase program to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity. The repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open-market purchases (which may include repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1
and accelerated share repurchases), the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by our current and projected capital position and our capital plan submitted to the FRB as part of CCAR. The amounts and timing of the repurchases may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of our common stock.
Goldman Sachs 2020 Form 10-K
THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
As of December 2020, the remaining share authorization under our existing repurchase program was 49.7 million shares. See “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” in Part II, Item 5 of this Form 10-K
and Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our share repurchase program, and see above for information about our capital planning and stress testing process.
Resolution Capital Models.
In connection with our resolution planning efforts, we have established a Resolution Capital Adequacy and Positioning framework, which is designed to ensure that our major subsidiaries (GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (GS&Co.), GSI, GSIB, Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL), Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P., Goldman Sachs Asset Management International (GSAMI) and GSBE) have access to sufficient loss-absorbing capacity (in the form of equity, subordinated debt and unsecured senior debt) so that they are able to wind-down following a Group Inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy.
In addition, we have established a triggers and alerts framework, which is designed to provide the Board of Directors of Group Inc. (Board) with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc.
Rating Agency Guidelines
The credit rating agencies assign credit ratings to the obligations of Group Inc., which directly issues or guarantees substantially all of our senior unsecured debt obligations. GS&Co. and GSI have been assigned long- and short-term issuer ratings by certain credit rating agencies. GS Bank USA, GSIB and GSBE have also been assigned long- and short-term issuer ratings, as well as ratings on their long- and short-term bank deposits. In addition, credit rating agencies have assigned ratings to debt obligations of certain other subsidiaries of Group Inc.
The level and composition of our equity capital are among the many factors considered in determining our credit ratings. Each agency has its own definition of eligible capital and methodology for evaluating capital adequacy, and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors rather than a single calculation. See “Risk Management - Liquidity Risk Management - Credit Ratings” for further information about credit ratings of Group Inc., GS Bank USA, GSIB, GSBE, GS&Co. and GSI.
Consolidated Regulatory Capital
We are subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements which are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). Under the Capital Framework, we are an “Advanced approach” banking organization and have been designated as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB).
The capital requirements calculated under the Capital Framework include the capital conservation buffer requirements, comprised of a 2.5% buffer (under the Advanced Capital Rules), a stress capital buffer (under the Standardized Capital Rules), and a countercyclical buffer and the G-SIB
surcharge (under both Capital Rules). Our G-SIB
surcharge is 2.5% for 2020, 2021 and 2022. We expect that our G-SIB
surcharge will be 3.0% beginning in 2023. The G-SIB
surcharge and countercyclical buffer in the future may differ due to additional guidance from our regulators and/or positional changes, and our SCB is likely to change from year to year based on the results of the annual supervisory stress tests. Our target Standardized CET1 capital ratio over the medium term is between 13.0% and 13.5% (including management buffers) based upon the execution of our previously announced strategic initiatives and achievement of capital efficiencies.
See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios, and the Capital Framework.
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)
We are also subject to the FRB’s TLAC and related requirements. Failure to comply with the TLAC and related requirements could result in restrictions being imposed by the FRB and could limit our ability to repurchase shares, pay dividends and make certain discretionary compensation payments.
The table below presents TLAC and external long-term debt requirements.
In the table above:
•
The TLAC to RWAs requirement includes (i) the 18% minimum, (ii) the 2.5% buffer, (iii) the 1.5% G-SIB
surcharge (Method 1) and (iv) the countercyclical capital buffer, which the FRB has set to zero percent.
•
The TLAC to leverage exposure requirement includes (i) the 7.5% minimum and (ii) the 2.0% leverage exposure buffer.
•
The external long-term debt to RWAs requirement includes (i) the 6% minimum and (ii) the 2.5% G-SIB
surcharge (Method 2).
Goldman Sachs 2020 Form 10-K
THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
•
The external long-term debt to total leverage exposure is the 4.5% minimum.
The table below presents information about our TLAC and external long-term debt ratios.
In the table above:
•
TLAC includes common and preferred stock, and eligible long-term debt issued by Group Inc. Eligible long-term debt represents unsecured debt, which has a remaining maturity of at least one year and satisfies additional requirements.
•
External long-term debt consists of eligible long-term debt subject to a haircut if it is due to be paid between one and two years.
•
RWAs represent Advanced RWAs as of December 2020 and Standardized RWAs as of December 2019. In accordance with the TLAC rules, the higher of Advanced or Standardized RWAs are used in the calculation of TLAC and external long-term debt ratios and applicable requirements.
•
Leverage exposure consists of average adjusted total assets and certain off-balance
sheet exposures. As of December 2020, leverage exposure excluded average holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and average deposits at the Federal Reserve
as permitted by the FRB under a temporary amendment. This temporary amendment is effective through March 31, 2021.
See “Business - Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K
for further information about TLAC.
Subsidiary Capital Requirements
Many of our subsidiaries, including our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to separate regulation and capital requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate.
Bank Subsidiaries.
GS Bank USA is our primary U.S. banking subsidiary and GSIB and GSBE are our primary non-U.S.
banking subsidiaries. These entities are subject to regulatory capital requirements. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the regulatory capital requirements of our bank subsidiaries.
U.S. Regulated Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries.
GS&Co. is our primary U.S. regulated broker-dealer subsidiary and is subject to regulatory capital requirements, including those imposed by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. In addition, GS&Co. is a registered futures commission merchant and is subject to regulatory capital requirements imposed by the CFTC, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the National Futures Association. Rule 15c3-1
of the SEC and Rule 1.17 of the CFTC specify uniform minimum net capital requirements, as defined, for their registrants, and also effectively require that a significant part of the registrants’ assets be kept in relatively liquid form. GS&Co. has elected to calculate its minimum capital requirements in accordance with the “Alternative Net Capital Requirement” as permitted by Rule 15c3-1.
GS&Co. had regulatory net capital, as defined by Rule 15c3-1,
of $22.38 billion as of December 2020 and $20.88 billion as of December 2019, which exceeded the amount required by $18.45 billion as of December 2020 and $18.15 billion as of December 2019. In addition to its alternative minimum net capital requirements, GS&Co. is also required to hold tentative net capital in excess of $1 billion and net capital in excess of $500 million in accordance with the market and credit risk standards of Appendix E of Rule 15c3-1.
GS&Co. is also required to notify the SEC in the event that its tentative net capital is less than $5 billion. As of both December 2020 and December 2019, GS&Co. had tentative net capital and net capital in excess of both the minimum and the notification requirements.
Non-U.S.
Regulated Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries.
Our principal non-U.S.
regulated broker-dealer subsidiaries include GSI and GSJCL.
GSI, our U.K. broker-dealer, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
GSI is subject to the capital framework for E.U.-regulated financial institutions prescribed in the E.U. Fourth Capital Requirements Directive and the E.U. Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). These capital regulations are largely based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (Basel Committee) capital framework for strengthening international capital standards (Basel III).
The table below presents GSI’s risk-based capital requirements.
In the table above, the risk-based capital requirements incorporate capital guidance received from the PRA and could change in the future.
Goldman Sachs 2020 Form 10-K
THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The table below presents information about GSI’s risk-based capital ratios.
In the table above, CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital as of December 2020 excluded GSI’s undistributed profits from October 2020 through December 2020, as such profits have not yet been approved to be included as regulatory capital by the PRA.
In June 2019, the European Commission finalized an amendment to the CRR that establishes a 3% leverage ratio requirement for certain E.U. financial institutions. This leverage ratio compares the CRR’s definition of Tier 1 capital to a measure of leverage exposure, defined as the sum of certain assets plus certain off-balance
sheet exposures (which include a measure of derivatives, securities financing transactions, commitments and guarantees), less Tier 1 capital deductions. Following Brexit, GSI will become subject to a similar PRA-required
leverage ratio that is expected to become effective in January 2022. GSI had a leverage ratio of 4.6% as of both December 2020 and December 2019. GSI’s leverage ratio as of December 2020 excluded GSI’s undistributed profits from October 2020 through December 2020, as such profits have not yet been approved to be included as regulatory capital by the PRA. This leverage ratio is based on our current interpretation and understanding of this rule and may evolve as we discuss the interpretation and application of this rule with GSI’s regulators.
GSI is also subject to a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities issued to affiliates. This requirement is subject to a transitional period which began to phase in from January 2019 and will become fully effective beginning in January 2022. As of December 2020, GSI was in compliance with this requirement.
GSJCL, our Japanese broker-dealer, is regulated by Japan’s Financial Services Agency. GSJCL and certain other non-U.S.
subsidiaries are also subject to capital requirements promulgated by authorities of the countries in which they operate. As of both December 2020 and December 2019, these subsidiaries were in compliance with their local capital requirements.
Regulatory and Other Matters
Regulatory Matters
Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and supervision worldwide. Regulations have been adopted or are being considered by regulators and policy makers worldwide. Given that many of the new and proposed rules are highly complex, the full impact of regulatory reform will not be known until the rules are implemented and market practices develop under the final regulations.
See “Business - Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K
for further information about the laws, rules and regulations and proposed laws, rules and regulations that apply to us and our operations.
Other Matters
Brexit.
The E.U. and the U.K. agreed to a withdrawal agreement (the Withdrawal Agreement), which became effective on January 31, 2020. The transition period under the Withdrawal Agreement ended on December 2020, after which E.U. law ceased to apply to the U.K. Effective December 31, 2020, and notwithstanding the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the E.U. and U.K. reached at the end of 2020, firms established in the U.K., including our U.K. subsidiaries, have lost their pan-E.U.
“passports” and are generally treated as any other entities in countries outside the E.U. whose access to the E.U. is governed by the E.U. and national law.
The U.K. has adopted E.U. financial services legislation that was in effect on December 31, 2020, which means that the U.K. financial services regime will remain substantially the same as under E.U. financial services legislation. However, in the future the U.K. may diverge from E.U. legislation and may decide not to adopt rules that correspond to E.U. legislation not already operative in the U.K.
We had prepared for a scenario where the U.K. financial services firms lost access to E.U. markets. Accordingly, we have managed to continue servicing our E.U. client base in the following manner:
•
Our German bank subsidiary, GSBE, acts as our main operating subsidiary in the E.U. and has assumed certain functions that can no longer be efficiently and effectively performed by our U.K. operating subsidiaries, including GSI, GSIB and GSAMI.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
•
We have moved a number of relationships with clients of our Investment Banking, Global Markets and Wealth Management businesses from GSI and GSIB to GSBE, and clients of our Asset Management business from GSAMI to GSBE. A meaningful portion of our Global Markets and Investment Banking clients may choose to continue being serviced by, and to transact with, our U.K. entities under arrangements provided by individual member states. We expect to continue providing products and services in this manner to the extent that clients prefer such coverage and it is available. We have received applicable cross-border licenses and exemptions for GSI where these are available. We have also set up authorized branches of GSI in the E.U. which will be used for our Global Markets business with domestic clients in France, Spain and Sweden.
•
We have set up branches of GSBE in a number of jurisdictions in the E.U. to enable Investment Banking, Global Markets and Consumer & Wealth Management personnel to be situated in our offices in those countries.
•
We intend to use Goldman Sachs Paris Inc. et Cie as our primary broker-dealer entity for E.U. clients primarily to conduct certain activities that GSBE may be prevented from undertaking, such as activities related to physical commodities and related products.
•
The internal infrastructure build-out
and external connectivity to financial market infrastructure required for our new E.U. entities is complete. GSBE is connected and operational with E.U. exchange, clearing and settlement platforms.
•
In order to service our Asset Management clients, we have received approval from the Irish Financial Regulator, the Central Bank of Ireland, for a Collective Investment Fund and Alternative Investment Fund Manager in Ireland, which has replaced the similar existing London-based Alternative Investment Fund Manager.
Replacement of Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs), including LIBOR.
Central banks and regulators in a number of major jurisdictions (for example, U.S., U.K., E.U., Switzerland and Japan) have convened working groups to find, and implement the transition to suitable replacements for IBORs. The administrator of LIBOR has proposed to extend the publication of the most commonly used U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings to June 30, 2023 and to cease publishing other LIBOR settings on December 31, 2021. The U.S. federal banking agencies have issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using the U.S. Dollar LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021.
Market-led
working groups in major jurisdictions, noted above, have already selected their preferred alternative risk-free reference rates. They have published and are expected to continue to publish consultations on issues, including methodologies for fallback provisions in contracts and financial instruments linked to IBORs and the development of term structures for alternative risk-free reference rates, which will be critical for financial markets to transition to the use of alternative risk-free reference rates in place of IBORs.
In October 2020, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) launched the IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, which became effective in January 2021 and provides derivatives market participants with new fallbacks for legacy and new derivatives contracts. Both counterparties will have to adhere to the Fallbacks Protocol or engage in bilateral amendments for the terms to be effective for derivative contracts. We have adhered to the Fallbacks Protocol for our eligible derivative contracts.
We are facilitating an orderly transition from IBORs to alternative risk-free reference rates for us and our clients. Our centralized LIBOR transition program continues to make progress with a focus on:
•
Evaluating and monitoring the impacts across our businesses, including transactions and products;
•
Ensuring that financial instruments and contracts impacted by the transition already contain appropriate fallback language or are being amended, either through bilateral negotiation or using industry-wide tools, such as protocols;
•
Enhancements to infrastructure (for example, models and systems) to prepare for a smooth transition to alternative risk-free reference rates;
•
Ensuring operational readiness to offer and support various alternative risk-free reference rate products;
•
Active participation in central bank and sector working groups, including responding to industry consultations; and
•
Client education and communication.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
As part of this program, we have sought to systematically identify the risks inherent in this transition, including financial risks (for example, earnings volatility under stress due to widening swap spreads and the loss of funding sources as a result of counterparties’ reluctance to participate in transitioning their positions) and nonfinancial risks (for example, the inability to negotiate fallbacks with clients and/or counterparties, the potential for disputes relating to the interpretation and implementation of fallback provision and operational impediments to the transition).
The markets for alternative risk-free reference rates continue to develop and, where liquidity allows, we have begun participating in alternative risk-free reference rate markets. In particular, during 2020 we have:
•
Issued debt and deposits linked to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA).
•
Executed SOFR- and SONIA-based derivative contracts to make markets and facilitate client activities.
•
Executed transactions in the market to reduce our LIBOR exposures arising from hedges to our fixed-rate debt issuances and replace with alternative risk-free reference rate exposures.
In addition, in 2020, we, alongside the industry, successfully transitioned the discounting conventions of centrally cleared Euro interest rate derivatives from the Euro Overnight Index Average to the Euro Short-Term Rate and centrally cleared U.S. Dollar interest rate derivatives from Federal Funds to SOFR at Chicago Mercantile Exchange, London Clearing House and Eurex Exchange.
We are engaged with a range of industry and regulatory working groups (for example, ISDA, the Bank of England’s Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates, the Federal Reserve’s Alternative Reference Rates Committee and the Canadian Alternative Reference Rate Working Group) and will continue to engage with our clients and counterparties to facilitate an orderly transition to alternative risk-free reference rates.
Impact of COVID-19
Pandemic.
The resurgence in the spread of COVID-19
toward the end of 2020 and into 2021 has created greater uncertainty regarding the economic outlook for the near term, even as early efforts to distribute vaccines are underway. While governments and central banks continued to be aggressive in providing fiscal and monetary stimulus, the global economic recovery remains fragile.
We have continued to successfully execute on our Business Continuity Planning (BCP) strategy since initially activating it in the first quarter of 2020 in response to the emergence of the COVID-19
pandemic. Our priority has been to safeguard our employees and to seek to ensure continuity of business operations on behalf of our clients. Our business continuity response to the COVID-19
pandemic is managed by a central team, which is led by our chief administrative officer and chief medical officer, and includes senior management within Risk and the chief operating officers across all regions and businesses. As a result of our BCP strategy, the majority of our employees worked remotely during most of 2020 and continue to do so in January 2021. In order to re-open
our offices to employees after initial restrictions began to ease in the second quarter of 2020, we established policies and protocols to address safety considerations, taking into account the readiness of people, communities and facilities. Over the course of the pandemic, the extent to which our employees have worked from our offices has varied based on how circumstances in each location have evolved. We are in constant dialogue with key stakeholders to assess health and safety conditions across all of our office locations and to have robust procedures in place to protect the well-being of employees, such as controls around building access, strict physical distancing measures, enhanced cleaning regimes and on-site
COVID-19
testing.
Our systems and infrastructure have been robust throughout the COVID-19
pandemic, enabling us to conduct our activities without disruption. We continue to maintain regular and active communication among our senior management, the rest of our employees and the Board, and our decision-making processes have remained disciplined and rigorous throughout the pandemic. Since the beginning of the COVID-19
pandemic, our Management Committee and other senior leaders have met regularly and our executive officers have provided regular and enhanced communications to promote connectivity with our clients and employees worldwide. In addition, as part of our vendor management processes, we have ongoing dialogues with third-party service providers, which are intended to ensure that they continue to meet our criteria for business continuity.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Our liquidity position during 2020 remained strong, as our GCLA averaged $283 billion for the year. We have continued to access our traditional funding sources in the normal course and service our debt and other obligations on a timely basis. Our CET1 capital ratios under the Standardized approach increased to 14.7% as of December 2020, up 140 basis points compared with December 2019, as we continued to support our clients, while managing our capital. We suspended stock repurchases during the first quarter of 2020 and, consistent with the FRB’s requirement for all large BHCs, extended the suspension of stock repurchases through the fourth quarter of 2020. We resumed stock repurchases in the first quarter of 2021. See “Balance Sheet and Funding Sources,” “Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital” and “Liquidity Risk Management” for further information.
As a result of the COVID-19
pandemic, we have had to apply a greater degree of judgment in making certain accounting estimates and assumptions. The process of estimating the allowance for credit losses is inherently judgmental in nature, given that it involves forecasts of future economic conditions. The uncertainty as to the severity and duration of the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic has made this process more challenging, as it has resulted in greater subjectivity in our economic forecasts. This uncertainty also impacts the estimation of the fair value for less liquid financial instruments that lack price transparency, where valuation involves judgment regarding estimated future cash flows or other significant unobservable inputs. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our allowance for credit losses and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about fair value measurements. In addition, we assessed goodwill for impairment as of December 2020 and determined that it was not impaired. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill.
The COVID-19
pandemic gave rise to higher volatility levels in financial markets and correspondingly higher client activity levels. We have assisted clients in navigating the unpredictable and unprecedented operating environment by providing complex risk intermediation, financing solutions and bespoke advice, utilizing our balance sheet, as necessary. Our average daily Value-at-Risk
(VaR) for 2020 was $94 million, $38 million higher than 2019. We have maintained our proactive approach to managing market risk levels, which entails ongoing review and monitoring of exposures and focusing on ways to mitigate risk. With respect to credit risk, the improvement in economic conditions in the second half of 2020 from the significant contraction in the second quarter of 2020 has, in general, helped to stabilize conditions in the credit markets. In relationship lending, the drawn balance on credit lines, which spiked early in the pandemic, was back to pre-pandemic
levels as of December 2020. While borrowers, in general, faced less challenging circumstances in the second half of the year, credit risk remains high for borrowers in industries that continue to face significant disruptions due to the COVID-19
pandemic, such as companies in the oil and gas, gaming and lodging, and airlines industries. Throughout this crisis, we have remained highly focused on monitoring of credit exposures and management of margin calls and disputes. Our risk positions remained balanced, controlled and adequately provisioned for, both in terms of counterparty risk and sector exposure. See “Market Risk Management” and “Credit Risk Management” for further information.
Our actions in response to the COVID-19
pandemic have included granting forbearance to certain corporate and other borrowers who have made requests to defer payments. We had approximately $880 million of corporate loans and approximately $155 million of commercial real estate loans under forbearance as of December 2020. We have continued to provide relief to consumers through programs to help them manage the financial challenges that they face as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic. The accommodations under these programs include providing borrowers of installment and credit card loans the ability to modify or defer payments without incurring interest charges and permitting Marcus depositors to access certificates of deposit early without a penalty. As of December 2020, installment and credit card loans with a gross carrying value of approximately $120 million were enrolled in such programs. In aggregate, loans under forbearance or relief programs represented approximately 1% of total loans.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The unpredictability of the trajectory of the COVID-19
pandemic has significantly diminished visibility into the future operating environment. A sustained period of weak economic conditions as a result of the pandemic would be detrimental to our businesses as it would negatively affect factors that are important to our operating performance, such as the level of client activity, creditworthiness of counterparties and borrowers, and the amount of our AUS. We are monitoring the ongoing developments as the COVID-19
vaccines are being distributed and administered, and will take further action that are in the best interests of our employees, clients and counterparties. For further information about the risks associated with the COVID-19
pandemic, see “Business - Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
In the ordinary course of business, we enter into various types of off-balance
sheet arrangements. Our involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including:
•
Purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in special purpose entities, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization vehicles;
•
Holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships, and preferred and common stock in other nonconsolidated vehicles;
•
Entering into interest rate, foreign currency, equity, commodity and credit derivatives, including total return swaps; and
•
Providing guarantees, indemnifications, commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties.
We enter into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes, including securitizations. The securitization vehicles that purchase mortgages, corporate bonds, and other types of financial assets are critical to the functioning of several significant investor markets, including the mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities markets, since they offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process.
We also enter into these arrangements to underwrite client securitization transactions; provide secondary market liquidity; make investments in performing and nonperforming debt, distressed loans, power-related assets, equity securities, real estate and other assets; provide investors with credit-linked and asset-repackaged notes; and receive or provide letters of credit to satisfy margin requirements and to facilitate the clearance and settlement process.

•
As of December 2020, unsecured long-term borrowings had maturities extending through 2065, consisted principally of senior borrowings, and included $12.04 billion of adjustments to the carrying value of certain unsecured long-term borrowings resulting from the application of hedge accounting. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured long-term borrowings.
•
As of December 2020, the difference between aggregate contractual principal amount and the related fair value of long-term other secured financings for which the fair value option was elected was not material.
•
As of December 2020, the fair value of unsecured long-term borrowings for which the fair value option was elected, exceeded the aggregate contractual principal amount by $445 million.
•
Interest payments represents estimated future contractual interest payments related to unsecured long-term borrowings, secured long-term financings and time deposits based on applicable interest rates as of December 2020, and includes stated coupons, if any, on structured notes.

Operating lease payments includes lease commitments for office space that expire on various dates through 2069. Certain agreements are subject to periodic escalation provisions for increases in real estate taxes and other charges. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our operating lease liabilities.
Risk Management
Risks are inherent in our businesses and include liquidity, market, credit, operational, model, legal, compliance, conduct, regulatory and reputational risks. Our risks include the risks across our risk categories, regions or global businesses, as well as those which have uncertain outcomes and have the potential to materially impact our financial results, our liquidity and our reputation. For further information about our risk management processes, see “Overview and Structure of Risk Management,” and for information about our areas of risk, see “Liquidity Risk Management,” “Market Risk Management,” “Credit Risk Management,” “Operational Risk Management” and “Model Risk Management” and “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Overview and Structure of Risk Management
Overview
We believe that effective risk management is critical to our success. Accordingly, we have established an enterprise risk management framework that employs a comprehensive, integrated approach to risk management, and is designed to enable comprehensive risk management processes through which we identify, assess, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our activities. Our risk management structure is built around three core components: governance, processes and people.
Governance.
Risk management governance starts with the Board, which both directly and through its committees, including its Risk Committee, oversees our risk management policies and practices implemented through the enterprise risk management framework. The Board is also responsible for the annual review and approval of our risk appetite statement. The risk appetite statement describes the levels and types of risk we are willing to accept or to avoid, in order to achieve our objectives included in our strategic business plan, while remaining in compliance with regulatory requirements. The Board reviews our strategic business plan and is ultimately responsible for overseeing and providing direction about our strategy and risk appetite.
Goldman Sachs 2020 Form 10-K
THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The Board receives regular briefings on firmwide risks, including liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk, operational risk and model risk from our independent risk oversight and control functions, including the chief risk officer, and on compliance risk and conduct risk from Compliance, on legal and regulatory enforcement matters from the general counsel, and on other matters impacting our reputation from the chair of our Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee and our Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee. The chief risk officer reports to our chief executive officer and to the Risk Committee of the Board. As part of the review of the firmwide risk portfolio, the chief risk officer regularly advises the Risk Committee of the Board of relevant risk metrics and material exposures, including risk limits and thresholds established in our risk appetite statement.
The implementation of our risk governance structure and core risk management processes are overseen by Enterprise Risk, which reports to our chief risk officer, and is responsible for ensuring that our enterprise risk management framework provides the Board, our risk committees and senior management with a consistent and integrated approach to managing our various risks in a manner consistent with our risk appetite.
Our revenue-producing units, as well as Treasury, Engineering, Human Capital Management, Operations, and Corporate and Workplace Solutions, are considered our first line of defense. They are accountable for the outcomes of our risk-generating activities, as well as for assessing and managing those risks within our risk appetite.
Our independent risk oversight and control functions are considered our second line of defense and provide independent assessment, oversight and challenge of the risks taken by our first line of defense, as well as lead and participate in risk committees. Independent risk oversight and control functions include Compliance, Conflicts Resolution, Controllers, Legal, Risk and Tax.
Internal Audit is considered our third line of defense and reports to the Audit Committee of the Board and administratively to our chief executive officer. Internal Audit includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience, including risk management expertise. Internal Audit is responsible for independently assessing and validating the effectiveness of key controls, including those within the risk management framework, and providing timely reporting to the Audit Committee of the Board, senior management and regulators.
The three lines of defense structure promotes the accountability of first line risk takers, provides a framework for effective challenge by the second line and empowers independent review from the third line.
Processes.
We maintain various processes that are critical components of our risk management framework, including (i) risk identification and assessment, (ii) risk appetite, limit and threshold setting, (iii) risk reporting and monitoring, and (iv) risk decision-making.
•
Risk Identification and Assessment.
We believe that the identification and assessment of our risks is a critical step in providing our Board and senior management transparency and insight into the range and materiality of our risks. We have a comprehensive data collection process, including firmwide policies and procedures that require all employees to report and escalate risk events. Our approach for risk identification and assessment is comprehensive across all risk types, is dynamic and forward-looking to reflect and adapt to our changing risk profile and business environment, leverages subject matter expertise, and allows for prioritization of our most critical risks.
To effectively assess our risks, we maintain a daily discipline of marking substantially all of our inventory to current market levels. We carry our inventory at fair value, with changes in valuation reflected immediately in our risk management systems and in net revenues. We do so because we believe this discipline is one of the most effective tools for assessing and managing risk and that it provides transparent and realistic insight into our inventory exposures.
An important part of our risk management process is firmwide stress testing. It allows us to quantify our exposure to tail risks, highlight potential loss concentrations, undertake risk/reward analysis, and assess and mitigate our risk positions. Firmwide stress tests are performed on a regular basis and are designed to ensure a comprehensive analysis of our vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks combining financial and nonfinancial risks, including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity and funding, operational and compliance, strategic, systemic and emerging risks into a single combined scenario. We also perform ad hoc stress tests in anticipation of market events or conditions. Stress tests are also used to assess capital adequacy as part of our capital planning and stress testing process. See “Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital - Equity Capital Management” for further information.
Goldman Sachs 2020 Form 10-K
THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
•
Risk Appetite, Limit and Threshold Setting.
We apply a rigorous framework of limits and thresholds to control and monitor risk across transactions, products, businesses and markets. The Board, directly or indirectly through its Risk Committee, approves limits and thresholds included in our risk appetite statement at firmwide, business and product levels. In addition, the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee is responsible for approving our risk limits framework, subject to the overall limits approved by the Risk Committee of the Board, and monitoring these limits.
The Risk Governance Committee is responsible for approving limits at firmwide, business and product levels. Certain limits may be set at levels that will require periodic adjustment, rather than at levels that reflect our maximum risk appetite. This fosters an ongoing dialogue about risk among our first and second lines of defense, committees and senior management, as well as rapid escalation of risk-related
matters. Additionally, through delegated authority from the Risk Governance Committee, Market Risk sets limits at certain product and desk levels, and Credit Risk sets limits for individual counterparties, counterparties and their subsidiaries, industries and countries. Limits are reviewed regularly and amended on a permanent or temporary basis to reflect changing market conditions, business conditions or risk tolerance.
•
Risk Reporting and Monitoring.
Effective risk reporting and risk decision-making depends on our ability to get the right information to the right people at the right time. As such, we focus on the rigor and effectiveness of our risk systems, with the objective of ensuring that our risk management technology systems provide us with complete, accurate and timely information. Our risk reporting and monitoring processes are designed to take into account information about both existing and emerging risks, thereby enabling our risk committees and senior management to perform their responsibilities with the appropriate level of insight into risk exposures. Furthermore, our limit and threshold breach processes provide means for timely escalation.
We evaluate changes in our risk profile and our businesses, including changes in business mix or jurisdictions in which we operate, by monitoring risk factors at a firmwide level.
•
Risk Decision-Making.
Our governance structure provides the protocol and responsibility for decision-making
on risk management issues and ensures implementation of those decisions. We make extensive use of risk committees that meet regularly and serve as an important means to facilitate and foster ongoing discussions to manage and mitigate risks.
We maintain strong and proactive communication about risk and we have a culture of collaboration in decision-making among our first and second lines of defense, committees and senior management. While our first line of defense is responsible for management of their risk, we dedicate extensive resources to our second line of defense in order to ensure a strong oversight structure and an appropriate segregation of duties. We regularly reinforce our strong culture of escalation and accountability across all functions.
People.
Even the best technology serves only as a tool for helping to make informed decisions in real time about the risks we are taking. Ultimately, effective risk management requires our people to interpret our risk data on an ongoing and timely basis and adjust risk positions accordingly. The experience of our professionals, and their understanding of the nuances and limitations of each risk measure, guides us in assessing exposures and maintaining them within prudent levels.
We reinforce a culture of effective risk management, consistent with our risk appetite, in our training and development programs, as well as in the way we evaluate performance, and recognize and reward our people. Our training and development programs, including certain sessions led by our most senior leaders, are focused on the importance of risk management, client relationships and reputational excellence. As part of our performance review process, we assess reputational excellence, including how an employee exercises good risk management and reputational judgment, and adheres to our code of conduct and compliance policies. Our review and reward processes are designed to communicate and reinforce to our professionals the link between behavior and how people are recognized, the need to focus on our clients and our reputation, and the need to always act in accordance with our highest standards.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Structure
Ultimate oversight of risk is the responsibility of our Board. The Board oversees risk both directly and through its committees, including its Risk Committee. We have a series of committees with specific risk management mandates that have oversight or decision-making responsibilities for risk management activities. Committee membership generally consists of senior managers from both our first and second lines of defense. We have established procedures for these committees to ensure that appropriate information barriers are in place. Our primary risk committees, most of which also have additional sub-committees
or working groups, are described below. In addition to these committees, we have other risk committees that provide oversight for different businesses, activities, products, regions and entities. All of our committees have responsibility for considering the impact of transactions and activities, which they oversee, on our reputation.
Membership of our risk committees is reviewed regularly and updated to reflect changes in the responsibilities of the committee members. Accordingly, the length of time that members serve on the respective committees varies as determined by the committee chairs and based on the responsibilities of the members.
The chart below presents an overview of our risk management governance structure.
Management Committee.
The Management Committee oversees our global activities. It provides this oversight directly and through authority delegated to committees it has established. This committee consists of our most senior leaders, and is chaired by our chief executive officer. Most members of the Management Committee are also members of other committees. The following are the committees that are principally involved in firmwide risk management.
Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee.
The Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing all of our financial and nonfinancial risks. As a part of such oversight, the committee is responsible for the ongoing review, approval and monitoring of our enterprise risk management framework, as well as our risk limits framework. This committee is co-chaired
by our chief financial officer and our chief risk officer, who are appointed as chairs by our chief executive officer, and reports to the Management Committee. The following are the primary committees that report to the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee:
•
Firmwide Risk Committee.
The Firmwide Risk Committee is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of relevant financial risks and related risk limits at the firmwide, business and product levels. This committee is co-chaired
by the chairs of the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee.
•
Firmwide New Activity Committee.
The Firmwide New Activity Committee is responsible for reviewing new activities and for establishing a process to identify and review previously approved activities that are significant and that have changed in complexity and/or structure or present different reputational and suitability concerns over time to consider whether these activities remain appropriate. This committee is co-chaired
by the controller and chief accounting officer, and the head of Operations and Platform Engineering for the Global Markets Division, who are appointed as chairs by the chairs of the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee.
•
Firmwide Operational Risk and Resilience Committee.

Conflicts Management
Conflicts of interest and our approach to dealing with them are fundamental to our client relationships, our reputation and our long-term success. The term “conflict of interest” does not have a universally accepted meaning, and conflicts can arise in many forms within a business or between businesses. The responsibility for identifying potential conflicts, as well as complying with our policies and procedures, is shared by all of our employees.
We have a multilayered approach to resolving conflicts and addressing reputational risk. Our senior management oversees policies related to conflicts resolution, and, in conjunction with Conflicts Resolution, Legal and Compliance, the Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee, and other internal committees, formulates policies, standards and principles, and assists in making judgments regarding the appropriate resolution of particular conflicts. Resolving potential conflicts necessarily depends on the facts and circumstances of a particular situation and the application of experienced and informed judgment.
As a general matter, Conflicts Resolution reviews financing and advisory assignments in Investment Banking and certain of our investing, lending and other activities. In addition, we have various transaction oversight committees, such as the Firmwide Capital, Commitments and Suitability Committees and other committees that also review new underwritings, loans, investments and structured products. These groups and committees work with internal and external counsel and Compliance to evaluate and address any actual or potential conflicts. Conflicts Resolution reports to our president and chief operating officer.
We regularly assess our policies and procedures that address conflicts of interest in an effort to conduct our business in accordance with the highest ethical standards and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.
Compliance Risk Management
Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to our reputation arising from our failure to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations, and our internal policies and procedures. Compliance risk is inherent in all activities through which we conduct our businesses. Our Compliance Risk Management Program, administered by Compliance, assesses our compliance, regulatory and reputational risk; monitors for compliance with new or amended laws, rules and regulations; designs and implements controls, policies, procedures and training; conducts independent testing; investigates, surveils and monitors for compliance risks and breaches; and leads our responses to regulatory examinations, audits and inquiries. We monitor and review business practices to assess whether they meet or exceed minimum regulatory and legal standards in all markets and jurisdictions in which we conduct business.

Liquidity Risk Management
Overview
Liquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to fund ourselves or meet our liquidity needs in the event of firm-specific, broader industry or market liquidity stress events. We have in place a comprehensive and conservative set of liquidity and funding policies. Our principal objective is to be able to fund ourselves and to enable our core businesses to continue to serve clients and generate revenues, even under adverse circumstances.
Treasury, which reports to our chief financial officer, has primary responsibility for developing, managing and executing our liquidity and funding strategy within our risk appetite.
Liquidity Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and Treasury, and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our liquidity risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses and the establishment of stress testing and limits frameworks.
Liquidity Risk Management Principles
We manage liquidity risk according to three principles: (i) hold sufficient excess liquidity in the form of GCLA to cover outflows during a stressed period, (ii) maintain appropriate Asset-Liability Management and (iii) maintain a viable Contingency Funding Plan.
GCLA.
GCLA is liquidity that we maintain to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in a stressed environment. A primary liquidity principle is to pre-fund
our estimated potential cash and collateral needs during a liquidity crisis and hold this liquidity in the form of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash. We believe that the securities held in our GCLA would be readily convertible to cash in a matter of days, through liquidation, by entering into repurchase agreements or from maturities of resale agreements, and that this cash would allow us to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding from credit-sensitive markets.
Our GCLA reflects the following principles:
•
The first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most critical to a company’s survival;
•
Focus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral outflows, not just disruptions to financing flows. Our businesses are diverse, and our liquidity needs are determined by many factors, including market movements, collateral requirements and client commitments, all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment;
•
During a liquidity crisis, credit-sensitive funding, including unsecured debt, certain deposits and some types of secured financing agreements, may be unavailable, and the terms (e.g., interest rates, collateral provisions and tenor) or availability of other types of secured financing may change and certain deposits may be withdrawn; and
•
As a result of our policy to pre-fund
liquidity that we estimate may be needed in a crisis, we hold more unencumbered securities and have larger funding balances than our businesses would otherwise require. We believe that our liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly liquid unencumbered securities, even though it increases our total assets and our funding costs.
We maintain our GCLA across Group Inc., Goldman Sachs Funding LLC (Funding IHC) and Group Inc.’s major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries, asset types and clearing agents to provide us with sufficient operating liquidity to ensure timely settlement in all major markets, even in a difficult funding environment. In addition to the GCLA, we maintain cash balances and securities in several of our other entities, primarily for use in specific currencies, entities or jurisdictions where we do not have immediate access to parent company liquidity.
Asset-Liability Management.
Our liquidity risk management policies are designed to ensure we have a sufficient amount of financing, even when funding markets experience persistent stress. We manage the maturities and diversity of our funding across markets, products and counterparties, and seek to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets.
Our approach to asset-liability management includes:
•
Conservatively managing the overall characteristics of our funding book, with a focus on maintaining long-term, diversified sources of funding in excess of our current requirements. See “Balance Sheet and Funding Sources - Funding Sources” for further information;
•
Actively managing and monitoring our asset base, with particular focus on the liquidity, holding period and ability to fund assets on a secured basis. We assess our funding requirements and our ability to liquidate assets in a stressed environment while appropriately managing risk. This enables us to determine the most appropriate funding products and tenors. See “Balance Sheet and Funding Sources - Balance Sheet Management” for further information about our balance sheet management process and “- Funding Sources - Secured Funding” for further information about asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis; and
Goldman Sachs 2020 Form 10-K
THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
•
Raising secured and unsecured financing that has a long tenor relative to the liquidity profile of our assets. This reduces the risk that our liabilities will come due in advance of our ability to generate liquidity from the sale of our assets. Because we maintain a highly liquid balance sheet, the holding period of certain of our assets may be materially shorter than their contractual maturity dates.
Our goal is to ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our assets and meet our contractual and contingent obligations in normal times, as well as during periods of market stress. Through our dynamic balance sheet management process, we use actual and projected asset balances to determine secured and unsecured funding requirements. Funding plans are reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee. In addition, our independent risk oversight and control functions analyze, and the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee reviews, our consolidated total capital position (unsecured long-term borrowings plus total shareholders’ equity) so that we maintain a level of long-term funding that is sufficient to meet our long-term financing requirements. In a liquidity crisis, we would first use our GCLA in order to avoid reliance on asset sales (other than our GCLA). However, we recognize that orderly asset sales may be prudent or necessary in a severe or persistent liquidity crisis.
Subsidiary Funding Policies
The majority of our unsecured funding is raised by Group Inc., which provides the necessary funds to Funding IHC and other subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their asset financing, liquidity and capital requirements. In addition, Group Inc. provides its regulated subsidiaries with the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements. The benefits of this approach to subsidiary funding are enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries. Funding is also raised at the subsidiary level through a variety of products, including deposits, secured funding and unsecured borrowings.
Our intercompany funding policies assume that a subsidiary’s funds or securities are not freely available to its parent, Funding IHC or other subsidiaries unless (i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. In particular, many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Group Inc. or Funding IHC. Regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on its obligations. Accordingly, we assume that the capital provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or other subsidiaries and any other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or Funding IHC until the maturity of such financing.
Group Inc. has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness, directly or indirectly, to its regulated subsidiaries. For example, as of December 2020, Group Inc. had $34.54 billion of equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in GS&Co., its principal U.S. registered broker-dealer; $42.12 billion invested in GSI, a regulated U.K. broker-dealer; $3.32 billion invested in GSJCL, a regulated Japanese broker-dealer; $34.30 billion invested in GS Bank USA, a regulated New York State-chartered bank; $4.13 billion invested in GSIB, a regulated U.K. bank; and $4.06 billion invested in GSBE, a regulated German bank. Group Inc. also provided, directly or indirectly, $111.96 billion of unsubordinated loans (including secured loans of $47.98 billion) and $16.65 billion of collateral and cash deposits to these entities, substantially all of which was to GS&Co., GSI and GSJCL, as of December 2020. In addition, as of December 2020, Group Inc. had significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries.
Contingency Funding Plan.
We maintain a contingency funding plan to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market stress. Our contingency funding plan outlines a list of potential risk factors, key reports and metrics that are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assist in assessing the severity of, and managing through, a liquidity crisis and/or market dislocation. The contingency funding plan also describes in detail our potential responses if our assessments indicate that we have entered a liquidity crisis, which include pre-funding
for what we estimate will be our potential cash and collateral needs, as well as utilizing secondary sources of liquidity. Mitigants and action items to address specific risks which may arise are also described and assigned to individuals responsible for execution.
The contingency funding plan identifies key groups of individuals and their responsibilities, which include fostering effective coordination, control and distribution of information, implementing liquidity maintenance activities and managing internal and external communication, all of which are critical in the management of a crisis or period of market stress.

Stress Tests
In order to determine the appropriate size of our GCLA, we model liquidity outflows over a range of scenarios and time horizons. One of our primary internal liquidity risk models, referred to as the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, quantifies our liquidity risks over a 30-day
stress scenario. We also consider other factors, including, but not limited to, an assessment of our potential intraday liquidity needs through an additional internal liquidity risk model, referred to as the Intraday Liquidity Model, the results of our long-term stress testing models, our resolution liquidity models and other applicable regulatory requirements and a qualitative assessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets. The results of the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, the Intraday Liquidity Model, the long-term stress testing models and the resolution liquidity models are reported to senior management on a regular basis. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about firmwide stress tests.
Modeled Liquidity Outflow.
Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow is based on conducting multiple scenarios that include combinations of market-wide and firm-specific stress. These scenarios are characterized by the following qualitative elements:
•
Severely challenged market environments, which includes low consumer and corporate confidence, financial and political instability, and adverse changes in market values, including potential declines in equity markets and widening of credit spreads; and
•
A firm-specific crisis potentially triggered by material losses, reputational damage, litigation and/or a ratings downgrade.
The following are key modeling elements of our Modeled Liquidity Outflow:
•
Liquidity needs over a 30-day
scenario;
•
A two-notch
downgrade of our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings;
•
Changing conditions in funding markets, which limit our access to unsecured and secured funding;
•
No support from additional government funding facilities. Although we have access to various central bank funding programs, we do not assume reliance on additional sources of funding in a liquidity crisis; and
•
A combination of contractual outflows, such as upcoming maturities of unsecured debt, and contingent outflows, including, but not limited to, the withdrawal of customer credit balances in our prime brokerage business, increase in variation margin requirements due to adverse changes in the value of our exchange-traded and OTC-cleared
derivatives, and withdrawals of deposits that have no contractual maturity.
Intraday Liquidity Model.
Our Intraday Liquidity Model measures our intraday liquidity needs using a scenario analysis characterized by the same qualitative elements as our Modeled Liquidity Outflow. The model assesses the risk of increased intraday liquidity requirements during a scenario where access to sources of intraday liquidity may become constrained.
Long-Term Stress Testing.
We utilize longer-term stress tests to take a forward view on our liquidity position through prolonged stress periods in which we experience a severe liquidity stress and recover in an environment that continues to be challenging. We are focused on ensuring conservative asset-liability management to prepare for a prolonged period of potential stress, seeking to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets.
Resolution Liquidity Models.
In connection with our resolution planning efforts, we have established our Resolution Liquidity Adequacy and Positioning framework, which estimates liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries in a stressed environment. The liquidity needs are measured using our Modeled Liquidity Outflow assumptions and include certain additional inter-affiliate exposures. We have also established our Resolution Liquidity Execution Need framework, which measures the liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries to stabilize and wind-down following a Group Inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy.
In addition, we have established a triggers and alerts framework, which is designed to provide the Board with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc.
Limits
We use liquidity risk limits at various levels and across liquidity risk types to manage the size of our liquidity exposures. Limits are measured relative to acceptable levels of risk given our liquidity risk tolerance. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about the limit approval process.
Limits are monitored by Treasury and Liquidity Risk. Liquidity Risk is responsible for identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded.

GCLA and Unencumbered Metrics
GCLA.
Based on the results of our internal liquidity risk models, described above, as well as our consideration of other factors, including, but not limited to, a qualitative assessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets, we believe our liquidity position as of both December 2020 and December 2019 was appropriate. We strictly limit our GCLA to a narrowly defined list of securities and cash because they are highly liquid, even in a difficult funding environment. We do not include other potential sources of excess liquidity in our GCLA, such as less liquid unencumbered securities or committed credit facilities.
The table below presents information about our GCLA.
In the table above:
•
The U.S. dollar-denominated GCLA consists of (i) unencumbered U.S. government and agency obligations (including highly liquid U.S. agency mortgage-backed obligations), all of which are eligible as collateral in Federal Reserve open market operations and (ii) certain overnight U.S. dollar cash deposits.
•
The non-U.S.
dollar-denominated GCLA consists of non-U.S.
government obligations (only unencumbered German, French, Japanese and U.K. government obligations) and certain overnight cash deposits in highly liquid currencies.
We maintain our GCLA to enable us to meet current and potential liquidity requirements of our parent company, Group Inc., and its subsidiaries. Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow and Intraday Liquidity Model incorporate a requirement for Group Inc., as well as a standalone requirement for each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries. Funding IHC is required to provide the necessary liquidity to Group Inc. during the ordinary course of business, and is also obligated to provide capital and liquidity support to major subsidiaries in the event of our material financial distress or failure. Liquidity held directly in each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries is intended for use only by that subsidiary to meet its liquidity requirements and is assumed not to be available to Group Inc. or Funding IHC unless (i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. In addition, the Modeled Liquidity Outflow and Intraday Liquidity Model also incorporate a broader assessment of standalone liquidity requirements for other subsidiaries and we hold a portion of our GCLA directly at Group Inc. or Funding IHC to support such requirements.
Other Unencumbered Assets.
In addition to our GCLA, we have a significant amount of other unencumbered cash and financial instruments, including other government obligations, high-grade money market securities, corporate obligations, marginable equities, loans and cash deposits not included in our GCLA. The fair value of our unencumbered assets averaged $214.06 billion for the three months ended December 2020, $206.01 billion for the three months ended December 2019, $207.60 billion for the year ended December 2020 and $202.03 billion for the year ended December 2019. We do not consider these assets liquid enough to be eligible for our GCLA.
Liquidity Regulatory Framework
As a BHC, we are subject to a minimum Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) under the LCR rule approved by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. The LCR rule requires organizations to maintain an adequate ratio of eligible high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to expected net cash outflows under an acute short-term liquidity stress scenario. Eligible HQLA excludes HQLA held by subsidiaries that is in excess of their minimum requirement and is subject to transfer restrictions. We are required to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%. We expect that fluctuations in client activity, business mix and the market environment will impact our LCR.
Goldman Sachs 2020 Form 10-K
THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The table below presents information about our average daily LCR.
In October 2020, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that establishes a net stable funding ratio (NSFR) requirement for large U.S. banking organizations. This rule will become effective on July 1, 2021 and requires banking organizations to ensure they have access to stable funding over a one-year
time horizon. The rule also requires disclosure of the ratio on a semi-annual basis and a description of the banking organization’s stable funding sources beginning in 2023.
The following provides information about our subsidiary liquidity regulatory requirements:
•
GS Bank USA.
GS Bank USA is subject to a minimum LCR of 100% under the LCR rule approved by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. As of December 2020, GS Bank USA’s LCR exceeded the minimum requirement. The NSFR requirement described above will also apply to GS Bank USA.
•
GSI.
GSI is subject to a minimum LCR of 100% under the LCR rule approved by the U.K. regulatory authorities. GSI’s average monthly LCR for the trailing twelve-month period ended December 2020 exceeded the minimum requirement.
•
Other Subsidiaries.
We monitor local regulatory liquidity requirements of our subsidiaries to ensure compliance. For many of our subsidiaries, these requirements either have changed or are likely to change in the future due to the implementation of the Basel Committee’s framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring, as well as other regulatory developments.
The implementation of these rules and any amendments adopted by the regulatory authorities could impact our liquidity and funding requirements and practices in the future.
Credit Ratings
We rely on the short- and long-term debt capital markets to fund a significant portion of our day-to-day
operations and the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings. Credit ratings are also important when we are competing in certain markets, such as OTC derivatives, and when we seek to engage in longer-term transactions. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K
for information about the risks associated with a reduction in our credit ratings.
The table below presents the unsecured credit ratings and outlook of Group Inc.
In the table above:
•
The ratings and outlook are by DBRS, Inc. (DBRS), Fitch, Inc. (Fitch), Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I), and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P).
•
The ratings for trust preferred relate to the guaranteed preferred beneficial interests issued by Goldman Sachs Capital I.
•
The DBRS, Fitch, Moody’s and S&P ratings for preferred stock include the APEX issued by Goldman Sachs Capital II and Goldman Sachs Capital III.
In January 2021, Moody’s upgraded Group Inc.’s long-term debt ratings (from A3 to A2) and short-term debt ratings (from P-2
to P-1),
and has returned the outlook from ratings under review to stable.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The table below presents the unsecured credit ratings and outlook of GS Bank USA, GSIB, GSBE, GS&Co. and GSI.
We believe our credit ratings are primarily based on the credit rating agencies’ assessment of:
•
Our liquidity, market, credit and operational risk management practices;
•
Our level and variability of earnings;
•
Our capital base;
•
Our franchise, reputation and management;
•
Our corporate governance; and
•
The external operating and economic environment, including, in some cases, the assumed level of government support or other systemic considerations, such as potential resolution.
Certain of our derivatives have been transacted under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings. We manage our GCLA to ensure we would, among other potential requirements, be able to make the additional collateral or termination payments that may be required in the event of a two-notch
reduction in our long-term credit ratings, as well as collateral that has not been called by counterparties, but is available to them.
See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about derivatives with credit-related contingent features and the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a one-
or two-notch
downgrade in our credit ratings.
Cash Flows
As a global financial institution, our cash flows are complex and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets. Consequently, we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the liquidity and asset-liability management policies described above. Cash flow analysis may, however, be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and strategic initiatives in our businesses.
Year Ended December 2020.
Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $22.30 billion to $155.84 billion at the end of 2020, primarily due to net cash provided by financing activities, partially offset by net cash used for investing activities and operating activities. The net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected an increase in net deposits, reflecting increases in consumer, transaction banking and private bank deposits. The net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected an increase in net purchases of investments, reflecting an increase in U.S. government obligations accounted for as available-for-sale
and an increase in net lending activities. The net cash used for operating activities primarily reflected an increase in trading assets, net customer and other receivables and payables, and collateralized transactions (an increase in collateralized agreements, partially offset by an increase in collateralized financings), partially offset by an increase in trading liabilities as a result of our and our clients’ activities.
Year Ended December 2019.
Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $3.00 billion to $133.55 billion at the end of 2019, primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities and financing activities, partially offset by net cash used for investing activities. The net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflected cash provided by collateralized transactions (a decrease in collateralized agreements and an increase in collateralized financings) as a result of our and our clients’ activities, partially offset by an increase in trading assets, as a result of client activity. The net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected an increase in consumer deposits, partially offset by net repayments of unsecured long-term borrowings and common stock repurchases. The net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected net purchases of investments and an increase in loans.
For an analysis of cash flows for the year ended December 2018, see Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Market Risk Management
Overview
Market risk is the risk of loss in the value of our inventory, investments, loans and other financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value due to changes in market conditions. We hold such positions primarily for market making for our clients and for our investing and financing activities, and therefore, these positions change based on client demands and our investment opportunities. Since these positions are accounted for at fair value, they fluctuate on a daily basis, with the related gains and losses included in the consolidated statements of earnings. We employ a variety of risk measures, each described in the respective sections below, to monitor market risk. Categories of market risk include the following:
•
Interest rate risk: results from exposures to changes in the level, slope and curvature of yield curves, the volatilities of interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit spreads;
•
Equity price risk: results from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities, baskets of equities and equity indices;
•
Currency rate risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of currency rates; and
•
Commodity price risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of commodities, such as crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity, and precious and base metals.
Market Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our market risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses.
Managers in revenue-producing units and Market Risk discuss market information, positions and estimated loss scenarios on an ongoing basis. Managers in revenue-producing units are accountable for managing risk within prescribed limits. These managers have in-depth
knowledge of their positions, markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures.
Market Risk Management Process
Our process for managing market risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the “Overview and Structure of Risk Management,” as well as the following:
•
Monitoring compliance with established market risk limits and reporting our exposures;
•
Diversifying exposures;
•
Controlling position sizes; and
•
Evaluating mitigants, such as economic hedges in related securities or derivatives.
Our market risk management systems enable us to perform an independent calculation of VaR and stress measures, capture risk measures at individual position levels, attribute risk measures to individual risk factors of each position, report many different views of the risk measures (e.g., by desk, business, product type or entity) and produce ad hoc analyses in a timely manner.
Risk Measures
We produce risk measures and monitor them against established market risk limits. These measures reflect an extensive range of scenarios and the results are aggregated at product, business and firmwide levels.
We use a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of potential losses for both moderate and more extreme market moves over both short- and long-term time horizons. Our primary risk measures are VaR, which is used for shorter-term periods, and stress tests. Our risk reports detail key risks, drivers and changes for each desk and business, and are distributed daily to senior management of both our revenue-producing units and our independent risk oversight and control functions.

Value-at-Risk.
VaR is the potential loss in value due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level. For assets and liabilities included in VaR, see “Financial Statement Linkages to Market Risk Measures.” We typically employ a one-day
time horizon with a 95% confidence level. We use a single VaR model, which captures risks, including interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. As such, VaR facilitates comparison across portfolios of different risk characteristics. VaR also captures the diversification of aggregated risk at the firmwide level.
We are aware of the inherent limitations to VaR and therefore use a variety of risk measures in our market risk management process. Inherent limitations to VaR include:
•
VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time horizons where moves may be extreme;
•
VaR does not take account of the relative liquidity of different risk positions; and
•
Previous moves in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of all future market moves.
To comprehensively capture our exposures and relevant risks in our VaR calculation, we use historical simulations with full valuation of market factors at the position level by simultaneously shocking the relevant market factors for that position. These market factors include spot prices, credit spreads, funding spreads, yield curves, volatility and correlation, and are updated periodically based on changes in the composition of positions, as well as variations in market conditions. We sample from five years of historical data to generate the scenarios for our VaR calculation. The historical data is weighted so that the relative importance of the data reduces over time. This gives greater importance to more recent observations and reflects current asset volatilities, which improves the accuracy of our estimates of potential loss. As a result, even if our positions included in VaR were unchanged, our VaR would increase with increasing market volatility and vice versa.
Given its reliance on historical data, VaR is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions.
Our VaR measure does not include:
•
Positions that are best measured and monitored using sensitivity measures; and
•
The impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected.
We perform daily backtesting of our VaR model (i.e., comparing daily net revenues for positions included in VaR to the VaR measure calculated as of the prior business day) at the firmwide level and for each of our businesses and major regulated subsidiaries.
Stress Testing.
Stress testing is a method of determining the effect of various hypothetical stress scenarios. We use stress testing to examine risks of specific portfolios, as well as the potential impact of our significant risk exposures. We use a variety of stress testing techniques to calculate the potential loss from a wide range of market moves on our portfolios, including firmwide stress tests, sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis. The results of our various stress tests are analyzed together for risk management purposes. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about firmwide stress tests.
Sensitivity analysis is used to quantify the impact of a market move in a single risk factor across all positions (e.g., equity prices or credit spreads) using a variety of defined market shocks, ranging from those that could be expected over a one-day
time horizon up to those that could take many months to occur. We also use sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of the default of any single entity, which captures the risk of large or concentrated exposures.
Scenario analysis is used to quantify the impact of a specified event, including how the event impacts multiple risk factors simultaneously. For example, for sovereign stress testing we calculate potential direct exposure associated with our sovereign positions, as well as the corresponding debt, equity and currency exposures associated with our non-sovereign
positions that may be impacted by the sovereign distress. When conducting scenario analysis, we often consider a number of possible outcomes for each scenario, ranging from moderate to severely adverse market impacts. In addition, these stress tests are constructed using both historical events and forward-looking hypothetical scenarios.
Unlike VaR measures, which have an implied probability because they are calculated at a specified confidence level, there may not be an implied probability that our stress testing scenarios will occur. Instead, stress testing is used to model both moderate and more extreme moves in underlying market factors. When estimating potential loss, we generally assume that our positions cannot be reduced or hedged (although experience demonstrates that we are generally able to do so).

Limits
We use market risk limits at various levels to manage the size of our market exposures. These limits are set based on VaR and on a range of stress tests relevant to our exposures. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about the limit approval process.
Market Risk is responsible for monitoring these limits, and identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded (e.g., due to positional changes or changes in market conditions, such as increased volatilities or changes in correlations). Such instances are remediated by a reduction in the positions we hold and/or a temporary or permanent increase to the limit.
Metrics
We analyze VaR at the firmwide level and a variety of more detailed levels, including by risk category, business and region. Diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for the four risk categories. This effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated.
The table below presents our average daily VaR.
Our average daily VaR increased to $94 million in 2020 from $56 million in 2019, due to increases in the equity prices, interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices categories, partially offset by an increase in the diversification effect. The overall increase was primarily due to higher levels of volatility.
The table below presents our period-end
VaR.
Our period-end
VaR increased to $91 million as of December 2020 from $70 million as of December 2019, due to increases in the interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices categories, partially offset by an increase in the diversification effect. The overall increase was primarily due to increased exposures.
During 2020, the firmwide VaR risk limit was exceeded on 16 occasions (all of which occurred during the first half of 2020), primarily due to higher levels of volatility. There were no permanent changes to the firmwide VaR risk limit during this period. However, there were temporary increases to the firmwide VaR risk limit as a result of the market environment. During 2019, the firmwide VaR risk limit was not exceeded, raised or reduced.
The table below presents our high and low VaR.
The chart below presents our daily VaR for 2020.
The table below presents, by number of business days, the frequency distribution of our daily net revenues for positions included in VaR.
Daily net revenues for positions included in VaR are compared with VaR calculated as of the end of the prior business day. Net losses incurred on a single day for such positions exceeded our 95% one-day
VaR (i.e., a VaR exception) on two occasions during 2020 and did not exceed our 95% one-day
VaR during 2019.
Goldman Sachs 2020 Form 10-K
THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
During periods in which we have significantly more positive net revenue days than net revenue loss days, we expect to have fewer VaR exceptions because, under normal conditions, our business model generally produces positive net revenues. In periods in which our franchise revenues are adversely affected, we generally have more loss days, resulting in more VaR exceptions. The daily net revenues for positions included in VaR used to determine VaR exceptions reflect the impact of any intraday activity, including bid/offer net revenues, which are more likely than not to be positive by their nature.
Sensitivity Measures
Certain portfolios and individual positions are not included in VaR because VaR is not the most appropriate risk measure. Other sensitivity measures we use to analyze market risk are described below.
10% Sensitivity Measures.
The table below presents our market risk by asset category for positions accounted for at fair value, that are not included in VaR.
In the table above:
•
The market risk of these positions is determined by estimating the potential reduction in net revenues of a 10% decline in the value of these positions.
•
Equity positions relate to private and restricted public equity securities, including interests in funds that invest in corporate equities and real estate and interests in hedge funds.
•
Debt positions include interests in funds that invest in corporate mezzanine and senior debt instruments, loans backed by commercial and residential real estate, corporate bank loans and other corporate debt, including acquired portfolios of distressed loans.
•
Funded equity and debt positions are included in our consolidated balance sheets in investments and loans. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about investments and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about loans.
•
These measures do not reflect the diversification effect across asset categories or across other market risk measures.
Credit and Funding Spread Sensitivity on Derivatives and Financial Liabilities.
VaR excludes the impact of changes in counterparty credit spreads, our own credit spreads and unsecured funding spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own credit spreads (debt valuation adjustment) on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected. The estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in credit spreads (counterparty and our own) and unsecured funding spreads on derivatives (including hedges) was a loss of $3 million as of December 2020 and $2 million as of December 2019. In addition, the estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected was a gain of $22 million as of December 2020 and $29 million as of December 2019. However, the actual net impact of a change in our own credit spreads is also affected by the liquidity, duration and convexity (as the sensitivity is not linear to changes in yields) of those financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected, as well as the relative performance of any hedges undertaken.
Interest Rate Sensitivity.
Loans accounted for at amortized cost were $99.69 billion as of December 2020 and $89.20 billion as of December 2019, substantially all of which had floating interest rates. The estimated sensitivity to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on such loans was $737 million as of December 2020 and $681 million as of December 2019 of additional interest income over a twelve-month period, which does not take into account the potential impact of an increase in costs to fund such loans. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about loans accounted for at amortized cost.
Other Market Risk Considerations
We make investments in securities that are accounted for as available-for-sale,
held-to-maturity
or under the equity method which are included in investments in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
Direct investments in real estate are accounted for at cost less accumulated depreciation. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about other assets.

Credit Risk Management
Overview
Credit risk represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty (e.g., an OTC derivatives counterparty or a borrower) or an issuer of securities or other instruments we hold. Our exposure to credit risk comes mostly from client transactions in OTC derivatives and loans and lending commitments. Credit risk also comes from cash placed with banks, securities financing transactions (i.e., resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending activities) and customer and other receivables.
Credit Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our credit risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses. In addition, we hold other positions that give rise to credit risk (e.g., bonds and secondary bank loans). These credit risks are captured as a component of market risk measures, which are monitored and managed by Market Risk. We also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. Such derivatives also give rise to credit risk, which is monitored and managed by Credit Risk.
Credit Risk Management Process
Our process for managing credit risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the “Overview and Structure of Risk Management,” as well as the following:
•
Monitoring compliance with established credit risk limits and reporting our credit exposures and credit concentrations;
•
Establishing or approving underwriting standards;
•
Assessing the likelihood that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations;
•
Measuring our current and potential credit exposure and losses resulting from a counterparty default;
•
Using credit risk mitigants, including collateral and hedging; and
•
Maximizing recovery through active workout and restructuring of claims.
We also perform credit reviews, which include initial and ongoing analyses of our counterparties. For substantially all of our credit exposures, the core of our process is an annual counterparty credit review. A credit review is an independent analysis of the capacity and willingness of a counterparty to meet its financial obligations, resulting in an internal credit rating. The determination of internal credit ratings also incorporates assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the counterparty’s industry, and the economic environment. Senior personnel, with expertise in specific industries, inspect and approve credit reviews and internal credit ratings.
Our risk assessment process may also include, where applicable, reviewing certain key metrics, including, but not limited to, delinquency status, collateral values, FICO credit scores and other risk factors.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Our credit risk management systems capture credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their subsidiaries. These systems also provide management with comprehensive information about our aggregate credit risk by product, internal credit rating, industry, country and region.
Risk Measures
We measure our credit risk based on the potential loss in the event of non-payment
by a counterparty using current and potential exposure. For derivatives and securities financing transactions, current exposure represents the amount presently owed to us after taking into account applicable netting and collateral arrangements, while potential exposure represents our estimate of the future exposure that could arise over the life of a transaction based on market movements within a specified confidence level. Potential exposure also takes into account netting and collateral arrangements. For loans and lending commitments, the primary measure is a function of the notional amount of the position.
Stress Tests
We conduct regular stress tests to calculate the credit exposures, including potential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates, equity prices). These shocks cover a wide range of moderate and more extreme market movements, including shocks to multiple risk factors, consistent with the occurrence of a severe market or economic event. In the case of sovereign default, we estimate the direct impact of the default on our sovereign credit exposures, changes to our credit exposures arising from potential market moves in response to the default, and the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties that may result from the sovereign default. Unlike potential exposure, which is calculated within a specified confidence level, stress testing does not generally assume a probability of these events occurring. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about firmwide stress tests.
To supplement these regular stress tests, as described above, we also conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to specific market events that we deem significant. We also utilize these stress tests to estimate the indirect impact of certain hypothetical events on our country exposures, such as the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties along with the shocks to the risk factors described above. The parameters of these shocks vary based on the scenario reflected in each stress test. We review estimated losses produced by the stress tests in order to understand their magnitude, highlight potential loss concentrations, and assess and mitigate our exposures where necessary.
Limits
We use credit risk limits at various levels, as well as underwriting standards to manage the size and nature of our credit exposures. Limits for industries and countries are based on our risk appetite and are designed to allow for regular monitoring, review, escalation and management of credit risk concentrations. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about the limit approval process.
Credit Risk is responsible for monitoring these limits, and identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded.
Risk Mitigants
To reduce our credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions, we may enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. We may also reduce credit risk with counterparties by entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or contingent basis and/or to terminate transactions if the counterparty’s credit rating falls below a specified level. We monitor the fair value of the collateral to ensure that our credit exposures are appropriately collateralized. We seek to minimize exposures where there is a significant positive correlation between the creditworthiness of our counterparties and the market value of collateral we receive.
For loans and lending commitments, depending on the credit quality of the borrower and other characteristics of the transaction, we employ a variety of potential risk mitigants. Risk mitigants include collateral provisions, guarantees, covenants, structural seniority of the bank loan claims and, for certain lending commitments, provisions in the legal documentation that allow us to adjust loan amounts, pricing, structure and other terms as market conditions change. The type and structure of risk mitigants employed can significantly influence the degree of credit risk involved in a loan or lending commitment.
When we do not have sufficient visibility into a counterparty’s financial strength or when we believe a counterparty requires support from its parent, we may obtain third-party guarantees of the counterparty’s obligations. We may also mitigate our credit risk using credit derivatives or participation agreements.

Credit Exposures
As of December 2020, our aggregate credit exposure increased as compared with December 2019, primarily reflecting increases in cash deposits with central banks and OTC derivatives. The percentage of our credit exposures arising from non-investment-grade
counterparties (based on our internally determined public rating agency equivalents) increased as compared with December 2019, primarily reflecting an increase in non-investment-grade
credit exposure related to OTC derivatives and loans and lending commitments. Our credit exposure to counterparties that defaulted during 2020 was higher as compared with our credit exposure to counterparties that defaulted during 2019, and such exposure was primarily related to loans and lending commitments. Our credit exposure to counterparties that defaulted during 2020 remained low, representing approximately 1% of our total credit exposure. Estimated losses associated with these defaults have been recognized in earnings. Our credit exposures are described further below.
Cash and Cash Equivalents.
Our credit exposure on cash and cash equivalents arises from our unrestricted cash, and includes both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing
deposits. To mitigate the risk of credit loss, we place substantially all of our deposits with highly rated banks and central banks.
The table below presents our credit exposure from unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and the concentration by industry, region and internally determined public rating agency equivalents.
The table above excludes cash segregated for regulatory and other purposes of $24.52 billion as of December 2020 and $22.78 billion as of December 2019.
OTC Derivatives.
Our credit exposure on OTC derivatives arises primarily from our market-making activities. As a market maker, we enter into derivative transactions to provide liquidity to clients and to facilitate the transfer and hedging of their risks. We also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. We manage our credit exposure on OTC derivatives using the credit risk process, measures, limits and risk mitigants described above.
We generally enter into OTC derivatives transactions under bilateral collateral arrangements that require the daily exchange of collateral. As credit risk is an essential component of fair value, we include a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) in the fair value of derivatives to reflect counterparty credit risk, as described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. CVA is a function of the present value of expected exposure, the probability of counterparty default and the assumed recovery upon default.
The table below presents our net credit exposure from OTC derivatives and the concentration by industry and region.
In the table above:
•
OTC derivative assets, included in the consolidated balance sheets, are reported on a net-by-counterparty
basis (i.e., the net receivable for a given counterparty) when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement (counterparty netting) and are accounted for at fair value, net of cash collateral received under enforceable credit support agreements (cash collateral netting).
•
Collateral represents cash collateral and the fair value of securities collateral, primarily U.S. and non-U.S.
government and agency obligations, received under credit support agreements, that we consider when determining credit risk, but such collateral is not eligible for netting under U.S. GAAP.

The tables below present the distribution of our net credit exposure from OTC derivatives by tenor and internally determined public rating agency equivalents.
Lending Activities.
We manage our lending activities using the credit risk process, measures, limits and risk mitigants described above. Other lending positions, including secondary trading positions, are risk-managed as a component of market risk.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, we conformed the classification of our lending portfolio with Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements. Prior period amounts have been conformed to the current presentation.

Corporate.
Corporate loans and lending commitments include term loans, revolving lines of credit, letter of credit facilities and bridge loans, and are principally used for operating and general corporate purposes, or in connection with acquisitions. Corporate loans may be secured or unsecured, depending on the loan purpose, the risk profile of the borrower and other factors.
The table below presents our credit exposure from corporate loans and lending commitments, and the concentration by industry, region, internally determined public rating agency equivalents and other credit metrics.
In the table above, credit exposure excludes $3.20 billion as of December 2020 and $4.10 billion as of December 2019 relating to issued letters of credit which are classified as guarantees in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about guarantees.
Wealth Management.
Wealth management loans and lending commitments are extended to private bank clients, including wealth management and other clients. These loans are used to finance investments in both financial and nonfinancial assets, bridge cash flow timing gaps or provide liquidity for other needs. Substantially all of such loans are secured by securities, residential real estate, commercial real estate or other assets.
The table below presents our credit exposure from wealth management loans and lending commitments, and the concentration by region, internally determined public rating agency equivalents and other credit metrics.
In the table above, other/unrated loans primarily include loans backed by residential real estate. Our risk assessment process for such loans include reviewing certain key metrics, such as loan-to-value
ratio and delinquency status.

The table below presents our credit exposure from other loans and lending commitments, and the concentration by region internally determined public rating agency equivalents and other credit metrics.
In the table above:
•
Credit exposure includes loans and lending commitments extended to clients who warehouse assets of $7.28 billion as of December 2020 and $6.09 billion as of December 2019.
•
Other/unrated primarily includes consumer and credit card loans purchased by us. Our risk assessment process for such loans includes reviewing certain key metrics, such as expected cash flows, delinquency status and other risk factors.
In addition, we also have exposure to other loans held for securitization of $420 million as of December 2020 and $347 million as of December 2019. Such loans are included in trading assets in our consolidated balance sheets.
Credit Hedges
To mitigate the credit risk associated with our lending activities, we obtain credit protection on certain loans and lending commitments through credit default swaps, both single-name and index-based contracts, and through the issuance of credit-linked notes. In addition, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. provides us with credit loss protection on certain approved loan commitments.

Securities Financing Transactions.
We enter into securities financing transactions in order to, among other things, facilitate client activities, invest excess cash, acquire securities to cover short positions and finance certain activities. We bear credit risk related to resale agreements and securities borrowed only to the extent that cash advanced or the value of securities pledged or delivered to the counterparty exceeds the value of the collateral received. We also have credit exposure on repurchase agreements and securities loaned to the extent that the value of securities pledged or delivered to the counterparty for these transactions exceeds the amount of cash or collateral received. Securities collateral for these transactions primarily includes U.S. and non-U.S.
government and agency obligations.
The table below presents our credit exposure from securities financing transactions and the concentration by industry, region and internally determined public rating agency equivalents.
The table above reflects both netting agreements and collateral that we consider when determining credit risk.
Other Credit Exposures.
We are exposed to credit risk from our receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations and customers and counterparties. Receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations primarily consist of initial margin placed with clearing organizations and receivables related to sales of securities which have traded, but not yet settled. These receivables generally have minimal credit risk due to the low probability of clearing organization default and the short-term nature of receivables related to securities settlements. Receivables from customers and counterparties generally consist of collateralized receivables related to customer securities transactions and generally have minimal credit risk due to both the value of the collateral received and the short-term nature of these receivables.
The table below presents our other credit exposures and the concentration by industry, region and internally determined public rating agency equivalents.
The table above reflects collateral that we consider when determining credit risk.
Selected Exposures
We have credit and market exposures, as described below, that have had heightened focus given recent events and broad market concerns. Credit exposure represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty or borrower. Market exposure represents the potential for loss in value of our long and short positions due to changes in market prices.

Country Exposures.
Liquidity pressures prompted the Argentine government to default and restructure local and foreign obligations in 2020. Economic challenges persist and the country still needs to secure new financial terms with the IMF. As of December 2020, our total credit exposure to Argentina was $164 million, which was with non-sovereign
counterparties or borrowers, and was primarily related to loans and lending commitments. Our total market exposure to Argentina as of December 2020 was not material.
The restructuring of Lebanon’s sovereign debt and sharp currency depreciation have led to concerns about its financial and political stability. As of December 2020, our total credit exposure to Lebanon was $196 million, all of which related to loans and lending commitments with non-sovereign
borrowers. Our total market exposure to Lebanon as of December 2020 was not material.
Zambia’s sovereign debt default and ongoing liquidity pressures aggravated by the COVID-19
pandemic have led to concerns about Zambia’s financial stability. As of December 2020, our total credit and market exposure for Zambia was not material.
Venezuela has delayed payments on its sovereign debt and its political situation remains unclear. As of December 2020, our total credit and market exposure for Venezuela was not material.
We have a comprehensive framework to monitor, measure and assess our country exposures and to determine our risk appetite. We determine the country of risk by the location of the counterparty, issuer or underlier’s assets, where they generate revenue, the country in which they are headquartered, the jurisdiction where a claim against them could be enforced, and/or the government whose policies affect their ability to repay their obligations. We monitor our credit exposure to a specific country both at the individual counterparty level, as well as at the aggregate country level. See “Stress Tests” for information about stress tests that are designed to estimate the direct and indirect impact of events involving the above countries.
Industry Exposures.
The decline in oil prices has led to market concerns regarding the creditworthiness of certain companies in the oil and gas industry.

Operational Risk Management
Overview
Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or from external events. Our exposure to operational risk arises from routine processing errors, as well as extraordinary incidents, such as major systems failures or legal and regulatory matters.
Potential types of loss events related to internal and external operational risk include:
•
Clients, products and business practices;
•
Execution, delivery and process management;
•
Business disruption and system failures;
•
Employment practices and workplace safety;
•
Damage to physical assets;
•
Internal fraud; and
•
External fraud.
Operational Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for developing and implementing a formalized framework for assessing, monitoring and managing operational risk with the goal of maintaining our exposure to operational risk at levels that are within our risk appetite.
Operational Risk Management Process
Our process for managing operational risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the “Overview and Structure of Risk Management,” including a comprehensive data collection process, as well as firmwide policies and procedures, for operational risk events.
We combine top-down
and bottom-up
approaches to manage and measure operational risk. From a top-down
perspective, our senior management assesses firmwide and business-level operational risk profiles. From a bottom-up
perspective, our first and second lines of defense are responsible for risk identification and risk management on a day-to-day
basis, including escalating operational risks to senior management.
We maintain a comprehensive control framework designed to provide a well-controlled environment to minimize operational risks. The Firmwide Operational Risk and Resilience Committee is responsible for overseeing operational risk, and for ensuring our business and operational resilience.
Our operational risk management framework is in part designed to comply with the operational risk measurement rules under the Capital Framework and has evolved based on the changing needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance.
We have established policies that require all employees to report and escalate operational risk events. When operational risk events are identified, our policies require that the events be documented and analyzed to determine whether changes are required in our systems and/or processes to further mitigate the risk of future events.
We use operational risk management applications to capture and organize operational risk event data and key metrics. One of our key risk identification and assessment tools is an operational risk and control self-assessment process, which is performed by our managers. This process consists of the identification and rating of operational risks, on a forward-looking basis, and the related controls. The results from this process are analyzed to evaluate operational risk exposures and identify businesses, activities or products with heightened levels of operational risk.

Risk Measurement
We measure our operational risk exposure using both statistical modeling and scenario analyses, which involve qualitative and quantitative assessments of internal and external operational risk event data and internal control factors for each of our businesses. Operational risk measurement also incorporates an assessment of business environment factors, including:
•
Evaluations of the complexity of our business activities;
•
The degree of automation in our processes;
•
New activity information;
•
The legal and regulatory environment; and
•
Changes in the markets for our products and services, including the diversity and sophistication of our customers and counterparties.
The results from these scenario analyses are used to monitor changes in operational risk and to determine business lines that may have heightened exposure to operational risk. These analyses are used in the determination of the appropriate level of operational risk capital to hold. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about firmwide stress tests.
Types of Operational Risks
Increased reliance on technology and third-party relationships has resulted in increased operational risks, such as information and cyber security risk, third-party risk and business resilience risk. We manage those risks as follows:
Information and Cyber Security Risk.
Information and cyber security risk is the risk of compromising the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our data and systems, leading to an adverse impact to us, our reputation, our clients and/or the broader financial system. We seek to minimize the occurrence and impact of unauthorized access, disruption or use of information and/or information systems. We deploy and operate preventive and detective controls and processes to mitigate emerging and evolving information security and cyber security threats, including monitoring our network for known vulnerabilities and signs of unauthorized attempts to access our data and systems. There is increased information risk through diversification of our data across external service providers, including use of a variety of cloud-provided or -hosted services and applications. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K
for further information about information and cyber security risk.
Third-Party Risk.
Third-party risk, including vendor risk, is the risk of an adverse impact due to reliance on third parties performing services or activities on our behalf. These risks may include legal, regulatory, information security, reputational, operational or any other risks inherent in engaging a third party. We identify, manage and report key third-party risks and conduct due diligence across multiple risk domains, including information security and cyber security, resilience and additional third-party dependencies. The Third-Party Risk Program monitors, reviews and reassesses third-party risks on an ongoing basis. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K
for further information about third-party risk.
Business Resilience Risk.
Business resilience risk is the risk of disruption to our critical processes. We monitor threats and assess risks and seek to ensure our state of readiness in the event of a significant operational disruption to the normal operations of our critical functions or their dependencies, such as critical facilities, systems, third parties, data and/or personnel. We approach BCP through the lens of business and operational resilience. The resilience framework defines the fundamental principles for BCP and crisis management to ensure that critical functions can continue to operate in the event of a disruption. The business continuity program is comprehensive, consistent firmwide and up-to-date,
incorporating new information, techniques and technologies as and when they become available, and our resilience recovery plans incorporate and test specific and measurable recovery time objectives in accordance with local market best practices and regulatory requirements, and under specific scenarios. See “Regulatory and Other Matters - Other Matters” for information about the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic. See “Business - Business Continuity and Information Security” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K
for further information about business continuity.

Model Risk Management
Overview
Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions made based on model outputs that may be incorrect or used inappropriately. We rely on quantitative models across our business activities primarily to value certain financial assets and liabilities, to monitor and manage our risk, and to measure and monitor our regulatory capital.
Model Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units, model developers, model owners and model users, and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our model risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses, and provides periodic updates to senior management, risk committees and the Risk Committee of the Board.
Our model risk management framework is managed through a governance structure and risk management controls, which encompass standards designed to ensure we maintain a comprehensive model inventory, including risk assessment and classification, sound model development practices, independent review and model-specific usage controls. The Firmwide Model Risk Control Committee oversees our model risk management framework.
Model Review and Validation Process
Model Risk consists of quantitative professionals who perform an independent review, validation and approval of our models. This review includes an analysis of the model documentation, independent testing, an assessment of the appropriateness of the methodology used, and verification of compliance with model development and implementation standards.
We regularly refine and enhance our models to reflect changes in market or economic conditions and our business mix. All models are reviewed on an annual basis, and new models or significant changes to existing models and their assumptions are approved prior to implementation.
The model validation process incorporates a review of models and trade and risk parameters across a broad range of scenarios (including extreme conditions) in order to critically evaluate and verify:
•
The model’s conceptual soundness, including the reasonableness of model assumptions, and suitability for intended use;
•
The testing strategy utilized by the model developers to ensure that the models function as intended;
•
The suitability of the calculation techniques incorporated in the model;
•
The model’s accuracy in reflecting the characteristics of the related product and its significant risks;
•
The model’s consistency with models for similar products; and
•
The model’s sensitivity to input parameters and assumptions.
See “Critical Accounting Policies - Fair Value - Review of Valuation Models,” “Liquidity Risk Management,” “Market Risk Management,” “Credit Risk Management” and “Operational Risk Management” for further information about our use of models within these areas.
