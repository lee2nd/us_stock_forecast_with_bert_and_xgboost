ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.
Business Overview and Highlights
We are one of the world's leading pure-play infusion therapy companies with global operations and a wide-ranging product portfolio that includes IV solutions, IV smart pumps with pain management and safety software technology, dedicated and nondedicated IV sets and needlefree connectors designed to help meet clinical, safety and workflow goals. In addition, we manufacture automated pharmacy IV compounding systems with workflow technology, closed system transfer devices for preparing and administering hazardous IV drugs and cardiac monitoring systems for critically ill patients.
COVID-19 Pandemic
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our non-essential offices and facilities, including our corporate headquarters are closed to non-essential employees.
Our manufacturing, distribution, and pump service facilities are operating under our business continuity plan due to the need for our critical healthcare products, however, we have taken certain precautionary measures including the following to maximize the safety of our employees and to mitigate disruption to our operations:
•implemented physical distancing measures;
•enhanced hygiene protocols and increased frequency of cleaning procedures;
•acquired additional personal protective equipment;
•developed contingency plans and protocols to assess employee illness;
•helped employees with childcare issues due to school and daycare closures;
•implemented COVID-19 temperature screening for employees entering our manufacturing and distribution facilities; and
•initiated a visitor pre-entry questionnaire to limit potential exposure in our facilities.
During the first quarter in 2020, as a precautionary measure in response to market uncertainty driven by COVID-19, we preemptively increased our liquidity by borrowing $150.0 million under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility ("Credit Facility"). As 2020 progressed, financial institutions demonstrated adequate liquidity in meeting the funding needs of the market and our internal operations remained stable, as such, we fully repaid the $150.0 million borrowed under our Credit Facility during the third quarter.
During 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw a meaningful decline in demand for our Infusion Consumables non-dedicated sets, a decline in demand for our Infusion Systems dedicated sets and an increase in demand for our Infusion Systems hardware. During 2020, most notably in the first quarter, we also experienced foreign exchange losses related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies as general economic conditions declined in response to COVID-19.
The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic will not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods. The duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be fully predicted at this time, as such, the impact of the pandemic on our future results of operations
and overall financial performance remain uncertain and cannot as yet be quantified. However, our future results could be impacted by the following:
•lost revenue or additional costs associated with either disruptions at our production and distribution facilities or interruptions in our supply chain;
•fluctuations in demand from customers as a result of an increase in COVID-19 patient admissions in hospitals offset by the decline in non-COVID-19 patient admissions;
•healthcare customers that defer the more profitable elective procedures may experience financial difficulties and may be unable to pay within payment terms for the products they purchased;
•potential lower demand in future periods due to over-purchasing of our products due to the COVID-19 pandemic;
•reduced revenue due to delays in implementation of our infusion systems and oncology products at hospital locations due to restricted access;
•higher operating costs related to additional compensation paid to our manufacturing and distribution facility workers;
•volatility in cash flow, revenue and income due to foreign currency fluctuations and volatility;
•lower travel and entertainment costs due to global travel restrictions;
•lower income due to a delay in cost savings projects as a result of the travel and social distancing requirements of COVID-19; and
•lower interest income on cash balances due to reductions in interest rates along with higher interest expense from borrowings under our $150.0 million Credit Facility, if necessary, to maintain adequate liquidity.
Consolidated Results of Operations
The following table summarizes our total worldwide revenue by domestic and international markets by amount and as a percentage of total revenue (in millions, except percentages):
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, total revenue by product line as a percentage of total revenue:
We manage our product distribution in the U.S. through a network of two owned and one leased distribution facilities, as well as, through direct channels, which include independent distributors and the end users of our products, and as original equipment manufacturer suppliers. Most of our independent distributors handle the full line of our products. Internationally, we manage distribution utilizing international regional hubs and through independent distributors.
In the U.S. a substantial amount of our products are sold to group purchasing organization ("GPO") member hospitals. We believe that as healthcare providers continue to either consolidate or join major buying organizations, the success of our products will depend, in part, on our ability, either independently or through strategic relationships to secure long-term contracts with large healthcare providers and major buying organizations. Although we believe that we are not dependent on any single distributor, large healthcare provider or major buying organization for distribution of our products, the loss of a strategic relationship with any one of these organizations or a decline in demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
We believe that achievement of our growth objectives worldwide will require increased efforts by us in sales and marketing and product acquisition and development; however, there is no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our growth strategy. Product development or acquisition efforts may not succeed, and even if we do develop or acquire additional products, there is no assurance that we will achieve profitable sales of such products. Increased expenditures for sales and marketing and product acquisition and development may not yield desired results when expected, or at all. While we have taken steps to control these risks, there are certain risks that may be outside of our control, and there is no assurance that steps we have taken will succeed.
Seasonality/Quarterly Results
There are no significant seasonal aspects to our business. We can experience fluctuations in net sales as a result of variations in the ordering patterns of our largest customers, which may be driven more by production scheduling and their inventory levels, and less by seasonality. Our expenses often do not fluctuate in the same manner as net sales, which may cause fluctuations in operating income that are disproportionate to fluctuations in our revenue.
We present summarized income statement data in Item 6. Selected Financial Data. The following table shows, for the three most recent years, the percentages of each income statement caption in relation to total revenues.
Total revenues for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $1.3 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.
In addition to comparing changes in revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis, we also compare the changes in revenue from one period to another using constant currency. We provide constant currency information to enhance the visibility of underlying business trends, excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency translation rates. To calculate our constant currency results, we apply the average exchange rate for revenues from the prior year to the current year results. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.
Infusion Consumables
The following table summarizes our total Infusion Consumables revenue (in millions, except percentages):
Infusion Consumables revenue decreased in 2020, as compared to 2019. The decrease was mostly driven by overall lower demand for our products due to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by sales from new customers and sales of our ClearGuard HD product, which we acquired in our fourth quarter 2019 acquisition of Pursuit. On a constant currency basis,
Infusion Consumables revenue was comparable at $474.0 million for 2020, as the full year impact of foreign currency was negligible.
Infusion Consumables revenue decreased in 2019, as compared to 2018. The decrease was mostly driven by foreign exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, Infusion Consumables revenue would have been $485.8 million for 2019, an increase of $2.8 million or 0.6%, as compared to 2018.
Infusion Systems
The following table summarizes our total Infusion Systems revenue (in millions, except percentages):
Infusion Systems revenue increased in 2020, as compared to 2019. The increase in revenue was primarily due to high demand for our infusion pumps during the COVID-19 pandemic, offset partially by lower demand for our dedicated infusion sets and losses of our non-core ambulatory pump business. On a constant currency basis Infusion Systems revenue in 2020 would have been $364.7 million, an increase of $36.4 million or 11.1%, as compared to 2019.
Infusion Systems revenue decreased in 2019, as compared to 2018. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to the impact of exchange rates and losses of our non-core ambulatory and patient controlled analgesia pumps business. On a constant currency basis Infusion Systems revenue in 2019 would have been $338.6 million, a decrease of $16.9 million or 4.8%, as compared to 2018.
IV Solutions
The following table summarizes our total IV Solutions revenue (in millions, except percentages):
IV Solutions sales decreased in 2020, as compared to 2019, due to lower contract manufacturing sales to Pfizer and higher sales in the first quarter of 2019 to non-contracted customers.
IV Solutions sales decreased in 2019, as compared to 2018. Supply constraints at our competitors beginning in the second quarter of 2017 and continuing through 2018 caused some temporary customer purchases and stock-up of IV Solutions in 2018. These market shortages temporarily drove up the demand for our product during the latter part of 2017, in 2018 and during the first part of 2019. The temporary increase in IV Solutions sales that we had as a result of competitor supply constraints normalized in mid-2019 as customers returned to their original contract supplier.
Critical Care
The following table summarizes our total Critical Care revenue (in millions, except percentages):
Critical Care revenue increased in 2020, as compared to 2019, primarily as a result of growth in the Asia region and improved manufacturing capacity.
Critical Care revenue decreased in 2019, as compared to 2018, primarily due to manufacturing constraints.
Gross Profits
Gross profits for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were 36.3%, 37.3%, and 40.7%, respectively.
The decrease in gross profit in 2020, as compared to 2019 was primarily due to lower IV Solutions manufacturing volumes and unfavorable product mix as a result of lower demand for our consumables products during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The decrease in gross profit in 2019, as compared to 2018 was primarily due to the slowdown in manufacturing of IV Solutions and additional supply chain costs related to higher than optimal inventory levels. In 2019, we also recorded a one-time supply chain inventory optimization charge of $16.3 million for the initial ramp down of IV Solution production to align supply to market demand.
Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") Expenses
The following table summarizes our SG&A expenses (in millions, except percentages):
Consolidated SG&A expenses increased in 2020, as compared to 2019. Dealer fees increased $9.3 million, depreciation and amortization expense increased $7.1 million, compensation expense increased $5.5 million, and stock compensation increased $2.0 million. Offsetting these expense increases was a $6.3 decrease in bad debt expense, a $6.3 million decrease in travel expenses, a $3.7 million decrease in consulting expenses, and a $2.8 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses. Dealer fees increased due to a change to a distribution model from a direct model in Canada and an increase in revenue from distributors. Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily as a result of the increase in amortization base due to the November 2019 acquisition of Pursuit. Compensation expense increased as a result of lower incentive compensation recognized in the prior year due to results below performance targets. Stock compensation increased in the current year due to a change in the number of performance shares estimated to vest on one of our non-executive performance awards. Bad debt expense is estimated based on an analysis of the expected losses on the accounts receivables at the reporting date, which varies from period-to-period due to the quality of those receivables. Travel expenses decreased in the current year, as compared to prior year, due to travel restrictions in response to COVID-19. Consulting expense was higher in 2019 due to charges incurred related to tax compliance and IT infrastructure expenses. Sales and marketing expenses decreased due to the impact of COVID-19 on trade shows, conferences, and related expenses.
Consolidated SG&A expenses decreased in 2019, as compared to 2018. Consulting expenses decreased $33.9 million, compensation expense decreased $17.9 million, legal expense decreased $3.8 million, marketing expenses decreased $3.4 million, information technology decreased $3.3 million, stock based compensation decreased $3.2 million and travel expenses decreased $2.8 million. Partially offsetting these decreases was a $10.6 million increase in depreciation and amortization and a $7.9 million increase in bad debt and warranty expense. Consulting expenses decreased as our transitional services agreement with Pfizer ended in the fourth quarter of 2018. Compensation expense decreased in the current period as incentive bonuses were higher in the prior year due to company performance. Legal expenses were higher in the prior year due to expenses incurred related to the contract settlement, discussed below. Marketing expenses decreased in the current period as the prior period included additional expenses related to post-acquisition branding efforts. Information technology expenses decreased as software maintenance costs decreased in the current period. Stock based compensation decreased due to an adjustment for changes in the number of performance shares estimated to vest. Depreciation expense increased due to an increase in the depreciable asset base related to the HIS integration. Bad debt expense increased as a result of the quarterly assessment of our reserves related to our accounts receivable.
Research and Development ("R&D") Expenses
The following table summarizes our total R&D Expenses (in millions, except percentages):
R&D expenses decreased in 2020, as compared to 2019, and decreased in 2019, as compared to 2018. R&D expenses are primarily related to compensation and benefit expenses incurred on our R&D projects in progress during each year.
Restructuring, Strategic Transaction and Integration Expenses
Restructuring, strategic transaction and integration expenses were $28.4 million, $80.6 million and $105.4 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Restructuring Charges
In 2020, restructuring charges were $7.9 million. These charges were primarily related to severance and costs related to office and other facility closures. We expect to pay unpaid restructuring charges as of December 31, 2020, in 2021.
In 2019, restructuring charges were $8.4 million. These charges were primarily related to a one-time charge to move our U.S. pump service depot to our existing Salt Lake City facility and other plant restructuring.
In 2018, restructuring charges were $4.5 million. These charges were related to severance costs from the reduction in our workforce as a result of the continued integration of HIS.
Strategic Transaction and Integration Expenses
In 2020, we incurred $20.5 million in strategic transaction and integration expenses primarily related to the integration of HIS, which included the migration of IT systems at our Austin facility.
In 2019, we incurred $72.2 million in strategic transaction and integration expenses primarily related to the integration of the HIS business. Integration expenses included a one-time strategic supply chain restructuring charge of $22.1 million, which reduces our contracted commitments to our third party manufacturer and we incurred charges related to our final Pfizer separation costs and clean-up, which included a $12.7 million non-cash write-off of related assets.
In 2018, we incurred $100.9 million in strategic transaction and integration expenses primarily related to our continued integration of the HIS business and IT systems.
Change in fair value of contingent earn-out
In 2020, the fair value revaluation of our Pursuit contingent earn-out liability resulted in an increase in value of $9.0 million.
In 2019, the fair value revaluation of our HIS contingent earn-out liability resulted in a change in value of $47.4 million reducing the liability balance to zero. The earn-out period ended on December 31, 2019. As of the date of this filing, Pfizer has disputed our determination that the performance targets requiring payout of the HIS earn-out liability were not met. We expect the dispute will be resolved by binding arbitration unless both parties are able to come to an agreement on this issue.
In 2018, the fair value revaluation of our HIS contingent earn-out liability resulted in a change in fair value of $20.4 million.
Contract Settlement
In 2020, we recorded $1.0 million in contract settlement income related to the resolution of a dispute with one of our suppliers. In 2019 and 2018, we incurred a $5.7 million and $41.6 million charge, respectively, related to the resolution of a dispute with a product partner, which resulted in a redefinition of our contractual arrangement and in the rights and remedies determined under such arrangement.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $1.8 million, $0.5 million and $0.7 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In 2020, interest expense was primarily related to borrowings under our five-year Revolving Credit Facility ("Credit Facility") and the amortization of financing costs that were incurred in 2017 in connection with entering into the Credit Facility.
In 2019 and 2018, the interest expense includes the amortization of financing costs and a per annum commitment fee charged on the unused portion of the revolver under such Credit Facility.
Borrowing under the Credit Facility bears interest, at our option, based on the Base Rate (as defined in Note 11 in our accompanying consolidated financial statements) plus applicable margin or the London Interbank Offered Rate plus applicable margin. The per annum commitment fee is based on consolidated total leverage ratio in effect and can range between 0.15% to 0.30% on the unused portion of the Credit Facility (see Note 11, Long-Term Obligations in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information).
Other Income (Expense), net
Other income (expense), net was $1.1 million, $7.9 million and $(6.7) million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2020, the other income, net was primarily related to interest income of $3.7 million, miscellaneous income, net of $2.8 million and gain from the disposal of property, plant and equipment of $1.8 million, which was mostly offset by $7.2 million in foreign exchange losses incurred as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar from the impact of COVID-19 during the first half of the year. In 2019, other income, net was primarily due to interest income of $6.8 million related to our banking and investment accounts. In 2018, other expense, net included $8.1 million of foreign exchange losses and a $3.9 million loss on disposal of or write-off of property, plant and equipment offset by $5.4 million of interest income.
Income taxes
Income taxes were accrued at an estimated annual effective tax rate of 11%, 12% and (29%) in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The effective tax rate in 2020 differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% principally because of the effect of the mix of U.S. and foreign incomes, state income taxes, global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI"), foreign-derived intangible income ("FDII") and tax credits. The effective tax rate in 2020 included a tax benefit of $5.3 million related to the excess tax benefits recognized on stock option exercises and the vesting of restricted stock units during the period. The effective tax rate for 2020 also included U.S. federal and state return-to-provision adjustments net of related reserve changes for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $3.8 million tax benefit primarily due to changes in estimates for GILTI, FDII, and related foreign tax credits.
The effective tax rate in 2019 differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% principally because of the effect of the mix of U.S. and foreign incomes, state income taxes, GILTI and tax credits. The effective tax rate for 2019 included a tax benefit of $9.6 million related to the excess tax benefits recognized on stock option exercises and the vesting of restricted stock units during the period. The effective tax rate for 2019 was also impacted by the repatriation of certain intellectual property and assets from a liquidation of one of our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. parent. In accordance with the changes to the accounting for income tax effects of such intra-entity transfers of assets, we recorded a net tax benefit of $3.8 million related to the liquidation. Lastly, the effective tax rate during 2019 included a tax expense of $2.2 million related to return-to-provision adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to changes in estimates for our U.S. GILTI inclusion.
The effective tax rate in 2018 differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% principally because of the effect of the mix of U.S. and foreign incomes, state income taxes and tax credits. The effective tax rate for 2018 included a tax benefit of $12.6 million related to the excess tax benefits recognized on stock option exercises and the vesting of restricted stock units during the period.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Introduction
Our primary sources of cash are cash flows from operating activities, proceeds from the exercise of employee options and borrowings under our Credit Facility (as defined above). Our primary uses of cash are to meet working capital requirements, finance capital expenditures and acquisitions along with acquisition-related incremental transaction and integration costs.
During 2020, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment securities increased by $118.1 million from $292.6 million at December 31, 2019 to $410.8 million at December 31, 2020. Our cash provided by operations was partially offset by purchases of property and equipment and cash taxes paid by us on behalf of employees related to net share settlement of their equity awards.
Future Cash Flows
Short-term
Our five-year $150 million Credit Facility provides us with fast, flexible funding for future acquisition and operational needs.
Our short-term investment portfolio is invested in corporate bonds and our primary investment goal is capital preservation.
While we can provide no assurances, we estimate that our capital expenditures in 2021 will approximate $75 million to $85 million. We anticipate making additional investments in machinery and equipment in our manufacturing operations in Costa Rica, the U.S. and Mexico to support new and existing products and in infusion pumps that get placed with customers outside the U.S. We expect to use our cash and cash equivalents to fund our capital purchases. Amounts of spending are estimates and actual spending may substantially differ from those amounts.
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents along with funds expected to be generated from future operations will provide us with sufficient funds to finance our current operations for the next twelve months.
Long-term
Our long-term liquidity needs include capital expenditures related to the expansion and maintenance of our business and potential acquisitions in accordance with our growth strategy.
We are unable to project with certainty whether our long-term cash flow from operations and amounts available to us under our Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our future capital expenditures and acquisitions as they arise. In the event that we experience illiquidity in our investment securities, downturns or cyclical fluctuations in our business that are more severe or longer than anticipated or if we fail to achieve anticipated revenue and expense levels, we may need to obtain or seek alternative sources of capital or financing, and we can provide no assurances that the terms of such capital or financing will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all.
Credit Facility
On November 8, 2017, we entered into a five year revolving Credit Facility with various lenders which includes
$150 million in borrowing capacity available for revolving credit loans and may also be used to borrow, on same-day notice under a swingline, the lesser of $10 million and the aggregate unused amount of the revolving credit available. During the first quarter in 2020, as a result of market uncertainty caused by COVID-19, we preemptively increased our liquidity as a precautionary measure by borrowing $150.0 million under our revolving Credit Facility. As 2020 progressed, financial institutions demonstrated adequate liquidity in meeting the funding needs of the market and our internal operations remained stable, as such, we fully repaid the $150.0 million borrowed under our Credit Facility during the third quarter. As of December 31, 2020, we had $150 million of availability under the revolving Credit Facility.
All of our obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by ICU Medical, Inc. and certain of our existing subsidiaries. The obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by a pledge of 100% of the capital stock of certain subsidiaries owned by us and a security interest in substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets and the tangible and intangible assets of each guarantor.
The Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants pertaining to Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage and Consolidated Total Leverage ratios, see below under "Financial Covenants". In addition, the Credit Facility has restrictions pertaining to limitations on debt, liens, negative pledges, loans, advances, acquisitions, other investments, dividends, distributions, redemptions, repurchases of equity interests, fundamental changes and asset sales and other dispositions, prepayments, redemptions and purchases of subordinated debt and other junior debt, transactions with affiliates, dividend and payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries, changes in line of business, fiscal year and accounting practices and amendment of organizational documents and junior debt documents.
Financial Covenants
The Credit Facility contains certain negative financial covenants, including, Consolidated Total Leverage and Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratios.
The Consolidated Leverage Ratio is defined as the ratio of Consolidated Total Funded Indebtedness on such date, to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as defined under the Credit Facility Agreement, for the most recently completed four fiscal quarters. The maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio is not more than 3.00 to 1.00.
The Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is defined as the ratio of: (a) Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA less the sum of (i) capital expenditures, (ii) federal, state, local and foreign income taxes paid in cash and (iii) cash restricted payments made after the closing date, to (b) Consolidated Fixed Charges for the most recently completed four fiscal quarters, calculated on a pro forma basis. The minimum Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is 2.00 to 1.00.
We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of December 31, 2020.
Historical Cash Flows
Cash Flows from Operating Activities:
Our cash provided by operations was $222.8 million in 2020. Net income plus adjustments for non-cash net expenses contributed $239.7 million to cash provided by operations. Net cash used in operations as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities was $17.0 million. The changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $46.4 million decrease in accounts payable, a $29.4 million decrease in accrued liabilities, $18.0 million in net changes in income taxes, including excess tax benefits and deferred income taxes, a $16.1 million increase in other assets, and a $4.3 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. Offsetting these amounts was a $78.0 million decrease in accounts receivable and a $19.2 million decrease in inventories. The decrease in accounts payable was due to the payment of integration-related expenses with extended payment terms and the timing of other payments. The decrease in accrued liabilities was due to the payment of one-time accrued supply chain reorganization costs. The increase in other assets was due to the purchase of spare parts. The net changes in income taxes was a result of the timing of payments. The increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to an increase in deferred costs. The decrease in accounts receivable is primarily due to collection efforts. The decrease in inventory was primarily due to improved inventory management and increased demand for certain products driven by the COVID-19 pandemic at the end of the year.
Our cash provided by operations was $101.9 million in 2019. Net income plus adjustments for non-cash net expenses contributed $213.6 million to cash provided by operations. Net cash used in operations as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities was $111.6 million. The changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $43.7 million decrease in accrued liabilities, a $29.8 million increase in other assets, a $25.0 million increase in inventories, a $23.7 million increase in accounts receivable, and a $2.7 million decrease in accounts payable. Offsetting these amounts was a $8.6 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $4.7 million in net changes in income taxes, including excess tax benefits and deferred income taxes. The decrease in accrued liabilities was primarily a result of the payout of accrued compensation, partially offset by an increase in certain accruals including $22.1 million in accrued costs related to the initial ramp down of IV Solution production. The increase in other assets was primarily related to the purchase of spare parts. The increase in inventory was primarily due to an increase in our finished goods safety stock. The increase in accounts receivable is mainly due to the current year reclassification of receivables from Pfizer and the timing of revenue and collections. In the current year, receivables from Pfizer are included in accounts receivable and not in a separate related-party receivable line item as in the prior year. As of December 31, 2018, Pfizer had sold all of its shares of our common stock thereby ending its related-party relationship with us. The decrease in accounts payable was due to the timing of payments. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to the collection of receivable amounts owed from Pfizer. The net changes in income taxes was a result of the timing of payments.
Our cash provided by operations was $160.2 million in 2018. Net income plus adjustments for non-cash net expenses contributed $192.9 million to cash provided by operations. Net cash provided by operations as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities was $32.7 million. The changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $76.7 million increase in accounts receivable, a $29.6 million decrease in accrued liabilities, a $21.8 million increase in inventories, a $20.0 million in net changes in income taxes, including excess tax benefits and deferred income taxes and a $9.1 million increase in other assets. Offsetting these amounts was a $97.4 million decrease in related party receivables and a $23.3 million increase in accounts payable. The increase in accounts receivable is due to the increase in revenue and timing of collections. The decrease in accrued liabilities was primarily a result of the settlement of contract liabilities. The increase in inventory was primarily due to efforts to build-up the inventory level of certain products. The net changes in income taxes was a result of the timing of payments. The increase in other assets was primarily due to the purchase of spare parts. The decrease in related-party receivables was a result
of the transition services agreement with Pfizer nearing its end. The increase in accounts payable was due to the timing of payments.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
The following table summarizes the changes in our investing cash flows (in thousands):
______________________________
(1) Our purchases of property, plant and equipment will vary from period to period based on additional investments needed to support new and existing products and expansion of our manufacturing facilities.
(2) In 2020, we sold our Farmers Branch, Texas, U.S. distribution facility for $6.0 million.
(3) In 2018, we sold the land and building related to our Dominican Republic manufacturing facilities acquired as part of the 2017 HIS acquisition.
(4) Our business acquisitions will vary from period to period based upon our current growth strategy and our ability to execute on desirable target companies. In 2019, we acquired Pursuit for approximately $75.0 million in cash consideration and we acquired a small foreign distributor for approximately $4.6 million.
(5) Our purchases of investment securities will vary from period to period based on current cash needs, planning for known future transactions and changes in our investment strategy. Our investment policy allows for the purchase of securities with final maturities in excess of one year. If cash is not needed for known future transactions our investment strategy takes advantage of the long-term securities with higher yields. Typically, our longer term securities have maturities up to three years.
(6) Proceeds from the sale of our investment securities will vary based on the maturity dates of the investments.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
The following table summarizes the changes in our financing cash flows (in thousands):
______________________________
(1) During 2020, as a result of market uncertainty caused by COVID-19, we borrowed $150.0 million under our revolving Credit Facility as a precautionary measure to increase liquidity. We had fully repaid all amounts borrowed as of December 31, 2020.
(2) Proceeds from the exercise of stock options will vary from period to period based on the volume of options exercised and the exercise price of the specific options exercised.
(3) In 2020, our employees surrendered 67,041 shares of our common stock from vested restricted stock awards as consideration for approximately $12.9 million in minimum statutory withholding obligations paid on their behalf. In 2019, our employees surrendered 80,186 shares of our common stock from vested restricted stock awards as consideration for approximately $18.6 million in minimum statutory withholding obligations paid on their behalf. In 2018, our employees surrendered 26,307 shares of our common stock from vested restricted stock awards as consideration for approximately $6.3 million in minimum statutory withholding obligations paid on their behalf.
Our common stock purchase plan, which authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of our common stock, was authorized by our Board of Directors and publicly announced in August 2019. This plan replaced our existing plan and has no expiration date. As of December 31, 2020, all of the $100.0 million available for purchase was remaining under the plan. We are currently limited on share purchases in accordance with the terms and conditions of our Credit Facility (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).
Effects of Inflation
We do not believe that inflation and changing prices had a significant impact on our results of operations for any periods presented herein.
New Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the normal course of business, we have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors to the maximum extent permitted under Delaware law and to indemnify customers as to certain intellectual property matters related to sales of our products. There is no maximum limit on the indemnification that may be required under these agreements. Although we can provide no assurances, we have never incurred, nor do we expect to incur, any liability for indemnification.
Contractual Obligations
We have contractual obligations, at December 31, 2020, of approximately the amount set forth in the table below. This amount excludes inventory-related purchase orders for goods and services for current delivery and other open orders for purchases that support normal operations. The majority of our inventory purchase orders are blanket purchase orders that represent an estimated forecast of goods and services. We do not have a firm commitment liability on the blanket purchase orders. We have excluded from the table below pursuant to ASC 740-10-25 (formerly FIN 48), an interpretation of ASC 740-10 (formerly SFAS 109), a non-current income tax liability of $16.4 million due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with the liabilities.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe are reasonable. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on a regular basis and apply our accounting policies on a consistent basis. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, accounts receivable, inventories, property, plant and equipment and related depreciation, and business combinations have the most potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Historically, our estimates, assumptions and judgments relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.
Revenue recognition
We recognize revenues when we transfer control of promised goods to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods. We offer certain volume-based rebates to our distribution customers, which we consider variable consideration when calculating the transaction price. Rebates are offered on both a fixed and tiered/variable basis. In both cases, we use information available at the time and our historical experience with each customer to estimate the most likely rebate amount. We also provide chargebacks to distributors that sell to end-customers at prices determined under a contract between us and the end-customer. Chargebacks are the difference between prices we charge our distribution customers and contracted prices we have with the end customer which are processed as credits to our distribution customers. In estimating the expected value of chargeback amounts for use in determining the transaction price, we use information available at the time, including our historical experience. We also warrant products against defects and have a policy permitting the return of defective products, for which we accrue and expense at the time of sale using information available and our historical experience. Our revenues are recorded at the net sales price, which includes an estimate for variable consideration related to rebates, chargebacks and product returns.
The vast majority of our sales of Infusion Consumables, Infusion Systems, IV Solutions and Critical Care products are sold on a standalone basis and control of these products transfers to the customer upon shipment.
Our software license renewals are considered to be transferred to a customer at a point in time at the start of each renewal period, therefore revenue is recognized at that time.
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables
In certain circumstances, we enter into arrangements in which we provide multiple deliverables to our customers. These bundled arrangements typically consist of the sale of infusion systems equipment, along with annual software licenses and related software implementation services, as well as infusion consumables, IV solutions and extended warranties.
Our most significant judgments related to these arrangements are (i) identifying the various performance obligations and (ii) estimating the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation, typically using a directly observable method or calculated on a cost plus margin basis method. Revenue related to the bundled equipment, software and software implementation services is recognized upon implementation. The transaction price allocated to the extended service-type warranty is recognized as revenue over the period the warranty service is provided.
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value. An allowance is provided for estimated collection losses based on an analysis of the age of the receivable, on specific past due accounts for which we consider collection to be doubtful and based on current receivables where known economic conditions specific to individual significant customers may indicate collection is doubtful. We rely on prior payment trends, financial status and other factors to estimate the cash which ultimately will be received. Such amounts cannot be known with certainty at the financial statement date. We regularly review individual past due balances for collectability. Loss exposure is with international customers for whom normal payment terms are long in comparison to those of our other customers and with domestic distributors. If actual collection losses exceed expectations, we could be required to accrue additional bad debt expense, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results in the period in which the accrual occurs.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out) or net realizable value. We need to carry many components to accommodate our rapid product delivery, and if we overestimate demand or if customer requirements change, we may have components in inventory that we may not be able to use. For finished products in inventory, we need to estimate what may not be saleable. We regularly review inventory and reserve for slow moving items, and write off all items that we do not expect to use in manufacturing, and finished products that we do not expect to sell. If actual usage of components or sales of finished goods inventory is less than our estimates, we could be required to write off additional inventory, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results in the period in which the write-off occurs.
If our excess and obsolete reserve changed by 1% our cost of goods sold and gross margin would be impacted by $0.4 million with no meaningful impact to our gross margin percentage.
Property, plant and equipment/depreciation
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost and depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. The estimates of useful lives are significant judgments in accounting for property, plant and equipment, particularly for molds and automated assembly machines that are custom made for us. We may retire them on an accelerated basis if we replace them with larger or more technologically advanced tooling. The remaining useful lives of all property, plant and equipment are reviewed regularly and lives are adjusted or assets written off based on current estimates of future use. As part of that review, property, plant and equipment is reviewed for other indicators of impairment. An unexpected shortening of useful lives of property, plant and equipment that significantly increases depreciation provisions, or other circumstances causing us to record an impairment loss on such assets, could have an adverse effect on our operating results in the period in which the related charges are recorded.
Business Combinations
The application of the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the use of significant estimates, assumptions and judgments in the determination of the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate the purchase price at the acquisition date.
Although we believe the estimates, assumptions and judgments we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, industry data, information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and assistance from independent third-party appraisal firms, and are inherently uncertain.
Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the tangible and intangible assets we have acquired, and certain liabilities assumed include but are not limited to:
•Inventories - we used the comparative sales method, which estimates the selling price of finished goods and work-in-progress inventory, reduced by estimated costs expected to be incurred in selling the inventory and a profit on those costs. The fair value of inventory is recognized in our statements of operations as the inventory is sold. Based on internal forecasts and estimates of inventory turnover, acquisition date inventory is sold and recognized in cost of goods sold over an estimated period of six months after the acquisition date.
•Property, Plant and Equipment - the fair value estimate of acquired property, plant and equipment is determined based upon the nature of the asset using either the cost approach, the sales comparison approach or the income capitalization approach. The cost approach measures the value of an asset by estimating the cost to acquire or reproduce comparable assets. The sales comparison approach measures the value of an asset through an analysis of comparable property sales. The income approach values the asset based on its earnings potential. The fair value of land was estimated using a sales comparison approach. Land and building improvements were valued using the cost approach. Personal property assets, such as, leasehold improvements, tooling, laboratory equipment, furniture and fixtures, and equipment, computer hardware, computer software, dies and molds were all valued using the cost approach. Transportation equipment and major manufacturing and equipment were valued using the sales comparison method. Construction-in-progress assets were valued based on the cost approach less adjustments for the nature of the assets. The fair value of property, plant and equipment will be recognized in our statements of operations over the expected useful life of the individual depreciable assets.
•Identifiable Intangible Assets - The fair value of the significant acquired identifiable intangible assets generally is determined using varying methods under the income approach. This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows associated with the asset and then adjusts the forecast to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams.
•Earn-out Liability - The fair value of the earn-out liabilities were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for details).
Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
