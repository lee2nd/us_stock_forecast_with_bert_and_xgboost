Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview
On March 2, 2018, we sold substantially all of our assets to Churchill Downs LLC, pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 20, 2017, as amended by the First Amendment thereto dated January 22, 2018. As consideration for the Asset Sale, Buyer paid a purchase price consisting of cash in the amount of approximately $10.8 million (of which approximately $1.3 million was used to pay the outstanding amount under our credit agreement), a subordinated promissory note in the principal amount of approximately $7.4 million, and a 5% equity interest in Buyer’s post-closing ultimate parent company, Churchill Downs Holdings Ltd., a British Virgin Islands business company. Buyer also assumed substantially all of our liabilities.
On September 6, 2018, the Buyer sold certain of its assets, including certain inventory and the Stone & Leigh tradename (the “S&L Asset Sale”) to Stone & Leigh, LLC (“S&L”), which is owned by a group which included Matthew W. Smith, the Company’s former interim Chief Executive Officer. As a part of the S&L Asset Sale, the Buyer assigned to S&L certain of its rights and obligations under the original $7.4 million subordinated secured promissory note issued (the “Original Note”) to the Company in March 2018 as partial consideration for the Asset Sale. In connection with the assignment, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Subordinated Secured promissory note with the Buyer (the “A&R Note”) with a principal amount as of the assignment date of $3.3 million and a new Subordinated Secured Promissory Note with S&L (the “S&L Note”) a principal amount of $4.4 million as of the assignment date.
On February 7, 2019, the Company, Buyer and related parties entered into a Consent, Reaffirmation, and Joinder (the “Consent”) in connection with a new senior credit facility that Buyer expected to enter into with Alterna Capital Solutions, LLC (“Alterna”). Pursuant to the Consent, Buyer paid $180,000 of principal and accrued interest under the A&R Note as provided in the Consent and Buyer delivered a Seconded Amended and Restated Subordinated Secured Promissory Note (the “Second A&R Note”) in favor of the Company. The Second A&R Note has a principal amount of $3,201,536 and remains payable no later than March 2, 2023, at which time the total principal amount is due. Interest on the principal balance of the note continues to accrue daily at an annual fixed rate of 6%. The other terms of the Second A&R Note are substantially the same as those of the A&R Note. The Second A&R Note also remains guaranteed by Stanley Intermediate Holdings LLC, formerly Churchill Downs Intermediate Holdings LLC. Pursuant to the Consent, Buyer’s British Virgin Island parent company has also guaranteed the Second A&R Note.
Pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated February 7, 2019, Buyer’s British Virgin Island parent company repurchased 2,500 shares of its stock held by the Company. The Company no longer maintains an equity interest in Buyer’s British Virgin Island parent company. The Company recorded a gain on the sale of the stock of $120,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
The Company acquired an equity interest in HC Government Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation (“HC Realty”). HC Realty currently owns and operates a portfolio of 20 single-tenant properties leased entirely to the United States of America for occupancy by federal agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Veterans affairs, the Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration & Customs Enforcement, the Social Security Administration and the Department of Transportation. On March 19, 2019, we purchased 300,000 shares of HC Realty’s Common Stock (the “HC Common Stock”) for an aggregate purchase price of $3,000,000 and 200,000 shares of HC Realty’s 10.00% Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the “HC Series B Stock”) for an aggregate purchase price of $2,000,000. On April 3, April 9, and June 29, 2020, the Company entered into subscription agreements with HC Realty, pursuant to which we purchased 100,000, 250,000, and 475,000 shares of Series B Stock, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of $8,250,000. As a result of these purchases, we currently own approximately 36.4% of the as-converted equity interest of HC Realty.
On March 19, 2019, the Company, together with certain other Lenders, entered into a loan agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with HC Realty’s operating partnership, and HCM Agency, LLC, as collateral agent (the “Agent”), pursuant to which the Lenders provided HC Realty’s operating partnership with a $10,500,000 senior secured term loan (the “Initial Term Loan”), of which $2,000,000 was provided by the Company. On August 14, 2020, pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement, HC Realty’s operating partnership repaid the loan in full, including all accrued interest and make whole interest.
On October 31, 2019, the Company entered into a Forbearance Agreement (the “Forbearance Agreement”) with the Buyer pursuant to which the Company has agreed to forbear from exercising its rights and remedies under Second A&R Note until February 24, 2020 or earlier in the event of (i) a default or (ii) breach of the Forbearance Agreement by the Buyer. Under the Forbearance Agreement, the Buyer agreed to pay the Company $220,000 on November 1, 2019 (the “Effective Date”), $200,000 on or before the 30th day following the Effective Date, $150,000 on or before the 60th day following the Effective Date, and $130,000 on or before the 90th day following the Effective Date. As of December 31, 2019, the Buyer had made all scheduled payments under the Forbearance Agreement. The Company collected $750,000 of principal repayments on the Second A&R Note during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.
On February 24, 2020, the Company and the Loan Parties entered into a letter agreement (the “Forbearance Extension Letter Agreement”) extending the outside termination date for the forbearance period under the Forbearance Agreement from February 24, 2020 to February 26, 2020. The other terms and conditions of the Forbearance Agreement remained the same. The forbearance period terminated on February 26, 2020 under the terms of the Forbearance Extension Letter Agreement and Forbearance Agreement.
The Company received prepayments on February 28, 2020 and March 4, 2020 of $200,000 and $350,000, respectively, of the principal amount on the Second A&R Note from the Buyer.
On March 6, 2020, the Company and the Loan Parties entered into a letter agreement (the “Second Forbearance Extension Letter Agreement”) extending, subject to certain conditions, the outside termination date from February 26, 2020 to March 17, 2020. The extension of the outside termination and the effectiveness of the Second Forbearance Extension Letter Agreement is conditioned on Buyer making payments to be applied to the outstanding principal balance of the Second A&R Note of $250,000 on or before March 12, 2020 and $750,000 on or before March 13, 2020. The Second Forbearance Extension Letter Agreement also required Buyer to make an additional $391,970 payment on or before March 17, 2020 which would be applied to the outstanding principal balance of the Second A&R Note. The other terms and conditions of the Forbearance Agreement remained the same.
On March 12 and 13, 2020, the Company received payments from Buyer of $250,000 and $750,000, respectively, pursuant to the Second Forbearance Extension Letter Agreement which payments were applied to the outstanding principal amount of the Second A&R Note.
On March 16, 2020, the Company received payment of $392,000 from the Buyer resulting in satisfaction in full of the Second A&R Note pursuant to the terms of the Forbearance Agreement as amended. As a result of the payments received from Buyer in January, February, and March of 2020 on the Second A&R Note, the Company recognized a gain of $1.3 million on the payoff of the Second A&R Note during the first quarter of 2020.
As a result of these actions taken on the subordinated secured promissory notes, during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 the Company received approximately $2.1 million and $750,000, respectively, of principal repayments on the Second A&R Note. The Company received principal repayments on the S&L note during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 of approximately $58,000 and $1 million, respectively.
On June 19, 2020, the Company raised $12,675,000, the maximum gross proceeds possible, through its rights offering (the “Rights Offering”) which concluded on June 19, 2020. Pursuant to the Rights Offering, the Company distributed non-transferable rights to purchase 19,500,000 shares of its common stock at a purchase price of $0.65 per share to stockholders of record as of May 18, 2020. As a result of the rights offering, the Company issued 19,500,000 new shares of common stock.
The Company continues to pursue acquisition opportunities which will allow us to potentially derive benefit from the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards.
Results of Operations
2020 Compared to 2019
As of December 31, 2020, our sources of income include dividends on HC Common Stock and HC Series B Stock, and interest paid on cash and the subordinated secured promissory note to S&L. The Company believes that the revenue generating from these sources in addition to the cash on hand is sufficient to fund operating expenses for at least 12 months from the date of these financial statements.
The Company generated interest income of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily a result of decreased interest income from the Second A&R Note pursuant to the Forbearance Agreement and payoff of that note in March 2020, decreased interest income from the HC Realty Loan Agreement as a result of the payoff of that note in August 2020, ceasing to accrete interest income on the S&L Note in September 2020, and lower interest rates on our cash deposits. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of $26,000 of cash interest income on our cash deposits and income tax receivable, $249,000 of interest on the S&L Note from S&L, $204,000 of cash interest on the Loan to Affiliate, $25,000 of paid in kind interest income on the Second A&R Note from Buyer and $104,000 of accreted interest income on the fair value adjustment to the S&L Note. The Company generated dividend income of $684,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $157,000 for the prior year. The increase resulted primarily from the April 3, April 29, and June 29, 2020 acquisitions of additional HC Realty Series B Stock. During the three month period ended March 31, 2020, the Company received payments from Buyer of $2 million, in aggregate, pursuant to the Forbearance Agreement, the First Forbearance Extension Letter Agreement, and the Second Forbearance Extension Letter Agreement. The payments were applied to the outstanding principal amount of the Second A&R Note resulting in satisfaction in full of the Second A&R Note pursuant to the terms of the Forbearance Agreement as amended. As a result of the payments received on the Second A&R Note, the Company recognized a gain of $1.3 million on the payoff of the Second A&R Note during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company recorded an impairment loss of $833,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 on the S&L Note as a result of concluding, based on current information and events, including the impact of COVID-19 on S&L’s business and its customers, the Company did not believe it would be able to collect the amount due under the S&L Note and the note was other than temporarily impaired. The Company also recognized a Loss from Affiliate of $0.4 million during both 2020 and 2019 related to the Company’s investment in HC Realty’s common stock that is accounted for under the equity method.
General and administrative expenses of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in legal and professional fees incurred in connection with the Company’s registration statement and amendments with respect to the Rights Offering. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of $570,000 of professional fees, $265,000 of wages, $82,000 of other fees and expenses primarily related to proxy and annual meeting voting and the Company’s registration statement, $78,000 of insurance expense, $83,000 of stock based compensation expense, $40,000 of franchise tax expense, and $184,000 of other operating expenses. Included in these expenses were one-time legal and professional, printing, and other administrative fees during the year ended December 31, 2020 of $372,000 specifically related to the Company’s registration statement and amendments with respect to the completed Rights Offering.
Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was effectively 0% due to our net operating loss carryforwards. Our 2019 effective tax rate was (97.6)% resulting from a tax benefit from unrecognized tax benefits position under FIN 48.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of liquidity include cash on hand, cash interest earned on our cash on hand and the S&L Note and dividends from our HC Realty common and Series B Stock. We expect cash on hand to be adequate for ongoing operational expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of these financial statements. At December 31, 2020, we had $11.4 million in cash and $234,000 in restricted cash. A portion of our unrestricted and restricted cash is currently held in savings accounts earning approximately 0.05%. We also received quarterly dividends on our HC Realty common and Series B Stock at annual rates of 5.5% and 10%, respectively. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a discussion of uncertainties related to COVID-19.
Cash provided by operations was $290,000 in 2020 as compared to $1.4 million in 2019. The decrease was primarily a result of decreased interest income from the Second A&R Note pursuant to the Forbearance Agreement and payoff of that note in March 2020, decreased interest income from the HC Realty Loan Agreement as a result of the payoff of that note in August 2020, and $1.2 million of one-time CDSOA escrow distributions received in 2019. Cash provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of $479,000 of cash interest income received, $165,000 of dividends on our HC Realty common stock, $477,000 of dividends on our HC Realty Series B Stock, and $494,000 of income tax refund offset by $1.6 million of payments to employees and suppliers. The payments to employees and suppliers primarily consisted of $288,000 of wages and payroll expenses to current management, $715,000 of legal and professional fees, $51,000 of proxy and Rights Offering printing and other fees, and $60,000 of insurance premiums.
Cash used by investing activities in 2020 consisted of the Company’s investment in HC Series B Stock of approximately $8.3 million offset by cash principal payments received on the subordinated secured promissory notes of approximately $2.1 million and principal payments on the Loan Agreement of $2.0 million.
Cash provided by financing activities for year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of proceeds from the issuance of the Company’s common stock in the Rights Offering of approximately $12.7 million.
Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (“CDSOA”)
The CDSOA provides for distribution of monies collected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“Customs”) for imports covered by antidumping duty orders entering the United States through September 30, 2007 to eligible domestic producers that supported a successful antidumping petition (“Supporting Producers”) for wooden bedroom furniture imported from China. Antidumping duties for merchandise entering the U.S. after September 30, 2007 have remained with the U.S. Treasury.
There were no distributions of collected duties to the Company in 2020 or 2019.
As the CDSOA distributed monies collected by Customs to eligible domestic producers that supported a successful antidumping petition (“Supporting Producers”), a portion of the proceeds were retained and held in an escrow account in order to fund future expenses (such as professional fees) related to the petition. During the first quarter of 2019, the Supporting Producers group decided, based on the current facts and circumstances of the petition, to disburse the portion of those funds related to the 2013, 2014, and first half of 2015 distributions. The Company’s share of the escrow release was approximately $1.2 million, which we received on March 15, 2019. The group of Supporting Producers expect that any remaining funds held in escrow will be used for future expenses related to the petition. The Company does not expect any future disbursements related to these escrow funds.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”). The amendments in ASU 2016-13 require the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. In addition, ASU 2016-13 amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. The amendment is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022, however early application is permitted for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2016-13 to have a material impact to the financial statements.
Critical Accounting Policies
We have chosen accounting policies that are necessary to accurately and fairly report our operational and financial position. Below are the critical accounting policies that involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Equity Investments - Long-term investments consist of investments in equity securities where our ownership is less than 50% and the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. These investments are classified in “Investment in affiliate” on the balance sheets. Investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting are initially recorded at cost and subsequently increases or decreases the investment by its proportionate share of the net income or loss and other comprehensive income or loss of the investee. For investments that do not have readily determinable fair values, the Company made an accounting policy election for a measurement alternative. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-01, the Company carries these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus any changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.
If the Company believes a decline in market value below cost is other than temporary, a loss is charged to earnings, which establishes a new cost basis for the security. The Company determination of whether an equity investment is other than temporarily impaired incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information. The Company considers a number of factors including, but not limited to, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the length of time expected for recovery, the financial condition of the investee, the reason for decline in fair value, the ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity, and other factors specific to the individual investment.
Note Receivable - In accordance with ASC 810-40-5, upon the sale of substantially all of the assets the Company recorded a gain on the deconsolidation of a group of assets based on the difference between the fair value of the consideration received and the carrying amount of the group of assets. As the Original Note was part of the consideration received, the Company recorded the Original Note at its fair value on March 2, 2018. The fair value of the Original Note was estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using market rates at the acquisition date that reflect the credit and inherent rate-risk inherent in the Original Note. The discount resulting from the fair value adjustment was recorded as a direct reduction to the original principal balance and amortized to interest income using the effective interest method. As of the date of the assignment and transfer from the Buyer to S&L, it was determined that the Original Note was extinguished and therefore both the A&R Note and the S&L Note were measured based on their fair value in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) - Creditors Accounting for Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments. The discounts resulting from the fair value adjustments for the A&R Note and the S&L Note were recorded as a direct reduction to the original principal balance and amortized to interest income using the effective interest method. When impairment is determined to be probable, the measurement will be based on the fair value of the collateral securing the notes. The determination of impairment involves management’s judgment and the use of market and third-party estimates regarding collateral values.
The Company concluded, based on current information and events, including the impact of COVID-19 on S&L’s business and its customers, that the Company did not believe it would be able to collect the amount due under the S&L Note and determined that the note was other than temporarily impaired. The evaluation was generally based on an assessment of the borrower’s financial condition and the adequacy of the collateral securing the S&L Note. Given the facts and circumstances, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $833,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company further ceased accruing interest and accreting interest income on the fair value discount of the S&L Note on the date in the third quarter of 2020 it determined the note was other than temporarily impaired
Variable Interest Entities (“VIE”) - As a result of both the Asset Sale and the S&L Asset Sale, we have a variable interest in two entities that have been determined to be variable interest entities ("VIE"). If we conclude that we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we are required to consolidate it. To determine if we are the primary beneficiary, we evaluate whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology, product supply, operations services, equity funding, financing, and other applicable agreements and circumstances. Our assessments of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our VIE requires significant assumptions and judgments. We have concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary of the two VIEs as we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs’ economic performance and therefore are not required to consolidate these entities.
Interest Income - Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis based on the effective interest rate method to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts.
Deferred taxes - We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities given the enacted tax laws. We evaluate the need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance by assessing whether it is more likely than not that the company will realize its deferred tax assets in the future. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment, including the forecast of future taxable income. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowance are made to earnings in the period when such assessment is made.
In preparation of our financial statements, we exercise judgment in estimating the potential exposure to unresolved tax matters and apply a more likely than not criteria approach for recording tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. While actual results could vary, we believe we have adequate tax accruals with respect to the ultimate outcome of such unresolved tax matters.
Long-lived assets - Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for possible impairment when events indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets, which could result in impairment charges in future periods that would lower our earnings. Our depreciation policy reflects judgments on the estimated remaining useful lives of assets.
Accruals for self-insurance reserves - Accruals for self-insurance reserves (including workers’ compensation and employee medical) are determined based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical payment trends and claims history, actuarial assumptions and current and estimated future economic conditions. These estimated liabilities are not discounted. If actual trends differ from these estimates, the financial results could be impacted. Historical trends have not differed materially from these estimates.
Stock-Based Compensation - We record share-based payment awards at fair value on the grant date of the awards, based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest, over the vesting period. The fair value of stock options was determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of the restricted stock awards was based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. For awards with performance conditions, we recognize compensation cost over the expected period to achieve the performance conditions, provided achievement of the performance conditions are deemed probable.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have transactions or relationships with “special purpose” entities, and we do not have any off-balance sheet financing other than normal operating leases for office space.
