ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
PLAN OF OPERATION
The Company maintains a corporate office in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho. This is the primary administrative office for the Company and is utilized by Board Chairman Lindsay Gorrill and Chief Financial Officer Kelly Stopher.
During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021, the Company commissioned a detailed third-party Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) to redefine the Longstreet Project and to make sure that the assumptions, and resulting economics, relied on to move the leach pad closer to the Main nob justified the change in design. The PEA has been completed and the Company is currently assessing the best strategy to proceed.
The drilling permit granted from the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) in September 2019 remains valid until December 2021. This allows the Company to commence drilling mainly for the Hydrology Study but also enabling drilling of other holes on the Main knob for geochemical analysis. A bond has been obtained and there are no impediments to drilling other than capital constraints. The Company may apply for an extension of the permit.
Page 28 of 56
For the fiscal year ending April 30, 2022, the Company plans to commence the following activities as it prepares to draft its Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”) on the Longstreet Project:
Hydrology Drilling - 2 to 4 holes expected to be sufficient:
Geochemical analysis - design of program for submission to State of Nevada involves some core drilling;
Plan of Operations Development (Mine Plan, Civil Engineering Design)
Assuming the results of the above-referenced activities are favorable, the Company intends to proceed to the preparation of an EIS and plan of operation for the Longstreet project (the “Longstreet Plan”). The eventual objective of the EIS and Longstreet Plan is the issuance, by each respective governing agency, of the necessary mine permits to authorize the construction of, and ongoing operations at, an open pit/heap leach mine at the Longstreet Property.
Approval of the Longstreet Plan is subject to governmental agency review and may require additional remediation activities.
Management believes it can source additional capital in the investment markets in the coming months and years. The Company may also consider other sources of funding, including potential mergers, sale of property, joint ventures and/or farm-out a portion of its exploration properties.
Future liquidity and capital requirements depend on many factors including timing, cost and progress of the Company’s exploration efforts. The Company will consider additional public offerings, private placement, mergers or debt instruments.
Additional financing will be required in the future to complete all necessary steps to apply for a final permit. Although the Company believes it will be able to source additional financing there are no guarantees any needed financing will be available at the time needed or on acceptable terms, if at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional financing when necessary, it may have to delay exploration efforts or property acquisitions or be forced to cease operations. Collaborative arrangements may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain of its mining claims.

For the year ended April 30, 2021, the Company accelerated the payment to Great Basin Resources, Inc. in consideration of a recorded quit claim deed on the Longstreet property claims. Also, for the year ended April 30, 2021, the Company engaged a mining engineering firm for the purpose of authorizing an updated Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) report on the project. The updated PEA is expected to incorporate effects of the recent upward trend in the price of gold and silver. As well, updating costing methods are expected to be incorporated in the PEA. The Company expects to publish the updated PEA during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022. Consequently, total pre-development expense increased $90,372 for the year ended April 30, 2021 compared to the year ended April 30, 2020.
On November 4, 2019, the United States Department of Agriculture-Forest Service approved the Company’s Longstreet Exploration Project which includes drilling of two (2) test holes for water and a monitoring well to determine sufficient water supply for a potential mine at the Longstreet site.
The Company is currently assembling bids from engineering firms for development of a full Plan of Operations and Mine Schedule for development and eventual submission of an application to permit construction of a heap leach mining operation on the Longstreet Property. The Company is also soliciting bids for drilling of monitor and water-course wells on the Longstreet property site to determine suitability for future mining and leach pad operations.

As of April 30, 2021, the Company had cash on hand of $265,944. Since inception, the sole source of financing has been sales of the Company’s debt and equity securities. Star Gold Corp. has not attained profitable operations and its ability to pursue any future plan of operation is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing.
Page 31 of 56
Star Gold Corp. anticipates continuing to rely on sales of its debt and/or equity securities to continue to fund ongoing operations. Issuances of additional shares of Common Stock may result in dilution to the Company’s existing stockholders. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete any additional sales of equity securities or that it will be able arrange for other financing to fund its planned business activities.
The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis, to obtain additional financing as may be required, or ultimately to attain profitability. Potential sources of cash, or relief of demand for cash, include additional external debt, the sale of shares of the Company’s capital stock or alternative methods such as mergers or sale of the Company’s assets. No assurances can be given, however, that the Company will be able to obtain any of these potential sources of cash. The Company currently requires additional cash funding from outside sources to sustain existing operations and to meet current obligations and ongoing capital requirements.
The Company plans for the long-term continuation as a going concern include financing future operations through sales of our equity and/or debt securities and the anticipated profitable exploitation of the Company’s mining properties. These plans may also, at some future point, include the formation of mining joint ventures with senior mining company partners on specific mineral properties whereby the joint venture partner would provide the necessary financing in return for equity in the property.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
The Company has no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to its stockholders.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company has identified certain accounting policies, described below, that are most important to the portrayal of its current financial condition and results of operations. The Company’s significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to the audited financial statements included in this Annual Report.
Asset Impairments
The Company periodically reviews its long-lived assets to determine if any events or changes in circumstances have transpired which indicate that the carrying value of its assets may not be recoverable. The Company determines impairment by comparing the undiscounted net future cash flows estimated to be generated by its assets to their respective carrying amounts. If impairment is deemed to exist, the assets will be written down to fair value.
Mineral Interests
Exploration costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. The Company capitalizes costs for acquiring and leasing mineral properties and expenses costs to maintain mineral rights as incurred. Should a property reach the production stage, these capitalized costs would be amortized using the units-of-production method based on periodic estimates of ore reserves. Mineral interests are periodically assessed for impairment of value, and any subsequent losses are charged to operations at the time of impairment. If a property is abandoned or sold, its capitalized costs are charged to operations.
