Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and notes thereto included herein. In connection with, and because we desire to take advantage of, the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we caution readers regarding certain forward-looking statements in the following discussion and elsewhere in this report and in any other statement made by, or on our behalf, whether or not in future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Forward-looking statements are statements not based on historical information and which relate to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. Forward looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and many of which, with respect to future business decisions, are subject to change. These uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or our behalf. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
Results of operations for the year ended June 30, 2019, and for the year ended June 30, 2018.

Liquidity
If we are not successful in expanding our clientele base, maintaining profitability and positive cash flow, additional capital may be required to maintain ongoing operations. We have explored and are continuing to explore options to provide additional financing to fund future operations as well as other possible courses of action. Such actions include, but are not limited to, securing lines of credit, sales of debt or equity securities (which may result in dilution to existing shareholders), loans and cash advances from our directors or other third parties, and other similar actions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding (if needed), on acceptable terms or at all, through a sale of our common stock, loans from financial institutions, our directors, or other third parties, or any of the actions discussed above. If we cannot sustain profitable operations, and additional capital is unavailable, lack of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our business viability, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Cash Flows
The table below, for the period indicated, provides selected cash flow information:

Cash Flows Used In Operating Activities
We used $216 of cash in operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2019. We used $16,884 in operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2018. The decrease is due to the cessation of operating activities as of December 31, 2018.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
We did not generate nor use any cash from investing activities during the years ended June 30, 2019 or 2018.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
We did not generate or use any cash from financing activities during the year ended June 30, 2019. During the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company received a capital contribution from our officer in the total amount of $9,275.
Management expects to keep operating costs to a minimum until cash is available through financing or operating activities. Management plans to continue to seek, in addition to equity financing, other sources of financing (e.g., line of credit, shareholder loan) on favorable terms; however, there are no assurances that any such financing can be obtained on favorable terms, if at all.
If we are unable to generate profits sufficient to cover our operating costs or to obtain additional funds for our working capital needs, we may need to cease or curtail operations. Furthermore, there is no assurance the net proceeds from any successful financing arrangement will be sufficient to cover cash requirements during the initial stages of the Company’s operations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.
