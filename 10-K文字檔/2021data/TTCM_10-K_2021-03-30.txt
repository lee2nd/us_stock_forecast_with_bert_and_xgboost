Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) provides information for the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. This MD&A should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. See “Forward-Looking Statements” elsewhere in this report.
Overall Performance
We are an early stage internet applications company, engaged in advanced technology and business development in the internet applications space. We have incurred general and administrative costs, marketing expenses and research and development costs since we commenced our current operations in May 2015, against very little revenue.
The Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes that the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. We had negative cash flows from operations of $90,344 and $1,014,724 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, with recurring losses and negative working capital of $3,867,587 and $4,329,297 as at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.
The continuing operations of the Company are dependent upon our ability to raise adequate financing and to commence profitable operations in the future. The Company may raise additional capital through the sale of its equity securities, through an offering of debt securities, or through loans from related parties. We believe that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding may provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. There is no guarantee, however, that the Company will be successful in achieving these objectives.
Results of Operations for the Years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019
Net Comprehensive Loss
The Company realized a net comprehensive loss of $2,874,525 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a net comprehensive loss of $3,388,979 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Revenue and Cost of Sales
The Company recognized $1,015 in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 versus $209 in 2019. The company has two sources of revenues: the online sales platform in which we take a 2% fee for all merchant sales made on the platform and promotional products such a t-shirts. Cost of sales were $371 for the year ended December 31, 2020 versus non in 2019.
Operating Expenses
The Company’s total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1,625,789 compared to $1,171,816 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $453,973, or 39%).
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred general and administrative expenses of $607,274 compared to $617,877 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $10,603 (2%) primarily attributable to increased software development activity offset by decreases in consulting costs . The following table sets out the material components of the Company’s general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Research and development
Research and development costs were $1,014,894 in 2020 versus $553,939 in 2019 owing to increased development activity.
Other Expenses
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a gain of $105,000 on our settlement of the McRae affair (See Note 6 to the financial statements). We had no such gains in the previous year.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we had losses on settlements of debt of $96,993. We had no such losses in the current year.
The Company recorded $1,021,100 of interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2020 versus $568,828 during the previous year. About $400,000 was due to an increase in discount amortization due to the introduction of derivative liabilities associated with the issuance of new convertible notes.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we had $127,031 of losses on conversion of debt. During 2020, we had 37,267 of such losses.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded loss on changes in the value of our derivative liabilities in the amount of $215,812 compared to a loss of $1,426,354 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Other Comprehensive Loss
At each balance sheet date, transactions and balances that are denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars are adjusted to reflect the current exchange rate which may give rise to a foreign currency translation adjustment accounted for as a separate component of stockholders’ equity and included in other comprehensive income. The Company recorded a translation loss of $80,201 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a gain of $1,837 for the year ended December 31, 2019. These amounts are included in the Company’s statement of operations as foreign currency gain (loss) for the respective years.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of the date of this report, the Company has generated only $1,221 in revenue and is not profitable. The Company’s operations to date have been funded primarily by private placements of common stock and convertible notes, as well as by loans from its management and controlling stockholders.
As at December 31, 2020, the Company had $114,527 in cash and $3,982,114 in current liabilities resulting in a working capital deficit of $3,867,587. The Company is not currently able to maintain its operations through its existing cash balances and internally generated cash flows. Moreover, we have determined that the current capital structure of the Company is not adequate to fund its planned growth.
We intend to secure additional capital to fund the Company’s operations through the issuance of common stock, convertible debt instruments and loans from our management. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining the capital the Company requires to achieve its business objectives, or that such capital will be available on acceptable terms. Future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including technology development costs, technology product rollout and support expense and the demand for the Company’s products and services.
Operating Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company used net cash of $910,344 in operating activities compared to $1,014,724 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreased net losses.
The Company’s average monthly cash burn rate was $75,862 during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $84,560 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Subject to the success of the Company’s financing activities, we expect to increase operating activities in the coming year with a concomitant increase in the Company’s monthly burn rate. We will not be able to predict the increase to our burn rate until we have determined the outcomes of our financing activities.
Investing Activities
The Company purchased on hend-held self-positioning white light scanner system during the year ended December 31, 2020. The original cost was $43,447.
Financing Activities
The Company received net cash of $1,125,215 from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020, consisting primarily from the issuance of convertible notes. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we received a net of $1,038,010 from financing activities which, again, we primarily from the issue of convertible notes. We expect to continue our financing activities to fund our operations until such time as the Company’s technologies are commercialized and we generate revenue on a profitable basis.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Critical Accounting Policies
The discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of the Company’s financial statements is critical to an understanding of its financial statements.
We adopted ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. Under this method, the Company follows the five-step model provided by ASC Topic 606 in order to recognize revenue in the following manner: 1) Identify the contract; 2) Identify the performance obligations of the contract; 3) Determine the transaction price of the contract; 4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and 5) Recognize revenue. An entity recognizes revenue for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company’s revenue recognition policies remained substantially unchanged as a result of the adoption of ASC 606, and there were no significant changes in business processes or systems.
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” and subsequent amendments, which replaced existing lease accounting guidance in GAAP and requires lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all in-scope leases with a term of greater than 12 months and requires disclosure of certain quantitative and qualitative information pertaining to an entity’s leasing arrangements. The Company adopted the standard as of January 1, 2019. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations or consolidated statements of cash flows.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We regularly evaluate estimates and assumptions related to the recoverability of long-lived assets, valuation of convertible debentures, assumptions used to determine the fair value of stock-based compensation and derivative liabilities, and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
We adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Accounting Codification Standard No. 820 (“ASC 820), Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. ASC 820 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and accordingly, does not require any new fair value measurements. ASC 820 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, ASC 820 established a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
Level 1 - Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
Level 2 - Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.
The Company’s financial instruments consist principally of cash, amounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities, due to related parties and convertible notes. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of the Company’s cash is determined based on “Level 1” inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. We believe that the recorded values of all of the Company’s other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
We have reviewed the FASB issue Accounting Standards Update, (“ASU”) accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during the period reported and in future periods. The Company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted accounting principles and does not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the corporation’s reported financial position or operations in the near term. The applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of our financial management and certain standards are under consideration.
