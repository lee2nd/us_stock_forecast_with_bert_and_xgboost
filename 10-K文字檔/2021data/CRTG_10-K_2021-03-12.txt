This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. See “Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Report.
Plan of Operation
Background:
On June 22, 2017, the Group filed an Amended Certificate of Incorporation (the “Amendment”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Oklahoma, to (i) change its name from “3DIcon Corporation” to “The Coretec Group Inc.” and to (ii) effect a 1-for-300 reverse stock split. The Name Change and Reverse Split became effective with the State of Oklahoma on June 28, 2017 and with FINRA on June 29, 2017.
The Group was incorporated on August 11, 1995, under the laws of the State of Oklahoma as First Keating Corporation. The articles of incorporation were amended August 1, 2003 to change the name to 3DIcon Corporation. During 2001, First Keating Corporation began to focus on the development of 360-degree holographic technology. On July 15, 2005, the Group entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement (“SRA”) with the University of Oklahoma (the “University” or “OU”), which expired on January 14, 2007, under which they conducted a research project entitled "Investigation of 3-Dimensional Display Technologies”. On February 23, 2007, they entered into an SRA with the University, which expired on March 31, 2010, under which they conducted a research project entitled "3-Dimensional Display Development". The development to date has resulted in multiple new technologies, two working laboratory prototypes (Lab Proto 1 and Lab Proto 2), and eight provisional patents; five of the eight provisional patents have been combined and converted to five utility patents. Under the SRA, the Group has obtained the exclusive worldwide marketing rights to these 3D display technologies.
Coretec’s Technology. Coretec’s underlying technology is based on the production of a high value liquid silicon precursor, cyclohexasilane (“CHS”). A key advantage of CHS is that it remains in liquid form at room temperature and does not convert to a gas until heated above 450°F. CHS is a superior silicon precursor in many ways compared to materials commonly used for manufacturing silicon-based semiconductors and solar cells (monosilane or trichlorosilane) that have much lower boiling points which leads to higher cost handling and shipping. There are several technical advantages of using CHS versus common silicon precursors and one is that the production rate of the silicon-forming step can be increased by a factor of six, and relative to process temperature up to 10X or more, which leads to significant cost savings. We anticipate that CHS will first be used as an alternative to monosilane or trichlorosilane when adding silicon to lithium ion batteries or when used in manufacturing silicon-based semiconductors.
We also see longer term potential in several emerging markets where there are opportunities in the conversion of CHS into nanoparticles and nanowires for use in such emerging, high-growth markets as:
●
Energy storage
●
Solid state lighting
●
Authentication of critical documentation
●
Printable electronics
●
Building-integrated solar energy
Enhancement of CSpace. A key challenge in the development of CSpace® is the development of the material used for the image chamber. The Company has explored a variety of glass alternatives. While progress has been made, it has been concluded that limitations remain, primarily in the weight and cost of a glass medium.
A key virtue of having access to the Coretec IP portfolio of silicon-based materials is that we can now use all of the manufacturing infrastructure and knowledge that is available for optical plastics for the CSpace® image chamber. The benefit to CSpace® is that silicon-based optical plastics can be molded into a broad range of shapes and allow the image chamber to be much lighter and much lower in cost than the glass material we worked with before.
Near-Term Revenue Opportunities. Opportunities for near-term revenue continue to be explored in battery and microelectronic markets. Interest in the use of silicon in Li-ion batteries continues to increase driven by the growing demand for electrical vehicles, the exploitation of mobile electronics, and energy storage systems for backup power and improved efficiency of home and commercial wind and solar systems. Discussions are ongoing with suppliers of Li-ion battery anode materials that are seeking next generation materials to further increase performance while improving lifetime, charging time, safety and reliability. We believe these suppliers will be well positioned to take advantage of the benefits provided by CHS when combined as a liquid with other solid-based materials. While we believe the use of CHS in Li-ion batteries will provide near term revenue, we also continue to explore revenue opportunities in microelectronics and especially those early adopter markets where advanced microelectronics are being developed in lower volumes and with less price sensitivity.
Recent Developments.
On October 4, 2019 the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) and related convertible promissory note with Diversified Alpha Fund of Navigator Global Fund Manager Platform SPC, a Grand Cayman entity (the “Lender”). As of December 31, 2020, there was outstanding principal under the Credit Agreement and related convertible promissory note in the amount of $1,275,000.
On March 2, 2021, the Company entered into the Purchase Agreement with the Investor pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to the Investor in a private placement (i) 23,500,000 Shares, (ii) Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 51,500,000 shares of its common stock, and (iii) the Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 82,500,000 shares of its common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $6,000,000. The combined purchase price for one share of common stock and associated Warrant is $0.08 and for one Pre-Funded Warrant and associated Warrant is $0.0799. The sale of the securities under the Purchase Agreement closed on March 5, 2021.
The Warrants are exercisable for a period of five- and one-half years from the date of issuance and have an exercise price of $0.08 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Warrants for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and similar events. The Investor may exercise the Warrant on a cashless basis if the Warrant Shares are not then registered pursuant to an effective registration statement. The Investor has contractually agreed to restrict its ability to exercise the Warrant such that the number of shares of the Company’s common stock held by the Investor and its affiliates after such exercise does not exceed the Beneficial Ownership Limitation set forth in the Warrant which may not exceed initially 4.99% of the Company’s then issued and outstanding shares of common stock.
The Pre-Funded Warrants have an exercise price of $0.0001 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Pre-Funded Warrants for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and similar events. The Pre-Funded Warrants will be exercisable immediately and may be exercised at any time until all of the Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised in full.
In connection with the Purchase Agreement, the Company entered into the Registration Rights Agreement with the Investor. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company will be required to file the Registration Statement with the SEC to register for resale of the Shares, Warrant Shares and shares issuable upon exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants, within 20 days of the Signing Date, and to have such Registration Statement declared effective within 45 days after the Signing Date in the event the Registration Statement is not reviewed by the SEC, or 90 days of the Signing Date in the event the Registration Statement is reviewed by the SEC.
In support of the Purchase Agreement, the Company entered into an engagement with HCW to act as exclusive agent, advisor or underwriter in any offering of securities by the Company. Compensation to HCW includes 8.0% cash fee of gross proceeds and warrant coverage equal to 8% of the aggregate number of shares of common stock placed in each offering at an exercise price equal to 125% of the offering price per share available over a 5-year term. The Company will also pay HCW (a) a management fee equal to 1.0% of the gross proceeds raised in each Offering; (b) $35,000 for non-accountable expenses (c) up to $50,000 for fees and expenses of legal counsel and other out-of-pocket expenses. The initial term of the agreement is for one month.
The securities above were offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act since, among other things, the transactions did not involve a public offering.
On June 30, 2020, the Company accepted the retirement and resignations of Ron Robinson, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Judith Keating, Corporate Secretary of the Company. Matthew Hoffman, who joined the Company in May of 2020, was appointed CFO and Corporate Secretary effective June 30, 2020.
On June 30, 2020 the Company moved headquarters and operations from Tulsa, Oklahoma to Ann Arbor, Michigan.
On June 25, 2020, the Company entered into a supply agreement with Evonik Operations GmbH to purchase 500 grams of cyclohexasilane, Si6H12 (CHS) for $185,000. The supply agreement will enable the Company to deliver initial quantities of CHS for sales and R&D evaluation to its customer base. The supply agreement is valid until March 31, 2021. The Company paid Evonik Operations GmbH $92,500 on July 20, 2020, to initiate production of CHS, in accordance with the agreement. Delivery is expected during the March and April of 2021, at which time the Company will owe the remaining $92,500.
On October 29, 2020, the Company moved the trading of its securities to the OTCQB, also known as the Venture Market, from OTC Pink market. The fee for listing on the OTCQB market is $12,000 per annum, with a one-time application fee of $2,500. The OTCQB market is the middle tier of the OTC Markets and consists of early-stage and developing U.S. and international companies.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019
Revenue
We did not have revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Research and Development Expenses
The research and development expenses were $151,864 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $148,875 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The approximately $3,000 increase was a result of the approximately $13,000 increase in legal fees related to CHS intellectual property and approximately $10,000 decrease in consultant compensation cost in 2020.
General and Administrative Expenses
Our general and administrative expenses were $1,029,136 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $1,418,203 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The approximately $389,000 net decrease was largely a result of a reduction in stock option expense of approximately $599,000. Stock option expense included in the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $125,000 compared with the approximately $724,000 of option expense incurred for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other significant decreases during the year ended December 31, 2020 include approximately $33,000 in labor costs, approximately $7,000 in accounting and audit fees and approximately $6,000 in travel expenses.
These reductions were offset for the year ended December 31, 2020 by increases of approximately $67,000 in sales consultant fees and approximately $53,000 in public relations and marketing consultants both of which were driven by the Company’s focus on initial CHS production and sales in 2021. Additional increases for the year ended December 31, 2020 include finance and administrative consultant expenses of approximately $48,000 and increases in legal fees of approximately $31,000 both of which resulted from activities for potential reverse mergers, funding opportunities, and chief financial officer transition. The Company also incurred increases of approximately $22,000 related to the market elevation from OTC Pink to OTCQB and increased transfer agent fees driven by the volume of stock activity. The Company also recognized increases of approximately $18,000 for insurance expenses as a result of Director and Officer premium increases and approximately $9,000 in IT, software and office supplies due to the staff increases and overall business activity.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $665,232 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $287,307 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of approximately $378,000 was a net result of the approximate $647,000 increase in interest expense and amortization of warrant debt cost, beneficial conversion feature and deferred costs of the Diversified Alpha Fund debt activity during 2020 and the decrease, absence, of approximately $269,000 interest expense of various notes fully paid during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
Management remains focused on controlling cash expenses. We recognize our limited cash resources and plan our expenses accordingly. We intend to leverage stock-for-services wherever possible. The 2021 fiscal year operating budget consists of the following expenses:
●
Initial production of CHS for sale and evaluation by customer base and research institutes
●
Research and development costs for CHS sponsored research activities, Chief Technological consultant and costs related to strengthening our patent portfolio
●
Sales consulting staff to support CHS customer relationships
●
Chief Marketing consultant, marketing outreach and public relations firm to bolster the Company’s message and digital platform
●
General and administrative expenses: Chief Executive and Chief Financial officer expenses, salaries, insurance, investor related expenses, rent, travel, website, etc.
●
Professional fees for accounting and audit; legal services for securities and financing
As of December 31, 2020, we had net cash of $22,219 and a negative working capital of $240,417.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we used $1,352,902 of cash for operating activities, an increase of $740,443 or 121% compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
The increase in the use of cash for operating activities was a net result of the decrease in the loss from operations of $9,403, the increase in amortization of debt discount of $516,252, the increase in common stock issued for services of $22,171, the decrease in the options issued for services of $673,135, the decrease in common stock issued for interest of $225,664, the increase in the change in prepaid expenses of $38,298, the increase in the change in deposits of $15,371 and a decrease in the change in accounts payable of $335,171.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, there was $1,316,972 of cash provided by financing activities, an increase of $650,365 or 98% compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was the net result of an increase in proceeds from debt and warrants issued of $580,178 and the $70,187 decrease in payments of notes payable.
As a result of the March 2, 2021, private placement stock purchase agreement, we will fund the ongoing operations through the existing financing in place. Raising additional funds for future activities could be achieved through a potential reverse merger arrangement or an additional financing partnership. Our ability to fund the future operations of the Company is highly dependent on the underlying stock price of the Company.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not engage in any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our consolidated financial condition, revenues, and results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures.
