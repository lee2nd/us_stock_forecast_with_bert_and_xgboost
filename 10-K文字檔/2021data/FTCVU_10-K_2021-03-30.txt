Overview
We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more target businesses. We intend to complete our business combination using cash from the proceeds of the initial public offering and the sale of the placement units that occurred simultaneously with the completion of the initial public offering, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.
We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a business combination will be successful.
Recent Developments
On March 16, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with eToro Group Ltd., a company organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“eToro”), Buttonwood Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of eToro (“Merger Sub”), and the Company, which provides for, among other things, the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of eToro (the “Business Combination”). At the closing of the Business Combination and the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), the stockholders of the Company will receive certain of the common shares, no par value, of eToro (“eToro Common Shares”), and eToro will list as a publicly traded company on Nasdaq and will continue to conduct the social trading platform business conducted by eToro prior to the Business Combination.
Results of Operations
We have neither engaged in any operations (other than searching for a Business Combination after our Initial Public Offering) nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from April 22, 2019 (inception) through December 31, 2020 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below, and, after the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for an initial Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business Combination. We expect to generate non-operating income in the form of interest earned on investments held after the Initial Public Offering. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a net loss of $104,184, which consists of operating costs of $105,760, offset by interest income on investments held in the Trust Account of $1,576.
For the period from April 22, 2019 (inception) through December 31, 2019, we had a net loss of $1,425, which consists of operating costs of $1,425.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
On December 8, 2020, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 25,000,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the Class A common stock included in the Units sold, the “Public Shares”), which includes the partial exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 3,200,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $250,000,000.
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 640,000 units (the “Private Placement Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit in a private placement to FinTech Investor Holdings V, LLC, that closed simultaneously with the Initial Public Offering, generating gross proceeds of $6,400,000. The manager of FinTech Investor Holdings V, LLC is Cohen Sponsor Interests V, LLC.
Transaction costs amounted to $15,461,590, consisting of $4,360,000 in cash underwriting fees, $10,640,000 of deferred underwriting fees and $461,590 of other offering costs. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, cash of $1,054,211 was held outside of the Trust Account and is available for working capital purposes.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in operating activities was $548,774. Net loss of $104,184 was affected by interest earned on investments held in the Trust Account of $1,576, payments of operating costs through promissory notes of $425, and changes in operating assets and liabilities, which used $443,439 of cash from operating activities.
For the period from April 22, 2019 (inception) through December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0. Net loss of $1,425 was affected by formation costs and expenses paid by sponsor, which provided $1,425 of cash from operating activities.
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and investments held in the Trust Account of $250,001,576. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account to complete our Business Combination. We may withdraw interest to pay taxes. During the period ended December 31, 2020, we did not withdraw any interest income from the Trust Account. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.
As of December 31, 2020, we had $1,054,211 of cash held outside of the Trust Account. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination.
In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, members of the Company’s management team or any of their respective affiliates or other third parties may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (“Working Capital Loans”), which will be repaid only upon the consummation of a Business Combination. If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination, the Company may use a portion of any funds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans; however, no proceeds from the Trust Account may be used for such repayment. If such funds are insufficient to repay the Working Capital Loans, the unpaid amounts would be forgiven. The Working Capital Loans may be converted into units at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. The units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. At December 31, 2020, no such Working Capital Loans were outstanding.
We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our Business Combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon consummation of our Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our Business Combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. In addition, following our Business Combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations.
Off-balance sheet financing arrangements
We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.
Contractual obligations
We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay the sponsor or an affiliate of the sponsor a monthly fee of $20,000 for office space, utilities, and shared personnel support services. We began incurring these fees on December 4, 2020 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the business combination or the Company’s liquidation.
Pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into on December 3, 2020, the holders of the founder shares, placement units (including securities contained therein) and the units that may be issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans (and any shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the placement warrants or the warrants included in the units issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans) will be entitled to registration rights requiring us to register such securities for resale (in the case of the founder shares, only after conversion to Class A common stock). The holders of these securities will be entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders will have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of a business combination and rights to require us to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., as representative of the several underwriters, is entitled to a deferred fee of $10,640,000. The deferred fee will become payable to the representative from the amounts held in the trust account solely in the event that the Company completes a business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies.
Class A Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption
We account for our Class A common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Shares of Class A common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. Our Class A common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, shares of Class A common stock subject to possible redemption are presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheet.
Net Income (Loss) per Common Share
We apply the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Net income per common share, basic and diluted for Class A redeemable common stock is calculated by dividing the interest income earned on the Trust Account, net of applicable franchise and income taxes, by the weighted average number of shares of Class A redeemable common stock outstanding for the period. Net loss per common share, basic and diluted for Class A and Class B non-redeemable common stock is calculated by dividing net income less income attributable to Class A redeemable common stock, by the weighted average number of shares of Class A and Class B non-redeemable common stock outstanding for the period presented.
Recent Accounting Standards
Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements.
