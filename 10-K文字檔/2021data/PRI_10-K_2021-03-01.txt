ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the financial condition and results of operations of Primerica, Inc. (the “Parent Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, “we”, “us” or the “Company”) for the three-year period ended December 31, 2020. As a result, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that are included herein. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that constitute our plans, estimates and beliefs. These forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those discussed in “Risk Factors”. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
This section generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and comparisons between 2020 and 2019 financial results. Discussions of 2018 items and comparisons between 2019 and 2018 financial results can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (the “2019 MD&A”).

Business Trends and Conditions
The relative strength and stability of financial markets and economies in the United States and Canada affect our growth and profitability. Our business is, and we expect will continue to be, influenced by a number of industry-wide and product-specific trends and conditions. Economic conditions, including unemployment levels and consumer confidence, influence investment and spending decisions by middle-income consumers, who are generally our primary clients. These conditions and factors also impact prospective recruits’ perceptions of the business opportunity that becoming a sales representative offers, which can drive or dampen recruiting. Consumer spending and borrowing levels affect how consumers evaluate their savings and debt management plans. In addition, interest rates and equity market returns impact consumer demand for the savings and investment products we distribute. Our customers’ perception of the strength of the capital markets may influence their decisions to invest in the investment and savings products we distribute. The financial and distribution results of our operations in Canada, as reported in U.S. dollars, are affected by changes in the currency exchange rate. As a result, changes in the Canadian dollar exchange rate may significantly affect the result of our business for all amounts translated and reported in U.S. dollars.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, market conditions changed rapidly due to the impact of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 (“COVID-19”) pandemic. Measures taken to combat the spread of COVID-19 led to economic uncertainty and market volatility in the United States and Canada that will continue to impact our business for an uncertain period of time. To date, this economic decline, partial recovery and continued uncertainty have resulted in elevated unemployment rates, lower household income, sharp fluctuations in consumer spending, and historic levels of government stimulus. In addition, market volatility has led to large fluctuations in the fair value of securities held in our invested asset portfolio. The impact on our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020 caused by the spread of COVID-19 is discussed in more detail later in this section, the Results of Operations section, and the Financial Condition section.
Due to the evolving and uncertain nature of this event, it currently is not possible to estimate the impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business in future periods. However, we believe COVID-19 will continue to create uncertainty in the following business trends and conditions:
•
The ability of new recruits to obtain the requisite licenses to sell our products has been, and will likely continue to be limited, by the availability of licensing jurisdictions to administer exams and maintain licensing operations.
•
We have experienced and will continue to experience an increase in mortality expense due to premature deaths of our insureds caused by COVID-19 infections. The ultimate mortality expense due to COVID-19 is unknown. Any increase in mortality expense will be mitigated by reinsurance as we have ceded a significant majority of our mortality risk to reinsurers we believe to be creditworthy.
•
To date, the impact of COVID-19 has led to historically high levels of persistency throughout all policy durations and increased policy sales as a result of strong public sentiment towards owning life insurance products. It is unknown how long these trends will continue and to what extent persistency levels and policy sales will normalize as the current fear associated with the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. Also, the prolonged impact of elevated unemployment and lower household income may cause deterioration in persistency of existing term life insurance policies. Refer to the Factors Affecting Our Results section for more information about how persistency impacts our
financial results.
The effects of these trends and conditions are discussed below and in the Results of Operations section.
Size of the Independent Sales Force. Our ability to increase the size of the independent sales force (“sales representatives” or “sales force”) is largely based on the success of the sales force’s recruiting efforts as well as training and motivating recruits to get licensed to sell life insurance. We believe that recruitment and licensing levels are important to sales force trends, and growth in recruiting and licensing is usually indicative of future growth in the overall size of the sales force. Recruiting changes do not always result in commensurate changes in the size of the licensed sales force because new recruits may obtain the requisite licenses at rates above or below historical levels.
Details on new recruits activity and life-licensed sales representative activity were as follows:
New recruits increased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to positive recruiting momentum at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic combined with the effect of offering discounted business application fees for several months during the year. After the discounted fee offerings expired in July 2020, recruiting momentum remained strong through December 2020. The number of new life-licensed sales representatives increased in 2020, but faced challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic that included the suspensions of in-person licensing preparation classes and the closing of licensing examination centers. In order to address these challenges, we enhanced current incentive programs that encourage recruits to complete the licensing process, expanded the reach of online offerings for licensing exam preparation and facilitated the use of remote testing where offered. As examination centers have reopened, we have noted delays in available testing dates due to the backlog that accumulated during COVID-19 related closures. In response to this backlog, many states are issuing temporary licenses and are offering remote testing options. In addition, many states are extending renewal dates to allow licensees adequate time to complete the renewal process.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had 134,907 independent life-licensed representatives compared to 130,522 at December 31, 2019. The number of independent life-licensed representatives at year end included 3,597 individuals with COVID-19 temporary licenses and 2,508 licenses with extended renewals dates. We estimate that approximately 4,200 of these individuals will either not pursue the steps necessary to obtain a permanent license or not renew an expiring license.
Term Life Insurance Product Sales and Face Amount In Force. The average number of life-licensed sales representatives and the number of term life insurance policies issued, as well as the average monthly rate of new policies issued per life-licensed sales representative (historically between 0.18 and 0.22), were as follows:
New policies issued during 2020 increased significantly compared to 2019 as a result of continued favorable public sentiment for protection products in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The ability of life-licensed representatives to adopt virtual communication tools, when combined with extensive point-of-sales technologies and existing products, allowed them to readily meet our client’s needs. These factors drove productivity in 2020 to the high end of our historical range. While sales of new policies were strong in 2020, the effect of continued weakness in household income caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and a change in public sentiment that is less favorable to protection products following the pandemic could adversely impact sales in future periods.
The changes in the face amount of our in-force book of term life insurance policies were as follows:
*
Less than 1%.
The face amount of term life policies in force increased from 2019 to 2020 as the level of face amount issued continued to exceed the face amount terminated. As a percentage of the beginning face amount in force, issued face amount increased while terminated face amount decreased, highlighting the strong demand for both buying and maintaining protection products in 2020. Our average issued face amount per policy decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 to approximately $240,600 from $248,500 primarily due to the increased use of TermNow, our rapid issue term life product that provides for face amounts up to $300,000. A lower percentage of applicants purchased our traditionally-underwritten product in response to challenges in satisfying paramedical underwriting requirements due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Investment and Savings Product Sales, Asset Values and Accounts/Positions. Investment and savings products sales and average client asset values were as follows:
*
Less than 1%.
The rollforward of asset values in client accounts was as follows:
*
Less than 1%.
Average number of fee-generating positions was as follows:
(1)
We receive transfer agent recordkeeping fees by mutual fund positions. An individual client account may include multiple mutual fund positions. We may also receive fees, which are earned on a per account basis, for custodial services that we provide to clients with retirement plan accounts that hold positions in these mutual funds.
Product sales. The increase in investment and savings product sales in 2020 from 2019 was due to a combination of strong demand for mutual funds and, to a lesser degree, higher sales of managed accounts as a result of continued equity market recovery following the negative market reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. This was partially offset by lower sales of fixed and variable
annuity products, which experienced lower demand as product providers offered less attractive benefits due to the historically low interest rate environment.
Average client asset values. Average client asset values increased as of December 31, 2020 from December 31, 2019 despite market volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the first quarter of 2020, market volatility led to a significant decline in client asset values primarily due to market reaction and economic uncertainty associated with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. After the initial decline, equity markets recovered and expanded, which led to average client asset values being higher than the prior year. Also contributing to the increase were continued higher inflows and lower redemption activity in 2020 compared to 2019.
Rollforward of client asset values. Ending client asset values increased in 2020 from 2019, which was largely attributable to overall market appreciation experienced during 2020 as market values recovered from lows in the first quarter of 2020 and proceeded to increase to levels higher than the pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Also contributing to the increases was lower redemption activity in 2020 as clients opted to hold investments in the face of market volatility, and higher net sales of mutual funds and managed accounts.
Average number of fee-generating positions. The average number of fee-generating positions increased in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to the cumulative effect of retail mutual fund sales in recent periods that led to an increase in the number of retail mutual fund positions serviced on our transfer agent recordkeeping platform.
Significant regulatory changes.
Standards of care. On June 5, 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) adopted rules and interpretations addressing the standards of conduct applicable to broker-dealers and investment advisers and their associated persons (collectively, the “SEC Rulemaking”). Among other things, the SEC Rulemaking: (i) creates a new “best interest” standard of conduct for broker-dealers (“Reg BI”), and (ii) imposes new disclosure requirements through summary forms intended to clarify relationships among brokers, advisers, and their retail customers (“Form CRS”). The SEC Rulemaking had a compliance date of June 30, 2020 for Reg BI and Form CRS. We made certain changes to our sales processes, policies, and procedures in order to comply with the SEC Rulemaking. While we acknowledge that its higher standards of care and enhanced obligations increase regulatory and litigation risk, the SEC Rulemaking has not caused significant disruption to our business.
On December 15, 2020, the Department of Labor (“DOL”) published an interpretation of, and class exemption regarding, the rules governing fiduciary investment advice with respect to Individual Retirement Accounts (“IRAs”) and other retirement accounts (the “DOL Rule”). The effective date of the DOL Rule is February 16, 2021 and the DOL extended its non-enforcement policy through December 20, 2021. The DOL Rule in its current form imposes a higher standard of care and enhanced obligations that increase regulatory and litigation risk to our business.
In addition to federal regulators, certain states have proposed or passed laws or proposed or issued regulations requiring investment advisers, broker-dealers, and/or insurance agents to meet fiduciary standards or standards of care that their advice be in the customer’s best interest, and to mitigate and disclose conflicts of interest to consumers of investment and insurance products. The severity of the impact that such state laws or regulations could have on our business vary from state to state depending on the content of the legislation or regulation and how it would be applied by state regulators and interpreted by the courts, but such laws or regulations could disrupt our brokerage or advisory businesses in the relevant state. We cannot quantify the financial impact, if any, of any changes to our business that may be necessary in order to comply with such laws or regulations at this time.
Restrictions on compensation models in Canada. On February 20, 2020, the organization of provincial and territorial securities regulators (collectively referred to as the “Canadian Securities Administrators” or “CSA”) published final rule amendments, applicable in all provinces except Ontario, to prohibit upfront sales commissions by fund companies for the sale of mutual funds offered under a prospectus in Canada (“DSC Ban”). The final amendments have an effective date of June 1, 2022. The CSA indicated that the participating provinces’ prohibition of upfront sales commissions by fund companies will require firms to discontinue the use of the mutual fund deferred sales charge compensation model, which is the primary model for the mutual funds we distribute in Canada. These rules will result in changes in compensation arrangements with both the fund companies that offer the mutual fund products we distribute and sales representatives in the participating provinces. The deferred sales charge compensation model is permitted to be used until the effective date. While Ontario has disagreed with the prohibition of upfront sales commissions by fund companies and is not at this time participating in adoption of the DSC Ban, the Ontario Securities Commission has proposed several restrictions on the use of the deferred compensation model, including a $50,000 maximum account size and a limitation on the maximum term of the deferred sales charge schedule to three years compared to current industry practice where the maximum term can be up to seven years. These restrictions, if any, will also be effective June 1, 2022. We have not finished the process of determining the types of changes we will make in response to the DSC Ban and the restrictions in Ontario, therefore, we are unable to quantify the potential impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
Factors Affecting Our Results
Term Life Insurance Segment. Our Term Life Insurance segment results are primarily driven by sales volumes, how closely actual experience matches our pricing assumptions, terms and use of reinsurance, and expenses.
Sales and policies in force. Sales of term policies and the size and characteristics of our in-force book of policies are vital to our results over the long term. Premium revenue is recognized as it is earned over the term of the policy, and eligible acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized ratably with the level premiums of the underlying policies. However, because we incur significant cash
outflows at or about the time policies are issued, including the payment of sales commissions and underwriting costs, changes in life insurance sales volume in a period will have a more immediate impact on our cash flows than on revenue and expense recognition in that period.
Historically, we have found that while sales volume of term life insurance products between fiscal periods may vary based on a variety of factors, the productivity of sales representatives generally remains within a range (i.e., an average monthly rate of new policies issued per life-licensed sales representative between 0.18 and 0.22). The volume of our term life insurance products sales will fluctuate in the short term, but over the longer term, our sales volume generally correlates to the size of the independent sales force.
Pricing assumptions. Our pricing methodology is intended to provide us with appropriate profit margins for the risks we assume. We determine pricing classifications based on the coverage sought, such as the size and term of the policy, and certain policyholder attributes, such as age and health. In addition, we generally utilize unisex rates for our term life insurance policies. The pricing assumptions that underlie our rates are based upon our best estimates of mortality, persistency, disability, and interest rates at the time of issuance, sales force commission rates, issue and underwriting expenses, operating expenses and the characteristics of the insureds, including the distribution of sex, age, underwriting class, product and amount of coverage. Our results will be affected to the extent there is a variance between our pricing assumptions and actual experience.
•
Persistency. Persistency is a measure of how long our insurance policies stay in force. As a general matter, persistency that is lower than our pricing assumptions adversely affects our results over the long term because we lose the recurring revenue stream associated with the policies that lapse. Determining the near-term effects of changes in persistency is more complicated. When actual persistency is lower than our pricing assumptions, we must accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (“DAC”). The resultant increase in amortization expense is offset by a corresponding release of reserves associated with lapsed policies, which causes a reduction in benefits and claims expense. The future policy benefit reserves associated with any given policy will change over the term of such policy. As a general matter, future policy benefit reserves are lowest at the inception of a policy term and rise steadily to a peak before declining to zero at the expiration of the policy term. Accordingly, depending on when the lapse occurs in relation to the overall policy term, the reduction in benefits and claims expense may be greater or less than the increase in amortization expense, and, consequently, the effects on earnings for a given period could be positive or negative. Persistency levels will impact results to the extent actual experience deviates from the persistency assumptions that are locked-in at time of issue.
•
Mortality. Our profitability will fluctuate to the extent actual mortality rates differ from the assumptions that are locked-in at time of issue. We mitigate a significant portion of our mortality exposure through reinsurance.
•
Disability. Our profitability will fluctuate to the extent actual disability rates, including recovery rates for individuals currently disabled, differ from the assumptions that are locked-in at the time of issue or time of disability.
•
Interest Rates. We use an assumption for future interest rates that initially reflects the portfolio’s current reinvestment rate gradually increasing over seven years to a level consistent with our expectation of future yield growth. Both DAC and the future policy benefit reserve liability increase with the assumed interest rate. Since DAC is higher than the future policy benefit reserve liability in the early years of a policy, a lower assumed interest rate generally will result in lower profits. In the later years, when the future policy benefit reserve liability is higher than DAC, a lower assumed interest rate generally will result in higher profits. These assumed interest rates, which like other pricing assumptions are locked-in at issue, impact the timing but not the aggregate amount of DAC and future policy benefit reserve changes. We allocate net investment income generated by the investment portfolio to the Term Life Insurance segment in an amount equal to the assumed net interest accreted to the segment’s U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”)-measured future policy benefit reserve liability less DAC. All remaining net investment income, and therefore the impact of actual interest rates, is attributed to the Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment.
Reinsurance. We use reinsurance extensively, which has a significant effect on our results of operations. We have generally reinsured between 80% and 90% of the mortality risk on our term life insurance (excluding coverage under certain riders) on a quota share yearly renewable term (“YRT”) basis. To the extent actual mortality experience is more or less favorable than the contractual rate, the reinsurer will earn incremental profits or bear the incremental cost, as applicable. In contrast to coinsurance, which is intended to eliminate all risks (other than counterparty risk of the reinsurer) and rewards associated with a specified percentage of the block of policies subject to the reinsurance arrangement, the YRT reinsurance arrangements we enter into are intended only to reduce volatility associated with variances between estimated and actual mortality rates.
In 2010, as part of our corporate reorganization and the initial public offering of our common stock, we entered into significant coinsurance transactions (the “IPO coinsurance transactions”) with entities then affiliated with Citigroup, Inc. (collectively, the “IPO coinsurers”) and ceded between 80% and 90% of the risks and rewards of our term life insurance policies that were in force at year-end 2009. We administer all such policies subject to these coinsurance agreements. Policies reaching the end of their initial level term period are no longer ceded under the IPO coinsurance transactions.
The effect of our reinsurance arrangements on ceded premiums and benefits and expenses on our statement of income follows:
•
Ceded premiums. Ceded premiums are the premiums we pay to reinsurers. These amounts are deducted from the direct premiums we earn to calculate our net premium revenues. Similar to direct premium revenues, ceded coinsurance premiums remain level over the initial term of the insurance policy. Ceded YRT premiums increase over the period that the policy has been in force. Accordingly, ceded YRT premiums generally constitute an increasing percentage of direct premiums over the policy term.
•
Benefits and claims. Benefits and claims include incurred claim amounts and changes in future policy benefit reserves. Reinsurance reduces incurred claims in direct proportion to the percentage ceded. Coinsurance also reduces the change in future policy benefit reserves in direct proportion to the percentage ceded, while YRT reinsurance does not significantly impact the change in these reserves.
•
Amortization of DAC. DAC, and therefore amortization of DAC, is reduced on a pro-rata basis for the coinsured business, including the business reinsured with the IPO coinsurers. There is no impact on amortization of DAC associated with our YRT contracts.
•
Insurance expenses. Insurance expenses are reduced by the allowances received from coinsurance. There is no impact on insurance expenses associated with our YRT contracts.
We may alter our reinsurance practices at any time due to the unavailability of YRT reinsurance at attractive rates or the availability of alternatives to reduce our risk exposure. We presently intend to continue ceding approximately 90% of our U.S. and Canadian mortality risk on new business.
Expenses. Results are also affected by variances in client acquisition, maintenance and administration expense levels.
Investment and Savings Products Segment. Our Investment and Savings Products segment results are primarily driven by sales, the value of assets in client accounts for which we earn ongoing management, marketing and support, and distribution fees, and the number of transfer agent recordkeeping positions and non-bank custodial fee-generating accounts we administer.
Sales. We earn commissions and fees, such as dealer re-allowances and marketing and distribution fees, based on sales of mutual fund products and annuities. Sales of investment and savings products are influenced by the overall demand for investment products in the United States and Canada, as well as by the size and productivity of the independent sales force. We generally experience seasonality in our Investment and Savings Products segment results due to our high concentration of sales of retirement account products. These accounts are typically funded in February through April, coincident with our clients’ tax return preparation season. While we believe the size of the independent sales force is a factor in driving sales volume in this segment, there are a number of other variables, such as economic and market conditions, which may have a significantly greater effect on sales volume in any given fiscal period.
Asset values in client accounts. We earn marketing and distribution fees (trail commissions or, with respect to U.S. mutual funds, 12b-1 fees) on mutual fund and annuity assets in the United States and Canada. In the United States, we also earn investment advisory and administrative fees on assets in managed investments. In Canada, we earn management fees on certain mutual fund assets and on the segregated funds for which we serve as investment manager. Asset values are influenced by new product sales, ongoing contributions to existing accounts, redemptions and the change in market values in existing accounts. While we offer a wide variety of asset classes and investment styles, our clients’ accounts are primarily invested in equity funds.
Positions. We earn transfer agent recordkeeping fees for administrative functions we perform on behalf of several of our mutual fund providers. An individual client account may include multiple fund positions for which we earn transfer agent recordkeeping fees. We may also receive fees earned for non-bank custodial services that we provide to clients with retirement plan accounts.
Sales mix. While our investment and savings products all provide similar long-term economic returns to the Company, our results in a given fiscal period will be affected by changes in the overall mix of products within these categories. Examples of changes in the sales mix that influence our results include the following:
•
sales of annuity products in the United States will generate higher revenues in the period such sales occur than sales of other investment products that either generate lower upfront revenues or, in the case of managed investments and segregated funds, no upfront revenues;
•
sales of a higher proportion of managed investments and segregated funds products will spread the revenues generated over time because we earn higher revenues based on assets under management for these accounts each period as opposed to earning upfront revenues based on product sales; and
•
sales of a higher proportion of mutual fund products sold will impact the timing and amount of revenue we earn given the distinct transfer agent recordkeeping and non-bank custodial services we provide for certain mutual fund products we distribute.
Corporate and Other Distributed Products Segment. We earn revenues and pay commissions and referral fees within our Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment for mortgage loan originations, prepaid legal services, auto and homeowners’ insurance referrals, and other financial products, all of which are originated by third parties. Our Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment also includes in-force policies from several discontinued lines of insurance underwritten by National Benefit Life Insurance Company (“NBLIC”).
Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment net investment income reflects actual net investment income recognized by the Company less the amount allocated to our Term Life Insurance segment based on the assumed net interest accreted to the segment’s U.S. GAAP-measured future policy benefit reserve liability less DAC. Actual net investment income reflected in the Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment is impacted by the size and performance of our invested asset portfolio, which can be influenced by interest rates, credit spreads, and the mix of invested assets.
The Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment also includes corporate income and expenses not allocated to our other segments, general and administrative expenses (other than expenses that are allocated to our Term Life Insurance or Investment and Savings Products segments), interest expense on notes payable, redundant reserve financing transactions and our revolving credit facility, as well as realized gains and losses on our invested asset portfolio.
Capital Structure. Our financial results are affected by our capital structure, which includes our senior unsecured notes (the “Senior Notes”), redundant reserve financing transactions, our revolving credit facility, and our common stock. See Note 10 (Debt), Note 12 (Stockholders’ Equity) and Note 16 (Commitments and Contingent Liabilities) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information on changes in our capital structure.
Foreign Currency. The Canadian dollar is the functional currency for our Canadian subsidiaries and our consolidated financial results, reported in U.S. dollars, are affected by changes in the currency exchange rate. As such, the translated amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities attributable to our Canadian subsidiaries will be higher or lower in periods where the Canadian dollar appreciates or weakens relative to the U.S. dollar, respectively.
The year-end exchange rates (USD per CAD) used by the Company to translate our Canadian dollar functional currency assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars increased by 2% in 2020 from 2019. The average exchange rates used by the Company in 2020 to translate our Canadian dollar functional currency revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars decreased 1% compared to 2019.
See “Results of Operations” and “Financial Condition” and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Canadian Currency Risk” and Note 3 (Segment and Geographical Information) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information on our Canadian subsidiaries and the impact of foreign currency on our financial results.
Income Taxes. The profitability of the Company and its subsidiaries is affected by income taxes assessed by federal, state, and U.S. territorial jurisdictions in the U.S. and federal and provincial jurisdictions in Canada. Changes in tax legislation may impact the measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and the amount of income tax expense we incur.
Critical Accounting Estimates
We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These principles are established primarily by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 (Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The most significant items on our consolidated balance sheets are based on fair value determinations, accounting estimates and actuarial determinations, which are susceptible to changes in future periods and could affect our results of operations and financial position.
The estimates that we deem to be most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial position are those related to DAC, future policy benefit reserves and corresponding amounts recoverable from reinsurers, income taxes, and the valuation of investments. The preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from management’s analyses and judgments. Subsequent experience or use of other assumptions could produce significantly different results.
Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs. We defer incremental direct costs of successful contract acquisitions that result directly from and are essential to the contract transaction(s) and that would not have been incurred had the contract transaction(s) not occurred. These costs include commissions and policy issue expenses. Deferrable term life insurance policy acquisition costs are amortized over the initial level premium-paying period of the related policies in proportion to premium income and include assumptions made by us regarding persistency, expenses, interest rates and claims, which are updated on new business to reflect recent experience. These assumptions may not be modified, or unlocked on in-force term life insurance business, unless recoverability testing deems estimated future cash flows to be inadequate. DAC is subject to recoverability testing annually and when circumstances indicate that recoverability is uncertain.
In particular, the balance of DAC in our Term Life Insurance segment is susceptible to differences between estimated persistency assumptions and actual persistency experienced. If actual lapses are different from pricing assumptions for a particular period, the amount of DAC amortized for that period will be affected. For example, if actual annual lapses at each policy duration are 10% higher, we would recognize approximately $26 million of additional amortization of DAC expense as of December 31, 2020. Conversely, if actual annual lapses are 10% lower than anticipated, we would recognize approximately $26 million of lower amortization of DAC expense as of December 31, 2020 We believe that a plus or minus 10% annual lapse rate is a reasonably possible variation. In 2020, we experienced extraordinarily lower lapse rates as a result of policyholder sentiment associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the lower lapse rates, which were approximately 20% lower than 2019 (varying by duration), resulted in approximately $53 million of lower DAC amortization expense year-over-year. Differences between actual and expected persistency also impact the balance of future policy benefit reserves and reinsurance recoverables as discussed below. For additional information on DAC, see Note 1 (Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 7 (Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Future Policy Benefit Reserves and Reinsurance. Liabilities for future policy benefits on our term life insurance products are reserves established for death claims and waiver of premium benefits and have been computed using a net level method and include assumptions as to mortality, persistency, interest rates, disability rates, and other assumptions based on our historical experience, modified as necessary for new business to reflect anticipated trends and to include provisions for possible adverse deviation. Reserves related to reinsured policies are accounted for using assumptions consistent with those used to determine the future policy benefit reserves and are included in reinsurance recoverables in our consolidated balance sheets. Similar to the term life insurance DAC discussion above, we do not modify the assumptions used to establish future policy benefit reserves during the policy term unless recoverability testing deems them to be inadequate and there is no remaining DAC associated with the underlying policies. Our results depend significantly upon the extent to which our actual experience is consistent with the assumptions we used in determining our future policy benefit reserves. Our future policy benefit reserve assumptions and estimates require significant judgment and, therefore, are inherently uncertain. We cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts that we will pay for actual claims or the timing of those payments.
The net impact of differences between actual and expected persistency on future policy benefit reserves and reinsurance recoverables will partially offset the earnings impact recognized from DAC amortization noted above. In our Term Life Insurance segment, if actual annual lapses at each policy duration are 10% higher, the additional future policy benefit reserves that would be released is approximately $26 million, partially offset by the release of the corresponding recoverable from reinsurers asset of approximately $10 million using balances as of December 31, 2020. Conversely, the impact of a 10% decrease to lapse rates would increase future policy reserves approximately $26 million, partially offset by the recognition of approximately $10 million of reinsurance recoverables. Higher lapses in later policy durations would have a greater effect on the release of future policy benefit reserves since the future policy benefit reserves are higher at the later durations. Actual lapses in 2020 were approximately 20% lower than 2019, and as opposed to the example provided, the reductions were somewhat weighted to early durations. The earnings impact was approximately $26 million of higher benefits and claims expense net of reinsurance recoverables year-over-year.
For additional information on future policy benefits and reinsurance, see Note 1 (Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 6 (Reinsurance) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to (i) temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and (ii) operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not applicable to the periods in which we expect the temporary difference will reverse. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
In light of the multiple tax jurisdictions in which we operate, our tax returns are subject to routine audit by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxation authorities. These audits at times may produce alternative views regarding particular tax positions taken in the year(s) of review. As a result, the Company records uncertain tax positions, which require recognition at the time when it is deemed more likely than not that the position in question will be upheld. Although management believes that the judgment and estimates involved are reasonable and that the necessary provisions have been recorded, changes in circumstances or unexpected events could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
For additional information on income taxes, see Note 1 (Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 11 (Income Taxes) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Invested Assets. We hold primarily fixed-maturity securities, including bonds and redeemable preferred stocks. We have classified these invested assets as available-for-sale, except for the securities of our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary, which we have classified as trading securities. We also hold a credit-enhanced note, which we classified as a held-to-maturity security that was issued in exchange for a surplus note (the “Surplus Note”) with an equal principal amount as part of a redundant reserve financing transaction. All of these securities are carried at fair value, except for the held-to-maturity security, which is carried at amortized cost. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included as a separate component of other comprehensive income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
We also hold equity securities, including common and non-redeemable preferred stock. These equity securities are measured at fair value and changes in unrealized gains and losses are recognized in net income. Changes in fair value of trading securities are included in net income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income in the period in which the change occurred.
Fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information. We classify and disclose all invested assets carried at fair value in one of the three fair value measurement categories prescribed by U.S. GAAP.
As of each reporting period, we classify all invested assets in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Significant levels of estimation and judgment are required to determine the fair value of certain of our investments. The factors influencing these estimations and judgments are subject to change in subsequent reporting periods.
Credit Losses for Available-for-sale Fixed-maturity Securities. For available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position that we intend to sell or would more-likely-than-not be required to sell before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis, we recognize the impairment as a credit loss in our consolidated statements of income by writing down the amortized cost basis to the fair value. For available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position that we do not intend to sell or it is not more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis, we recognize the portion of the impairment that is due to a credit loss in our consolidated statements of income through an allowance. We reverse credit losses previously recognized in the allowance in situations where the estimate of credit losses on those securities has declined. We do not consider the length of time an available-for-sale security has been in an unrealized loss position when estimating credit losses.
Analyses that we perform to determine whether an impairment is due to a credit loss or other factors involve the use of estimates, assumptions, and subjectivity. We evaluate a number of quantitative and qualitative factors when determining the credit loss on individual securities, including issuer-specific risks as well as relevant macroeconomic risks. If these factors or future events change, we could experience material credit losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income for available-for-sale securities in
future periods, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and the size and quality of our invested assets portfolio.
For additional information on our invested assets, see Note 1 (Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 4 (Investments) and Note 5 (Fair Value of Financial Instruments) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Results of Operations
Revenues. Our revenues consist of the following:
•
Net premiums. Reflects direct premiums payable by our policyholders on our in-force insurance policies, primarily term life insurance, net of reinsurance premiums that we pay to reinsurers.
•
Commissions and fees. Consists primarily of dealer re-allowances earned on the sales of investment and savings products, trail commissions and management fees based on the asset values of client accounts, marketing and distribution fees from product originators, fees for non-bank custodial services rendered in our capacity as nominee on client retirement accounts funded by mutual funds on our servicing platform, transfer agent recordkeeping fees for mutual funds on our servicing platform, and fees associated with the sale of other distributed products.
•
Net investment income. Represents income, net of investment-related expenses, generated by our invested asset portfolio, which consists primarily of interest income earned on fixed-maturity investments. Investment income recorded on our held-to-maturity invested asset and the offsetting interest expense recorded for our Surplus Note are included in net investment income.
•
Realized investment gains (losses). Primarily reflects the difference between amortized cost and amounts realized on the sale of available-for-sale securities, credit losses recognized on available-for-sale securities, and changes in the fair value of equity securities.
•
Other, net. Reflects revenues generated primarily from the fees charged for access to Primerica Online (“POL”), our primary sales force support tool, as well as revenues from the sale of other miscellaneous items.
Benefits and Expenses. Our operating expenses consist of the following:
•
Benefits and claims. Reflects the benefits and claims payable on insurance policies, as well as changes in our reserves for future policy claims and reserves for other benefits payable, net of reinsurance.
•
Amortization of DAC. Represents the amortization of capitalized costs directly associated with the sale of an insurance policy or segregated fund, including sales commissions, medical examination and other underwriting costs, and other eligible policy issuance costs.
•
Sales commissions. Represents commissions to the sales representatives in connection with the sale of investment and savings products, and products other than insurance products.
•
Insurance expenses. Reflects non-capitalized insurance expenses, including staff compensation, technology and communications, insurance sales force-related costs, printing, postage and distribution of insurance sales materials, outsourcing and professional fees, premium taxes, and other corporate and administrative fees and expenses related to our insurance operations. Insurance expenses also include both indirect policy issuance costs and costs associated with unsuccessful efforts to acquire new policies.
•
Insurance commissions. Reflects sales commissions with respect to insurance products that are not eligible for deferral.
•
Interest expense. Reflects interest on our notes payable, any interest and the commitment fee on our revolving credit facility, the financing charges related to the letter of credit issued under the credit facility agreement with Deutsche Bank, fees paid for the credit enhancement feature on our held-to-maturity invested asset, and a finance charge incurred pursuant to one of our coinsurance agreements with an IPO coinsurer.
•
Other operating expenses. Consists primarily of expenses that are unrelated to the distribution of insurance products, including staff compensation, technology and communications, various sales force-related costs, non-bank custodial and transfer agent recordkeeping administrative costs, outsourcing and professional fees, and other corporate and administrative fees and expenses.
Insurance expenses and other operating expenses directly attributable to the Term Life Insurance and the Investment and Savings Products segments are recorded directly to the applicable segment. We allocate certain other revenue and operating expenses that are not directly attributable to a specific operating segment using methods expected to reasonably measure the benefit received by each reporting segment. Such methods include time studies, recorded usage, revenue distribution, and sales force representative distribution. These allocated items include fees charged for access to POL and costs incurred for technology, sales force support, occupancy and other general and administrative costs. Costs that are not directly charged or allocated to our two primary operating segments are included in our Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment.
Primerica, Inc. and Subsidiaries Results. Our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were as follows:

Refer to the 2019 MD&A for discussions of 2018 items and comparisons between 2019 and 2018 financial results.

Less than 1% or not meaningful
Total revenues. Total revenues increased in 2020 from 2019 driven by the impact of strong sales and significant positive trends in persistency in recent periods on direct premiums for term life insurance policies that are not subject to the IPO coinsurance transactions. Commissions and fees from our Investment and Savings Products segment increased largely due to growth in average client asset values.
Net investment income decreased in 2020 from 2019 largely due to the negative impact from a lower total return on the deposit asset backing the 10% coinsurance agreement that is subject to deposit method accounting. The lower year-over-year total return of $9.2 million on this deposit asset was primarily due to a negative mark-to-market adjustment as the prices of fixed income securities held within the deposit asset fell during 2020 compared to an increase in 2019. Also contributing to a decrease in net investment income were lower yields on our invested asset portfolio of approximately $9.0 million. The decrease in net investment income was partially offset by the larger size of the invested asset portfolio, which resulted in an increase in net investment income of approximately $7.5 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Investment income net of investment expenses includes interest earned on our held-to-maturity invested asset, which is completely offset by interest expense on the Surplus Note, thereby eliminating any impact on net investment income. Amounts recognized for each line item will remain offsetting and will fluctuate from period to period along with the principal amounts of the held-to-maturity asset and the Surplus Note based on the balance of reserves being contractually supported under a redundant reserve financing transaction used by Vidalia Re, Inc. (“Vidalia Re”), a special purpose financial captive insurance company and wholly owned subsidiary of Primerica Life Insurance Company (“Primerica Life”). For more information on the Surplus Note, see Note 10 (Debt) and for additional information on the redundant reserve financing transaction used by Vidalia Re, see Note 4 (Investments) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Realized investment gains (losses) was a loss in 2020 compared to a gain in 2019. This was primarily due to a $2.5 million negative mark-to-market adjustment on equity securities held within our invested asset portfolio that were in industries adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and which had not fully recovered as of year-end. Also contributing to the realized investment loss in 2020 is the recognition of $3.8 million credit losses for specific issuers that operate in distressed industry sectors that were particularly affected by deteriorating economic conditions during 2020.
Other net revenues increased in 2020 from 2019 largely due to a $9.5 million increase in fees received for access to POL, our primary sales force support tool. The increase in these fees is consistent with subscriber growth, as the size of the independent sales force and number of new recruits continued to increase. Fees collected for POL subscriptions are allocated between our Term Life Insurance segment and our Investment and Savings Products segment based on the estimated number of sales representatives that are licensed to sell products in each respective segment. The increase in these fees was accompanied by higher spending reflected in insurance and
other operating expenses to support and enhance POL. These increases were partially offset by a waiver of approximately $3.0 million of certain policy administrative fees paid by our representatives as we provided relief in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Total benefits and expenses. Total benefits and expenses increased significantly in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to the growth in benefits and claims as a result of higher mortality experience caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and growth in our in-force book of business due to positive persistency trends experienced in 2020. Positive persistency also led to a decrease in the amortization of DAC, which partially offset the increases in benefits and claims. Also contributing to the increase in benefits and expenses in 2020 are higher insurance and other operating expenses to support growth in the business, enhanced technology-related capabilities, as well as increased employee-related expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in insurance and other operating expenses as a result of business travel restrictions and event cancellations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Income taxes. Our effective income tax rate for 2020 was 23.8%, relatively consistent with 23.2% in 2019.
For additional information, see the discussions of results of operations by segment below.
Term Life Insurance Segment. Our results for the Term Life Insurance segment for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were as follows:
(1)
Refer to the 2019 MD&A for discussions of 2018 items and comparisons between 2019 and 2018 financial results.
Net premiums. Direct premiums increased in 2020 from 2019 due to high levels of persistency experienced during the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of favorable public sentiment for protection products in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Also contributing to the increase in direct premiums were strong sales of new policies throughout 2020 that contributed to growth in the in-force book of business. Ceded premiums included $62.2 million in higher non-level YRT reinsurance ceded premiums as business not subject to the IPO coinsurance transactions ages, reduced by $50.6 million in lower coinsurance ceded premiums due to the run-off of business subject to the IPO coinsurance transactions.
Allocated net investment income. Allocated net investment income increased in 2020 from 2019 due to an increase in the assumed net interest accreted to our Term Life Insurance segment’s future policy benefit reserve liability less deferred acquisition costs as our Term Life Insurance segment’s in-force business continues to grow.
Benefits and claims. Benefits and claims increased in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to higher mortality experience as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as larger benefit reserve increases due to favorable persistency trends. Total claims increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 by $33.0 million over historical trends, which was primarily driven by COVID-19 related claims. Benefit reserve increases due to higher persistency were approximately $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, benefit reserves increased by $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to lower interest rates applied to 2020 business.
Amortization of DAC. The amortization of DAC decreased in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to high levels of persistency experienced throughout all policy durations as a result of favorable public sentiment for protection products in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This reduced the amortization of DAC by approximately $53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Insurance expenses. Insurance expenses increased in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to increases in expenses of approximately $17.2 million to support growth in the business, enhance technology-related capabilities, as well as higher employee-related expenses, partially offset by a decrease in expenses of approximately $6.0 million as a result of business travel restrictions, event cancellations and reduction in other business activities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Insurance commissions. Insurance commissions increased in 2020 from 2019 as a result of higher non-deferrable sales force promotional activities. Cost savings from COVID-19 pandemic insurance expenses decreases discussed above were used in part to fund these sales force promotional activities.
Investment and Savings Products Segment. Our results of operations for the Investment and Savings Products segment for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were as follows:
(1)
Refer to the 2019 MD&A for discussions of 2018 items and comparisons between 2019 and 2018 financial results.
Commissions and fees. Commissions and fees increased in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to the growth in asset-based revenues as average client asset values increased due to market appreciation, continued higher inflows, and lower redemption activity during the year. Account-based revenues also increased in 2020 due to the cumulative effect of retail mutual fund sales in recent periods that led to an increase in the number of retail mutual fund positions serviced on our transfer agent recordkeeping platform. Contributing modestly to the increase in commissions and fees were higher sales-based revenues, which increased due to growth in mutual fund sales but were offset by declining annuity sales.
Amortization of DAC. Amortization of DAC increased in 2020 from 2019 largely due to weaker market performance of the funds underlying our Canadian segregated funds product caused by market volatility and economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in first quarter of 2020 compared with stronger market performance throughout 2019. Both periods reflect lower amortization of DAC as a result of favorable redemption experience.
Sales commissions. The increase in sales-based and asset-based commissions in 2020 from 2019 was generally consistent with the increase in sales-based revenues. When considering that asset-based expenses for our Canadian segregated funds were reflected within insurance commissions and amortization of DAC, the increase in asset-based commissions in 2020 from 2019 was consistent with the increase in asset-based revenues excluding the Canadian segregated funds.
Other operating expenses. Other operating expenses decreased in 2020 from 2019 due to the phase-in of reduced fees paid to a service provider for the Company’s transfer agent recordkeeping platform and business travel restrictions and event cancellations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by increases in expenses due to growth in the business and higher employee-related expenses.
Corporate and Other Distributed Products Segment. Our results of operations for the Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were as follows:
(1)
Refer the 2019 MD&A for discussions of 2018 items and comparisons between 2019 and 2018 financial results.
*
Less than 1% or not meaningful
Total revenues. Total revenues decreased in 2020 from 2019 largely due to the decrease in net investment income and realized gains (losses) as discussed in the Primerica, Inc. and Subsidiaries Results of Operations section above combined with an increase in the allocation of net investment income accreted to our Term life Insurance segment as our in-force business continued to grow. Partially offsetting this decrease was commission revenues from the expansion of our U.S. mortgage distribution business. Closed mortgage loan volume of approximately $442.5 million generated mortgage commission revenues of approximately $8.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to closed mortgage loan volume of $31.1 million and mortgage commission revenues of approximately $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Total Benefits and Expenses. Total benefits and expenses increased in 2020 from 2019 as a result of higher operating expenses primarily due to employee and technology-related expenses and higher sales commissions driven by increased sales in our mortgage distribution business. Also contributing to the increase were elevated claims in closed blocks of life insurance business and $0.9 million of higher losses for write-offs of reinsurance recoverables on closed blocks of business.
Financial Condition
Investments. Our insurance business is primarily focused on selling term life insurance, which does not include an investment component for the policyholder. The invested asset portfolio funded by premiums from our term life insurance business does not involve the substantial asset accumulations and spread requirements that exist with other non-term life insurance products. As a result, the profitability of our term life insurance business is not as sensitive to the impact that interest rates have on our invested asset portfolio and investment income as the profitability of other companies that distribute non-term life insurance products.
We follow a conservative investment strategy designed to emphasize the preservation of our invested assets and provide adequate liquidity for the prompt payment of claims. To meet business needs and mitigate risks, our investment guidelines provide restrictions on our portfolio’s composition, including limits on asset type, per issuer limits, credit quality limits, portfolio duration, limits on the amount of investments in approved countries and permissible security types. We also manage and monitor our allocation of investments to limit the accumulation of any disproportionate concentrations of risk among industry sectors or issuer countries outside of the U.S. and Canada. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we did not hold any country of issuer concentrations outside of the U.S. or Canada that represented more than 5% of the fair value of our available-for-sale invested asset portfolio or any industry concentrations of corporate bonds that represented more than 10% of the fair value of our available-for-sale invested asset portfolio.
We invest a portion of our portfolio in assets denominated in Canadian dollars to support our Canadian operations. Additionally, to ensure adequate liquidity for payment of claims, we take into account the maturity and duration of our invested asset portfolio and our general liability profile.
We also hold within our invested asset portfolio a credit enhanced note (“LLC Note”) issued by a limited liability company owned by a third-party service provider which is classified as a held-to-maturity security. The LLC Note, which is scheduled to mature on December 31, 2030, was obtained in exchange for the Surplus Note of equal principal amount issued by Vidalia Re. For more information on the LLC Note, see Note 4 (Investments) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
We have an investment committee composed of members of our senior management team that is responsible for establishing and maintaining our investment guidelines and supervising our investment activity. Our investment committee regularly monitors our overall investment results and our compliance with our investment objectives and guidelines. We use a third-party investment advisor to assist us in the management of our investing activities. Our investment advisor reports to our investment committee.
Our invested asset portfolio is subject to a variety of risks, including risks related to general economic conditions, market volatility, interest rate fluctuations, liquidity risk and credit and default risk. Investment guideline restrictions have been established to minimize the effect of these risks but may not always be effective due to factors beyond our control. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. A significant increase in interest rates could result in significant losses, realized or unrealized, in the value of our invested asset portfolio. For example, from December 31, 2019 to March 31, 2020, market volatility and economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic caused a sharp increase in credit spreads, which translated to a reduction in the net unrealized gain on our available-for-sale securities portfolio from $82.2 million to a net unrealized loss of $1.3 million. From March 31, 2020 to December 31, 2020, credit spreads tightened sharply and bond markets recovered, resulting in growth of the net unrealized gain on our available-for-sale securities portfolio to $163.3 million. Additionally, with respect to some of our investments, we are subject to prepayment and, therefore, reinvestment risk.
Details on asset mix (excluding our held-to-maturity security) were as follows:
*
Less than 1%.
The composition and duration of our portfolio will vary depending on several factors, including the yield curve and our opinion of the relative value among various asset classes. The year-end average rating, duration and book yield of our fixed-maturity portfolio (excluding our held-to-maturity security) were as follows:
Ratings for our investments in fixed-maturity securities are determined using Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations designations and/or equivalent ratings. The distribution of our investments in fixed-maturity securities (excluding our held-to-maturity security) by rating, including those classified as trading securities, were as follows:
(1)
Includes trading securities at carrying value and available-for-sale securities at amortized cost.

Includes trading securities at carrying value and available-for-sale securities at amortized cost.
For additional information on our invested asset portfolio, see Note 4 (Investments) and Note 5 (Fair Value of Financial Instruments) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Other Significant Assets and Liabilities. The balances of and changes in other significant assets and liabilities were as follows:
Reinsurance recoverables. Reinsurance recoverables reflects future policy benefit reserves and claim reserves ceded to reinsurers, including the IPO coinsurers. Reinsurance recoverables as of December 31, 2020 increased compared with December 31, 2019 primarily due to higher mortality experience as well as larger ceded reserves due to favorable persistency trends, both driven by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Deferred policy acquisition costs, net. The increase in DAC was primarily a result of the cumulative impact of incremental commissions and expenses deferred as a result of new business in 2020 not subject to the IPO coinsurance agreements and significant improvements in persistency as a result of favorable public sentiment for protection products in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Future policy benefits. The increase in future policy benefits was a result of the growth in our in-force book of business due to strong sales of new policies and persistency improvements.
For additional information, see the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Dividends and other payments to the Parent Company from its subsidiaries are our principal sources of cash. The amount of dividends paid by the subsidiaries is dependent on their capital needs to fund future growth and applicable regulatory restrictions. The primary uses of funds by the Parent Company include the payments of stockholder dividends, interest on notes payable, general operating expenses, and income taxes, as well as repurchases of shares of our common stock outstanding. During 2020, our life insurance underwriting companies declared and paid ordinary dividends of $192.5 million to the Parent Company. See Note 15 (Statutory Accounting and Dividend Restrictions) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information on insurance subsidiary dividends and statutory restrictions. In addition, in 2020 our non-life insurance subsidiaries declared and paid dividends of $185.5 million to the Parent Company. At December 31, 2020, the Parent Company had cash and invested assets of $350.2 million.
The Parent Company’s subsidiaries generate operating cash flows primarily from term life insurance premiums (net of premiums ceded to reinsurers), income from invested assets, commissions and fees collected from the distribution of investment and savings products as well as other financial products. The subsidiaries’ principal operating cash outflows include the payment of insurance claims and benefits (net of ceded claims recovered from reinsurers), commissions to the sales force, insurance and other operating expenses, interest expense for future policy benefit reserves financing transactions, and income taxes.
The distribution and underwriting of term life insurance requires upfront cash outlays at the time the policy is issued as we pay a substantial majority of the sales commission during the first year following the sale of a policy and incur costs for underwriting activities at the inception of a policy’s term. During the early years of a policy’s term, we generally receive level term premiums in excess of claims paid. We invest the excess cash generated during earlier policy years in fixed-maturity and equity securities held in support of future policy benefit reserves. In later policy years, cash received from the maturity or sale of invested assets is used to pay claims in excess of level term premiums received.
Historically, cash flows generated by our businesses, primarily from our existing block of term life policies and our investment and savings products, have provided us with sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We have maintained strong cash flows despite the COVID-19 pandemic due to strong persistency and our use of reinsurance. Although our future cash flow could be adversely affected by further deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we anticipate that cash flows from our businesses will continue to provide sufficient operating liquidity over the next 12 months.
If necessary, we could seek to enhance our liquidity position or capital structure through sales of our available-for-sale investment portfolio, changes in the timing or amount of share repurchases, borrowings against our revolving credit facility, or some combination of these sources. Additionally, we believe that cash flows from our businesses and potential sources of funding will sufficiently support our long-term liquidity needs.
Cash Flows. The components of the changes in cash and cash equivalents were as follows:
(1)
Refer to the 2019 MD&A for discussions of 2018 items and comparisons between 2019 and 2018 financial results.
Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2020 from 2019 largely due to growth in direct premiums from higher sales of new policies and positive persistency trends in recent periods. The impact of direct premium growth and the additional layering of net premiums from term life insurance policies not subject to the IPO coinsurance transactions has continued to drive positive incremental cash flows. Higher benefits and claims recognized during 2020 did not significantly impact cash flows due to an increase in claims payable at December 31, 2020 and a corresponding increase in ceded claims owed from reinsurers. Also contributing to the increase in cash from operating activities was the timing of investments in trading securities at our broker-dealer subsidiary. Partially offsetting the increase in cash from operating activities in 2020 versus 2019 were higher cash expenditures for policy acquisition costs due to the growth in new policy sales.
Investing Activities. Cash flows used in investing activities decreased in 2020 from 2019 as a result of lower purchases of investment securities due to limited reinvestment opportunities and higher sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities in our invested asset portfolio.
Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities increased in 2020 from 2019 as expected due to higher dividends paid to stockholders as the Company increased its per share dividend in 2020. Also contributing to the increase in cash used in financing activities were higher share repurchases in 2020.
Risk-Based Capital (“RBC”). The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has established RBC standards for U.S. life insurers, as well as a risk-based capital model act (the “RBC Model Act”) that has been adopted by the insurance regulatory authorities. The RBC Model Act requires that life insurers annually submit a report to state regulators regarding their RBC based upon four categories of risk: asset risk; insurance risk; interest rate risk and business risk. The capital requirement for each is determined by applying factors that vary based upon the degree of risk to various asset, premiums and policy benefit reserve items. The formula is an early warning tool to identify possible weakly capitalized companies for purposes of initiating further regulatory action.
As of December 31, 2020, our U.S. life insurance subsidiaries maintained statutory capital and surplus substantially in excess of the applicable regulatory requirements and remain well positioned to support existing operations and fund future growth.
In Canada, an insurer’s minimum capital requirement is overseen by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (“OSFI”) and determined as the sum of the capital requirements for five categories of risk: asset default risk; mortality/morbidity/lapse
risks; changes in interest rate environment risk; segregated funds risk; and foreign exchange risk. As of December 31, 2020, Primerica Life Insurance Company of Canada was in compliance with Canada’s minimum capital requirements as determined by OSFI.
For more information regarding statutory capital requirements and dividend capacities of our insurance subsidiaries, see Note 15 (Statutory Accounting and Dividend Restrictions) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information.
Redundant Reserve Financings. The Model Regulation entitled Valuation of Life Insurance Policies, commonly known as Regulation XXX, requires insurers to carry statutory policy benefit reserves for term life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees which are often significantly in excess of the future policy benefit reserves that insurers deem necessary to satisfy claim obligations (“redundant policy benefit reserves”). Accordingly, many insurance companies have sought ways to reduce their capital needs by financing redundant policy benefit reserves through bank financing, reinsurance arrangements and other financing transactions.
We have established Peach Re, Inc. ("Peach Re") and Vidalia Re as special purpose financial captive insurance companies and wholly owned subsidiaries of Primerica Life. Primerica Life has ceded certain term life policies issued prior to 2011 to Peach Re as part of a Regulation XXX redundant reserve financing transaction (the “Peach Re Redundant Reserve Financing Transaction”) and has ceded certain term life policies issued in 2011 through 2017 to Vidalia Re as part of a Regulation XXX redundant reserve financing transaction (the “Vidalia Re Redundant Reserve Financing Transaction”). These redundant reserve financing transactions allow us to more efficiently manage and deploy our capital.
The NAIC has adopted a model regulation for determining reserves using a principle-based approach (“principle-based reserves” or “PBR”), which is designed to reflect each insurer’s own experience in calculating reserves and move away from a single prescriptive reserving formula. Primerica Life adopted PBR as of January 1, 2018. PBR significantly reduced the redundant statutory policy benefit reserve requirements while still ensuring adequate liabilities are held. The regulation only applies for business issued after the effective date. See Note 4 (Investments), Note 10 (Debt) and Note 16 (Commitments and Contingent Liabilities) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information on these redundant reserve financing transactions.
Notes Payable. The Company has $375.0 million of publicly-traded, Senior Notes outstanding issued at a price of 99.843% with an annual interest rate of 4.75%, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15. The Senior Notes mature July 15, 2022. We were in compliance with the covenants of the Senior Notes at December 31, 2020. No events of default occurred on the Senior Notes during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Financial Ratings. As of December 31, 2020, the investment grade credit ratings for our Senior Notes were as follows:
As of December 31, 2020, Primerica Life’s financial strength ratings were as follows:
Securities Lending. We participate in securities lending transactions with brokers to increase investment income with minimal risk. See Note 4 (Investments) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.
Short-Term Borrowings. We had no short-term borrowings as of or during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Surplus Note. Vidalia Re issued a Surplus Note in exchange for the LLC Note as a part of the Vidalia Re Redundant Reserve Financing Transaction. The Surplus Note has a principal amount equal to the LLC Note and is scheduled to mature on December 31, 2030. For more information on the Surplus Note, see Note 10 (Debt) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We have no transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements to which an entity unconsolidated with the Company is a party, under which the Company maintains any off-balance sheet obligations or guarantees as of December 31, 2020.
Credit Facility Agreement. We maintain an unsecured $200.0 million revolving credit facility ("Revolving Credit Facility") with a syndicate of commercial banks that has a scheduled termination date of December 19, 2022. Amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a periodic rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or the base rate, plus in either case an applicable margin. The Revolving Credit Facility contains language that allows for the Company and the lenders to agree on a comparable or successor reference rate in the event LIBOR is no longer available. The Revolving Credit Facility also permits the issuance of letters of credit. The applicable margins are based on our debt rating with such margins for LIBOR rate loans and letters of credit ranging from 1.125% to 1.625% per annum and for base rate loans ranging from 0.125% to 0.625% per annum.
Under the Revolving Credit Facility, we incur a commitment fee that is payable quarterly in arrears and is determined by our debt rating. This commitment fee ranges from 0.125% to 0.225% per annum of the aggregate $200.0 million commitment of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, no amounts have been drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility and we were in compliance with its covenants. Furthermore, no events of default have occurred under the Revolving Credit Facility in 2020.
Contractual Obligations. Our contractual obligations, including payments due by period, were as follows:
Our liability for future policy benefits represents the present value of estimated future policy benefits to be paid, less the present value of estimated future net benefit premiums to be collected. Net benefit premiums represent the portion of gross premiums required to provide for all benefits and associated expenses. These benefit payments are contingent on policyholders continuing to renew their policies and make their premium payments. Our contractual obligations table discloses the impact of benefit payments that will be due assuming the underlying policy renewals and premium payments continue as expected in our actuarial models. The future policy benefit payments represented in the table are presented on an undiscounted basis, gross of any amounts recoverable through reinsurance agreements and gross of any premiums to be collected. We expect to fully fund the obligations for future policy benefits from cash flows from general account invested assets, claims reimbursed by reinsurers, and from future premiums. These estimations are based on mortality and lapse assumptions comparable with our historical experience. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the amounts presented could materially differ from actual results.
Policy claims and other benefits payable represents claims and benefits that have been incurred but not paid to policyholders.
Other policyholders’ funds primarily represent claim payments left on deposit with us.
Long-term debt principal relates to our Senior Notes.
Interest obligations (reported within other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets) reflect expected interest on our Senior Notes, the commitment fee on our Revolving Credit Facility, the financing charges related to an issued letter of credit, fees paid for the credit enhancement feature on the LLC Note, and a finance charge incurred pursuant to one of our IPO coinsurance agreements as of December 31, 2020. We did not include the principal or interest on the Surplus Note in the table above as the payments due for these items are contractually offset by the principal and interest on the LLC Note as long as we hold the LLC Note. The Company asserts its positive intent and ability to hold the LLC Note until maturity.
Commissions represent commissions that have been earned by the sales force but have not been paid as of December 31, 2020. We are only obligated to pay commissions as earned from sales of our products. The total liability amount is reported within other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.
Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. These obligations consist primarily of accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities, including committed funds related to meetings and conventions for the sales force, plus a variety of vendor commitments funding our ongoing business operations. The total liability amount is reported within other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.
Our lease obligations primarily represent payments for leases related to office space. For additional information on leases see Note 19 (Leases) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Income tax payable represents income taxes owed at year-end.
Other liabilities are obligations reported within the consolidated balance sheets and consist primarily of amounts due under reinsurance agreements and general accruals and payables. The total payments within the table differ from the amounts presented in our consolidated balance sheets due to the exclusion of amounts where a reasonable estimate of the period of settlement cannot be determined.
For additional information concerning our commitments and contingencies, see Note 16 (Commitments and Contingent Liabilities) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
