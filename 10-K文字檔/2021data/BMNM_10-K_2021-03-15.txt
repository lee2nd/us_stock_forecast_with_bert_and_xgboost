ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are those that are not historical in nature. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements.
Overview
Bimini Capital Management, Inc. ("Bimini Capital" or the "Company") is a holding company that was formed in September 2003. The Company’s principal wholly-owned operating subsidiary is Royal Palm Capital, LLC. We operate in two business segments: the asset management segment, which includes (a) the investment advisory services provided by Royal Palm’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Bimini Advisors Holdings, LLC, to Orchid, and (b) the investment portfolio segment, which includes the investment activities conducted by Royal Palm.
Bimini Advisors Holdings, LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bimini Advisors, LLC (an investment advisor registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission), are collectively referred to as “Bimini Advisors.” Bimini Advisors serves as the external manager of the portfolio of Orchid Island Capital, Inc. ("Orchid"). From this arrangement, the Company receives management fees and expense reimbursements. As manager, Bimini Advisors is responsible for administering Orchid's business activities and day-to-day operations. Pursuant to the terms of the management agreement, Bimini Advisors provides Orchid with its management team, including its officers, along with appropriate support personnel. Bimini Advisors is at all times subject to the supervision and oversight of Orchid's board of directors and has only such functions and authority as delegated to it.
Royal Palm Capital, LLC (collectively with its wholly-owned subsidiaries referred to as “Royal Palm”) maintains an investment portfolio, consisting primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") issued and guaranteed by a federally chartered corporation or agency ("Agency MBS"). Our investment strategy focuses on, and our portfolio consists of, two categories of Agency MBS: (i) traditional pass-through Agency MBS, such as mortgage pass-through certificates issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae (the “GSEs”) and collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) issued by the GSEs (“PT MBS”) and (ii) structured Agency MBS, such as interest only securities ("IOs"), inverse interest only securities ("IIOs") and principal only securities ("POs"), among other types of structured Agency MBS. In addition, Royal Palm receives dividends from its investment in Orchid common shares.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
Beginning in mid-March 2020, the global pandemic associated with the novel coronavirus COVID-19 (“COVID-19”) and related economic conditions began to impact our financial position and results of operations. As a result of the economic, health and market turmoil brought about by COVID-19, the Agency MBS market experienced severe dislocations. This resulted in falling prices of our assets and increased margin calls from our repurchase agreement lenders. Further, as interest rates declined, we faced additional margin calls related to our various hedge positions. In order to maintain our leverage ratio at prudent levels, maintain sufficient cash and liquidity, reduce risk and satisfy margin calls, we sold assets at levels significantly below their carrying values and closed several of our hedge positions. During this period, we sold approximately $171.2 million of MBS during the three months ended March 31, 2020, realizing losses of approximately $5.8 million.
The Agency MBS market largely stabilized after the Federal Reserve (the “Fed”) announced on March 23, 2020 that it would purchase Agency MBS and U.S. Treasuries in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning. Agency MBS valuations have increased substantially since the end of March 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had timely satisfied all margin calls.
In response to the Shelter in Place order issued in Florida in March 2020, management has invoked the Company’s Disaster Recovery Plan and its employees are working remotely. Prior planning resulted in the successful implementation of this plan and key operational team members maintain daily communication.
In addition, President Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which will provide billions of dollars of relief to individuals, businesses, state and local governments, and the health care system suffering the impact of the pandemic, including mortgage loan forbearance and modification programs to qualifying borrowers who may have difficulty making their loan payments. On April 13, 2020, the Company received $152,000 through the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act in the form of a low interest loan. The Company has evaluated the other provisions of the CARES Act and does not believe it will have material effect on our consolidated financial statements. The Federal Housing Financing Agency (the “FHFA”) has instructed the GSEs on how they will handle servicer advances for loans that back Agency MBS that enter into forbearance, which should limit prepayments during the forbearance period that could have resulted otherwise. During the forbearance period the Company will continue to receive scheduled principal and interest each month on its Agency MBS securities. There can be no assurance as to how, in the long term, these and other actions by the U.S. government will affect the efficiency, liquidity and stability of the financial and mortgage markets. To the extent the financial or mortgage markets do not respond favorably to any of these actions, or such actions do not function as intended, our business, results of operations and financial condition may continue to be materially adversely affected.
Stock Repurchase Plan
On March 26, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a Stock Repurchase Plan (“Repurchase Plan”). Pursuant to the Repurchase Plan, we may purchase up to 500,000 shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock from time to time, subject to certain limitations imposed by Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Share repurchases may be executed through various means, including, without limitation, open market transactions. The Repurchase Plan does not obligate the Company to purchase any shares. The Repurchase Plan, as currently extended, expires on November 15, 2021. The authorization for the Share Repurchase Plan may be terminated, increased or decreased by the Company’s Board of Directors in its discretion at any time.
From commencement of the Repurchase Plan, through December 31, 2020, we repurchased a total of 70,404 shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $166,945, including commissions and fees, for a weighted average price of $2.37 per share.
Tender Offer
In July 2019, we completed a “modified Dutch auction” tender offer and paid an aggregate of $2.2 million, excluding fees and related expenses, to repurchase 1.1 million shares of our Class A common stock at a price of $2.00 per share.
Factors that Affect our Results of Operations and Financial Condition
A variety of industry and economic factors (in addition to those related to the COVID-19 pandemic) may impact our results of operations and financial condition. These factors include:
•
interest rate trends;
•
the difference between Agency MBS yields and our funding and hedging costs;
•
competition for, and supply of, investments in Agency MBS;
•
actions taken by the U.S. government, including the presidential administration, the Federal Reserve (the “Fed”), the Federal Open Market Committee (the “FOMC”), The Federal Housing Finance Agency (the “FHFA”) and the U.S. Treasury;
•
prepayment rates on mortgages underlying our Agency MBS, and credit trends insofar as they affect prepayment rates;
•
the equity markets and the ability of Orchid to raise additional capital; and
•
other market developments.
In addition, a variety of factors relating to our business may also impact our results of operations and financial condition. These factors include:
•
our degree of leverage;
•
our access to funding and borrowing capacity;
•
our borrowing costs;
•
our hedging activities;
•
the market value of our investments;
•
the requirements to qualify for a registration exemption under the Investment Company Act;
•
our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and net capital loss carryforwards to reduce our taxable income;
•
the impact of possible future changes in tax laws or tax rates; and
•
our ability to manage the portfolio of Orchid and maintain our role as manager.
Results of Operations
Described below are the Company’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Net (Loss) Income Summary
Consolidated net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $5.5 million, or $0.47 basic and diluted loss per share of Class A Common Stock, as compared to consolidated net income of $13.3 million, or $1.09 basic and diluted income per share of Class A Common Stock, for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The components of net (loss) income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, along with the changes in those components are presented in the table below:
GAAP and Non-GAAP Reconciliation
Economic Interest Expense and Economic Net Interest Income
We use derivative instruments, specifically Eurodollar and Treasury Note (“T-Note”) futures contracts and TBA short positions to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk on repurchase agreements in a rising rate environment.
We have not designated our derivative financial instruments as hedge accounting relationships, but rather hold them for economic hedging purposes. Changes in fair value of these instruments are presented in a separate line item in our consolidated statements of operations and not included in interest expense. As such, for financial reporting purposes, interest expense and cost of funds are not impacted by the fluctuation in value of the derivative instruments.
For the purpose of computing economic net interest income and ratios relating to cost of funds measures, GAAP interest expense has been adjusted to reflect the realized and unrealized gains or losses on certain derivative instruments the Company uses that pertain to each period presented. We believe that adjusting our interest expense for the periods presented by the gains or losses on these derivative instruments would not accurately reflect our economic interest expense for these periods. The reason is that these derivative instruments may cover periods that extend into the future, not just the current period. Any realized or unrealized gains or losses on the instruments reflect the change in market value of the instrument caused by changes in underlying interest rates applicable to the term covered by the instrument, not just the current period.
For each period presented, we have combined the effects of the derivative financial instruments in place for the respective period with the actual interest expense incurred on our borrowings to reflect total economic interest expense for the applicable period. Interest expense, including the effect of derivative instruments for the period, is referred to as economic interest expense. Net interest income, when calculated to include the effect of derivative instruments for the period, is referred to as economic net interest income.
 
We believe that economic interest expense and economic net interest income provide meaningful information to consider, in addition to the respective amounts prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures help management to evaluate our financial position and performance without the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that are not necessarily indicative of our current investment portfolio or operations. The gains or losses on derivative instruments presented in our consolidated statements of operations are not necessarily representative of the total interest rate expense that we will ultimately realize. This is because as interest rates move up or down in the future, the gains or losses we ultimately realize, and which will affect our total interest rate expense in future periods, may differ from the unrealized gains or losses recognized as of the reporting date.
Our presentation of the economic value of our hedging strategy has important limitations. First, other market participants may calculate economic interest expense and economic net interest income differently than the way we calculate them. Second, while we believe that the calculation of the economic value of our hedging strategy described above helps to present our financial position and performance, it may be of limited usefulness as an analytical tool. Therefore, the economic value of our investment strategy should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for interest expense and net interest income computed in accordance with GAAP.
The tables below present a reconciliation of the adjustments to interest expense shown for each period relative to our derivative instruments, and the consolidated statements of operations line item, gains (losses) on derivative instruments, calculated in accordance with GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and for each quarter during 2020 and 2019. As a result of the market turmoil during the first quarter of 2020 several hedge positions where closed. However, the hedges closed were hedges that covered periods well beyond the first quarter of 2020. Accordingly, the open equity at the time these hedges were closed will result in adjustments to economic interest expense through the balance of their respective original hedge periods. Since the Company’s portfolio was significantly reduced during the first quarter of 2020, the effect of applying the open equity at the time of closure of these hedge instruments to the current, and much smaller, repurchase agreement interest expense amounts could materially impact the economic interest amounts reported below.

Segment Information
We have two operating segments. The asset management segment includes the investment advisory services provided by Bimini Advisors to Orchid and Royal Palm. The investment portfolio segment includes the investment activities conducted by Royal Palm. Segment information for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:
(1)
Includes advisory services revenue received by Bimini Advisors from Royal Palm.
(2)
Includes interest on long-term debt.
(3)
Includes gains (losses) on Eurodollar futures contracts entered into as a hedge on junior subordinated notes and fair value adjustments on retained interests in securitizations.
(4)
Corporate expenses are allocated based on each segment’s proportional share of total revenues.
Asset Management Segment
Advisory Services Revenue
Advisory services revenue consists of management fees and overhead reimbursements charged to Orchid for the management of its portfolio pursuant to the terms of a management agreement. We receive a monthly management fee in the amount of:
•
One-twelfth of 1.5% of the first $250 million of Orchid’s month-end equity, as defined in the management agreement,
•
One-twelfth of 1.25% of Orchid’s month-end equity that is greater than $250 million and less than or equal to $500 million, and
•
One-twelfth of 1.00% of Orchid’s month-end equity that is greater than $500 million.
In addition, Orchid is obligated to reimburse us for any direct expenses incurred on its behalf and to pay to us an amount equal to Orchid's pro rata portion of certain overhead costs set forth in the management agreement. The management agreement has been renewed through February 2022 and provides for automatic one-year extension options. Should Orchid terminate the management agreement without cause, it will be obligated to pay to us a termination fee equal to three times the average annual management fee, as defined in the management agreement, before or on the last day of the automatic renewal term.
The following table summarizes the advisory services revenue received from Orchid for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and each quarter during 2020 and 2019.
Investment Portfolio Segment
Net Portfolio Interest Income
We define net portfolio interest income as interest income on MBS less interest expense on repurchase agreement funding. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated $2.7 million of net portfolio interest income, consisting of $3.8 million of interest income from MBS assets offset by $1.1 million of interest expense on repurchase liabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated $3.3 million of net portfolio interest income, consisting of $7.9 million of interest income from MBS assets offset by $4.6 million of interest expense on repurchase liabilities. The $4.1 million decrease in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to a 75 basis point ("bp") increase in yields earned on the portfolio, combined with a $119.8 million decrease in average MBS balances. The $3.5 million decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to a 104 bp decrease in cost of funds, combined with a $111.8 million decrease in average repurchase liabilities.
Our economic interest expense on repurchase liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $3.7 million and $4.4 million, respectively, resulting in $0.1 million and $3.4 million of economic net portfolio interest income, respectively.
The tables below provide information on our portfolio average balances, interest income, yield on assets, average repurchase agreement balances, interest expense, cost of funds, net interest income and net interest rate spread for each quarter in 2020 and 2019 and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 on both a GAAP and economic basis.
(1)
Portfolio yields and costs of borrowings presented in the tables above and the tables on pages 48 and 49 are calculated based on the average balances of the underlying investment portfolio/repurchase agreement balances and are annualized for the periods presented.
(2)
Economic interest expense and economic net interest income presented in the tables above and the tables on page 49 include the effect of derivative instrument hedges for only the period presented.
(3)
Represents interest cost of our borrowings and the effect of derivative instrument hedges attributed to the period related to hedging activities divided by average MBS held.
(4)
Economic net interest spread is calculated by subtracting average economic cost of funds from yield on average MBS.
Interest Income and Average Earning Asset Yield
Our interest income was $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $7.9 million for year ended December 31, 2019. Average MBS holdings were $80.5 million and $200.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The $4.1 million decrease in interest income was due to a $119.8 million decrease in average MBS holdings, offset by a 75 bp increase in yields.
The table below presents the average portfolio size, income and yields of our respective sub-portfolios, consisting of structured MBS and pass-through MBS (“PT MBS”) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and each quarter during 2020 and 2019.
Interest Expense on Repurchase Agreements and the Cost of Funds
Our average outstanding repurchase agreements were $78.0 million and $189.9 million, generating interest expense of $1.1 million and $4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our average cost of funds was 1.38% and 2.42% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There was a 104 bp decrease in the average cost of funds and a $111.8 million decrease in average outstanding repurchase agreements during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Our economic interest expense was $3.7 million and $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There was a 236 bp increase in the average economic cost of funds to 4.70% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 2.34% for the previous year. The $0.7 million decrease in economic interest expense was due to a combination of the 104 bp decrease in the average cost of funds noted above and the $111.8 million decrease in average outstanding repurchase agreements during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Since all of our repurchase agreements are short-term, changes in market rates directly affect our interest expense. Our average cost of funds calculated on a GAAP basis was 10 bps above average one-month LIBOR and 2 bps below average six-month LIBOR for the quarter ended December 31, 2020. Our average economic cost of funds was 373 bps above average one-month LIBOR and 361 bps above average six-month LIBOR for the quarter ended December 31, 2020. The average term to maturity of the outstanding repurchase agreements increased from 24 days at December 31, 2019 to 33 days at December 31, 2020.
The tables below present the average outstanding balance under all repurchase agreements, interest expense and average economic cost of funds, and average one-month and six-month LIBOR rates for each quarter in 2020 and 2019 and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 on both a GAAP and economic basis.
Dividend Income
We owned 1,520,036 shares of Orchid common stock as of December 31, 2019. We acquired 1,075,321 additional shares during the year ended December 31, 2020, bringing our total ownership to 2,595,357 shares. Orchid paid total dividends of $0.79 per share during 2020 and $0.96 per share during 2019. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we received dividends on this common stock investment of approximately $1.8 million and $1.5 million, respectively.
Long-Term Debt
Junior Subordinated Debt
Interest expense on our junior subordinated debt securities was approximately $1.1 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The average rate of interest paid for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 4.22% compared to 5.94% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The junior subordinated debt securities pay interest at a floating rate. The rate is adjusted quarterly and set at a spread of 3.50% over the prevailing three-month LIBOR rate on the determination date. As of December 31, 2020, the interest rate was 3.72%.
Note Payable
On October 30, 2019, the Company borrowed $680,000 from a bank. The note is payable in equal monthly principal and interest installments of approximately $4,500 through October 30, 2039. Interest accrues at 4.89% through October 30, 2024. Thereafter, interest accrues based on the weekly average yield to the United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of 5 years, plus 3.25%. The note is secured by a mortgage on the Company’s office building.
Paycheck Protection Plan Loan
On April 13, 2020, the Company received approximately $152,000 through the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) of the CARES Act in the form of a low interest loan. PPP loans may be forgiven, in whole or in part, if the proceeds are used for payroll and other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements of the PPP and if certain other requirements are met. These loans carry a fixed rate of 1.00% and a term of two years, if not forgiven, in whole or in part. Payments are deferred for the first ten months after the completion of the loan forgiveness covered period.
Gains or Losses and Other Income
The table below presents our gains or losses and other income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
We invest in MBS with the intent to earn net income from the realized yield on those assets over their related funding and hedging costs, and not for the purpose of making short term gains from trading in these securities. However, we have sold, and may continue to sell, existing assets to acquire new assets, which our management believes might have higher risk-adjusted returns in light of current or anticipated interest rates, federal government programs or general economic conditions or to manage our balance sheet as part of our asset/liability management strategy. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received proceeds of $176.2 million from the sales of MBS compared to $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The fair value of our MBS portfolio and derivative instruments, and the gains (losses) reported on those financial instruments, are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table below presents historical interest rate data as of each quarter end during 2020 and 2019.

Operating Expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our total operating expenses were approximately $6.7 million compared to approximately $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The table below presents a breakdown of operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Financial Condition:
Mortgage-Backed Securities
As of December 31, 2020, our MBS portfolio consisted of $65.2 million of agency or government MBS at fair value and had a weighted average coupon of 3.89%. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received principal repayments of $13.9 million compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The average prepayment speeds for the quarters ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were 14.4% and 15.6%, respectively.
The following table presents the 3-month constant prepayment rate (“CPR”) experienced on our structured and PT MBS sub-portfolios, on an annualized basis, for the quarterly periods presented. CPR is a method of expressing the prepayment rate for a mortgage pool that assumes that a constant fraction of the remaining principal is prepaid each month or year. Specifically, the CPR in the chart below represents the three month prepayment rate of the securities in the respective asset category. Assets that were not owned for the entire quarter have been excluded from the calculation. The exclusion of certain assets during periods of high trading activity can create a very high, and often volatile, reliance on a small sample of underlying loans.
The following tables summarize certain characteristics of our PT MBS and structured MBS as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:
(1)
Effective duration is the approximate percentage change in price for a 100 bp change in rates. An effective duration of 3.309 indicates that an interest rate increase of 1.0% would be expected to cause a 3.309% decrease in the value of the MBS in our investment portfolio at December 31, 2020. An effective duration of 3.196 indicates that an interest rate increase of 1.0% would be expected to cause a 3.196% decrease in the value of the MBS in our investment portfolio at December 31, 2019. These figures include the structured securities in the portfolio but do include the effect of our funding cost hedges. Effective duration quotes for individual investments are obtained from The Yield Book, Inc.
The following table presents a summary of our portfolio assets acquired during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Our portfolio of PT MBS is typically comprised of adjustable-rate MBS, fixed-rate MBS and hybrid adjustable-rate MBS. We generally seek to acquire low duration assets that offer high levels of protection from mortgage prepayments provided that they are reasonably priced by the market. The stated contractual final maturity of the mortgage loans underlying our portfolio of PT MBS generally ranges up to 30 years. However, the effect of prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans tends to shorten the resulting cash flows from our investments substantially. Prepayments occur for various reasons, including refinancing of underlying mortgages, loan payoffs in connection with home sales, and borrowers paying more than their scheduled loan payments, which accelerates the amortization of the loans.
The duration of our IO and IIO portfolio will vary greatly depending on the structural features of the securities. While prepayment activity will always affect the cash flows associated with the securities, the interest only nature of IO’s may cause their durations to become extremely negative when prepayments are high, and less negative when prepayments are low. Prepayments affect the durations of IIO’s similarly, but the floating rate nature of the coupon of IIOs (which is inversely related to the level of one month LIBOR) cause their price movements - and model duration - to be affected by changes in both prepayments and one month LIBOR - both current and anticipated levels. As a result, the duration of IIO securities will also vary greatly.
Prepayments on the loans underlying our MBS can alter the timing of the cash flows received by us. As a result, we gauge the interest rate sensitivity of its assets by measuring their effective duration. While modified duration measures the price sensitivity of a bond to movements in interest rates, effective duration captures both the movement in interest rates and the fact that cash flows to a mortgage related security are altered when interest rates move. Accordingly, when the contract interest rate on a mortgage loan is substantially above prevailing interest rates in the market, the effective duration of securities collateralized by such loans can be quite low because of expected prepayments.
We face the risk that the market value of our PT MBS assets will increase or decrease at different rates than that of our structured MBS or liabilities, including our hedging instruments. Accordingly, we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the duration of our assets and the duration of our liabilities. We generally calculate duration and effective duration using various third-party models or obtain these quotes from third-parties. However, empirical results and various third-party models may produce different duration numbers for the same securities.
The following sensitivity analysis shows the estimated impact on the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive investments and hedge positions as of December 31, 2020, assuming rates instantaneously fall 100 bps, rise 100 bps and rise 200 bps, adjusted to reflect the impact of convexity, which is the measure of the sensitivity of our hedge positions and Agency MBS’ effective duration to movements in interest rates.
(1)
Represents the average contract/notional amount of Eurodollar futures contracts.
In addition to changes in interest rates, other factors impact the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive investments and hedging instruments, such as the shape of the yield curve, market expectations as to future interest rate changes and other market conditions. Accordingly, in the event of changes in actual interest rates, the change in the fair value of our assets would likely differ from that shown above and such difference might be material and adverse to our stockholders.
Repurchase Agreements
As of December 31, 2020, we had established borrowing facilities in the repurchase agreement market with a number of commercial banks and other financial institutions and had borrowings in place with five of these counterparties. We believe these facilities provide borrowing capacity in excess of our needs. None of these lenders are affiliated with the Company. These borrowings are secured by our MBS and cash.
As of December 31, 2020, we had obligations outstanding under the repurchase agreements of approximately $65.1 million with a net weighted average borrowing cost of 0.25%. The remaining maturity of our outstanding repurchase agreement obligations ranged from 6 to 133 days, with a weighted average maturity of 33 days. Securing the repurchase agreement obligation as of December 31, 2020 are MBS with an estimated fair value, including accrued interest, of $65.4 million and a weighted average maturity of 334 months, and cash posted as collateral of $3.4 million. Through March 15, 2021, we have been able to maintain our repurchase facilities with comparable terms to those that existed at December 31, 2020 with maturities through August 5, 2021.
The table below presents information about our period-end and average repurchase agreement obligations for each quarter in 2020 and 2019.
(1)
The higher ending balance relative to the average balance during the quarter ended September 30, 2020 reflects the increase in the portfolio. During the quarter ended September 30, 2020, the Company's investment in PT MBS increased $20.4 million.
(2)
The lower ending balance relative to the average balance during the quarter ended March 31, 2020 reflects the Company’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the Company's investment in PT MBS decreased $162.4 million.
(3)
The higher ending balance relative to the average balance during the quarter ended December 31, 2019 reflects the reinvestment of the portfolio. During the quarter ended December 31, 2019, the Company's investment in PT MBS increased $54.7 million.
(4)
The lower ending balance relative to the average balance during the quarter ended September 31, 2019 reflects the decrease in the portfolio to fund the July 2019 Tender Offer. During the quarter ended September 31, 2019, the Company's investment in PT MBS decreased $47.5 million.

Liquidity is our ability to turn non-cash assets into cash, purchase additional investments, repay principal and interest on borrowings, fund overhead and fulfill margin calls. Our primary immediate sources of liquidity include cash balances, unencumbered assets, the availability to borrow under repurchase agreements, and fees and dividends received from Orchid. Our borrowing capacity will vary over time as the market value of our interest earning assets varies. Our investments also generate liquidity on an on-going basis through payments of principal and interest we receive on our MBS portfolio. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we received U.S. Federal income tax refunds of approximately $1.4 million related to the 2018 tax year and approximately $0.2 million related to the 2019 tax year.
The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our liquidity, assets under management and operating results. As disclosed in detail elsewhere in this report, during March 2020, we significantly reduced our MBS assets to meet margin calls and repay debt. This reduction in our investment portfolio will impact our ability to generate income in the future. However, management believes that we currently have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for at least one year from the date of issuance of this Form 10-K for (a) the management of our existing MBS portfolio, (b) to service our management agreement to Orchid, (c) to make all scheduled payments on borrowings, (d) for the payment of overhead and operating expenses, and (e) the payment of other accrued obligations.
Our hedging strategy typically involves taking short positions in Eurodollar futures, T-Note futures, TBAs or other instruments. Since inception we have primarily used short positions in Eurodollar futures. When the market causes these short positions to decline in value we are required to meet margin calls with cash. This can reduce our liquidity position to the extent other securities in our portfolio move in price in such a way that we do not receive enough cash through margin calls to offset the Eurodollar related margin calls. If this were to occur in sufficient magnitude, the loss of liquidity might force us to reduce the size of the levered portfolio, pledge additional structured securities to raise funds or risk operating the portfolio with less liquidity.
Our master repurchase agreements have no stated expiration, but can be terminated at any time at our option or at the option of the counterparty. However, once a definitive repurchase agreement under a master repurchase agreement has been entered into, it generally may not be terminated by either party. A negotiated termination can occur, but may involve a fee to be paid by the party seeking to terminate the repurchase agreement transaction.
Under our repurchase agreement funding arrangements, we are required to post margin at the initiation of the borrowing. The margin posted represents the haircut, which is a percentage of the market value of the collateral pledged. To the extent the market value of the asset collateralizing the financing transaction declines, the market value of our posted margin will be insufficient and we will be required to post additional collateral. Conversely, if the market value of the asset pledged increases in value, we would be over collateralized and we would be entitled to have excess margin returned to us by the counterparty. Our lenders typically value our pledged securities daily to ensure the adequacy of our margin and make margin calls as needed, as do we. Typically, but not always, the parties agree to a minimum threshold amount for margin calls so as to avoid the need for nuisance margin calls on a daily basis. Our master repurchase agreements do not specify the haircut; rather haircuts are determined on an individual repurchase transaction basis.
As discussed above, we invest a portion of our capital in structured MBS. We generally do not apply leverage to this portion of our portfolio. The leverage inherent in structured securities replaces the leverage obtained by acquiring PT securities and funding them in the repurchase market. This structured MBS strategy has been a core element of the Company’s overall investment strategy since 2008. However, we have and may continue to pledge a portion of our structured MBS in order to raise our cash levels, but generally will not pledge these securities in order to acquire additional assets.
In future periods we expect to continue to finance our activities through repurchase agreements. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $7.6 million. We generated cash flows of $18.2 million from principal and interest payments on our MBS portfolio and had average repurchase agreements outstanding of $78.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we received approximately $6.8 million in management fees and expense reimbursements as manager of Orchid and approximately $1.8 million in dividends from our investment in Orchid common stock.
In order to generate additional cash to be invested in our MBS portfolio, on October 30, 2019, we obtained a $680,000 loan secured by a mortgage on the Company’s office property. The loan is payable in equal monthly principal and interest installments of approximately $4,500 through October 30, 2039. Interest accrued at 4.89%, through October 30, 2024. Thereafter, interest accrued based on the weekly average yield to the United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of five years, plus 3.25%. Net loan proceeds were approximately $651,000. In addition, during 2020, we completed the sale of real property that was not used in the Company’s business. The net proceeds from this sale were approximately $462,000.
On April 13, 2020, we received approximately $152,000 through the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) of the CARES Act in the form of a low interest loan. PPP loans may be forgiven, in whole or in part, if the proceeds are used for payroll and other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements of the PPP and if certain other requirements are met. These loans carry a fixed rate of 1.00% and a term of two years, if not forgiven, in whole or in part. Payments are deferred for the first six months of the loan. The Company believes that all of the proceeds were used for eligible purposes and the outstanding principal and accrued interest will ultimately be forgiven.
The table below summarizes the effect that certain future contractual obligations existing as of December 31, 2020 will have on our liquidity and cash flows.

Outlook
Orchid Island Capital Inc.
To the extent Orchid is able to increase its capital base over time, we will benefit via increased management fees. In addition, Orchid is obligated to reimburse us for direct expenses paid on its behalf and to pay to us Orchid’s pro rata share of overhead as defined in the management agreement. As a stockholder of Orchid, we will also continue to share in distributions, if any, paid by Orchid to its stockholders. Our operating results are also impacted by changes in the market value of our holdings of Orchid common shares, although these market value changes do not impact our cash flows from Orchid.
The independent Board of Directors of Orchid has the ability to terminate the management agreement and thus end our ability to collect management fees and share overhead costs. Should Orchid terminate the management agreement without cause, it will be obligated to pay us a termination fee equal to three times the average annual management fee, as defined in the management agreement, before or on the last day of the current automatic renewal term.
Economic Summary
COVID-19 related events dominated markets during the fourth quarter of 2020. The feared winter surge materialized, and new cases of COVID-19, hospitalizations and deaths exceeded the levels seen during the spring or summer surge in the Southern U.S., and by a considerable margin. This was the case both in the U.S. and across the globe. Perversely, as the effects of the pandemic spread, and it became clear the Federal government would need to pass another stimulus package to offset the effect of the pandemic on the economy, interest rates began to rise. While the yield on the benchmark ten-year U.S. Treasury Note was under 0.70% as the third quarter came to a close, the yield exceeded 0.90% by quarter end, and nearly hit 1.00% in November. The spike in yield in November followed the news that a vaccine with 90% effectiveness had been found and would become available by year end. The equity markets looked past the near-term negative impacts of the pandemic on economic activity and rallied, as investors focused on a potential return to normalcy in 2021 and beyond. However, the effects of the pandemic on economic activity did indeed take hold as the quarter unfolded. The labor market recovery reversed somewhat, and initial unemployment claims started to increase again. Retail sales, having rebounded so strongly over the summer and fall, declined. These events overshadowed the national elections in early November.
As the election approached, polls indicated a potential “Blue Wave” where Democrats would sweep the elections, winning the presidential election and gaining control of both houses of Congress. Markets expected a substantially larger stimulus package if this outcome was realized than would be likely under Republican control. This potential outcome also buoyed equity markets and risk sentiment. Once the outcome of the election was known, it became clear the “Blue Wave” failed to materialize, although there was to be a run-off election for two Senate seats in Georgia on January 5, 2021. While this left open the possibility Democrats could control the presidency and both houses of Congress, it was not considered the likely outcome. Further, the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives shrank and the presidential election outcome was much closer than polls indicated. The “Blue Wave” did not come to pass. This outcome tempered market enthusiasm for an outsized stimulus package in 2021 and market attention refocused on the prospects for a stimulus package before year end. This ultimately came to pass with strong bipartisan support in the form of a $900 billion stimulus bill signed by President Trump in late December.
On January 5, 2021, the Democrats won both Senate seats in the run-off election and the “Blue Wave,” while more of a wavelet, was realized after all. The Senate was split 50/50 between Republicans and Democrats with the Vice-President able to break any ties in the favor of Democrats. Interest rates spiked as the prospects for additional stimulus were resurrected. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury Note broke above 1.00% and nearly reached 1.20% before retreating, settling into a range between approximately 1.02% and 1.15%. This range did not hold for long and rates have since moved higher still, surpassing 1.50% in March. After early troubles with the roll-out of the vaccine, inoculations accelerated and risk sentiment improved as the new year unfolded. Equity markets reached new all-time high levels, and the slope of the U.S. Treasury curve steepened as the market anticipated the out-sized fiscal stimulus would stimulate inflation. The repeated statements from Fed officials that they would be very patient in removing accommodation reinforced market sentiment and risk tolerance increased.
Legislative Response and the Federal Reserve
Congress passed the CARES Act (described below) quickly in response to the pandemic’s emergence in the spring of 2020 and followed with additional legislation over the ensuing months. However, as certain provisions of the CARES Act have expired, such as supplemental unemployment insurance at the end of July, there appeared to be a need for additional stimulus for the economy to deal with the surge in the pandemic that occurred as cold weather set in, particularly over the Christmas holiday. As mentioned above, the Federal government eventually passed an additional stimulus package in late December. In addition, the Fed has provided, and continues to provide, as much support to the markets and the economy as it can within the constraints of its mandate. During the third quarter of 2020, the Fed unveiled a new monetary policy framework focused on average inflation rate targeting that allows the Fed Funds rate to remain quite low, even if inflation is expected to temporarily surpass the 2% target level. Further, the Fed will look past the presence of very tight labor markets, should they be present at the time. This marks a significant shift from their prior policy framework, which was focused on the unemployment rate as a key indicator of impending inflation. Adherence to this policy could steepen the U.S. Treasury curve as short-term rates could remain low for a considerable period but longer-term rates could rise given the Fed’s intention to let inflation potentially run above 2% in the future as the economy more fully recovers. As mentioned above, this appears to be occurring early in 2021 now that effective vaccines have been found and inoculations are distributed to the most vulnerable amongst the population.
Interest Rates
Interest rates steadily increased throughout the fourth quarter as described above although levels of implied volatility remain very low by historical norms. Mortgage rates continued to slowly decline into year-end as originators added capacity and could handle ever increasing levels of production volume. As a result, the spread between rates available to borrowers and the implied yield on a current coupon mortgage, known as the Primary/Secondary spread, has continued to compress. The spread is still slightly above long-term average levels so further compression is possible, meaning rates available to borrowers can remain at current levels even if U.S. Treasury rates increased. To date, interest rates have continued to increase during the first quarter of 2021, with the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate surpassing 1.60% in early March. Rates available to borrowers have increased during the quarter, although less so than treasury rates, implying the primary/secondary spread is continuing to compress. Prepayment speeds released during the first quarter of 2021 for January and February have not shown any significant slowing since they reflect rates available to borrowers before the recent run-up in interest rates. The effect of the recent increase in rates will be felt in the months to come.
The Agency MBS Market
The Agency MBS market continues to be essentially bifurcated with two separate and distinct sub-markets. Lower coupon fixed rate mortgages, coupons of 1.5% through 2.5%, are purchased by the Fed. Fed purchase activity maintains substantial price pressure under these coupons, and they benefit from attractive TBA dollar roll drops. Higher coupons in the TBA market do not have the benefit of Fed purchases and trade poorly. Importantly, the Fed tends to take the worst performing collateral out of the market. The absence of Fed purchases of higher coupons means the market is left to absorb very high prepayment speeds on these securities. For these coupons, specified pools are in very high demand and continue to trade at very high premiums. These premiums have ceased rising as interest rates have begun to increase, although they remain at very high levels by historical standards. The market expects prepayments on higher coupons will eventually decline as “burn out” sets in - a phenomenon whereby refinancing activity declines as borrowers are exposed to refinancing incentives for an extended period of time. Through the February prepayment report released in early March of 2021, this has yet to meaningfully occur.
Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments
The Fed conducted large scale overnight repo operations from late 2019 until July 2020 to address disruptions in the U.S. Treasury, Agency debt and Agency MBS financing markets. These operations ceased in July 2020 after the central bank successfully tamed volatile funding costs that had threatened to cause disruption across the financial system.
The Fed has taken a number of other actions to stabilize markets as a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 15, 2020, the Fed announced a $700 billion asset purchase program to provide liquidity to the U.S. Treasury and Agency MBS markets. Specifically, the Fed announced that it would purchase at least $500 billion of U.S. Treasuries and at least $200 billion of Agency MBS. The Fed also lowered the Fed Funds rate to a range of 0.0% - 0.25%, after having already lowered the Fed Funds rate by 50 bps on March 3, 2020. On June 30, 2020, Fed Chairman Powell announced expectations to maintain interest rates at this level until the Fed is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve maximum employment and price stability goals. The Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) has continued to reaffirm this commitment at all subsequent meetings through January of 2021, as well as an intention to allow inflation to climb modestly above their 2% target and maintain that level for a period sufficient for inflation to average 2% long term.
In response to the deterioration in the markets for U.S. Treasuries, Agency MBS and other mortgage and fixed income markets as investors liquidated investments in response to the economic crisis resulting from the actions to contain and minimize the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 23, 2020, the Fed announced a program to acquire U.S. Treasuries and Agency MBS in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning. With these purchases, market conditions improved substantially, and in early April, the Fed began to gradually reduce the pace of these purchases. Currently, the Fed is committed to purchasing $80 billion of U.S. Treasuries and $40 billion of Agency MBS each month. Chairman Powell and the Fed have reiterated their commitment to this level of asset purchases at every meeting since their meeting on June 30, 2020, including their most recent meeting in January of 2021. Since March 2020, the Fed has taken various other steps to support certain other fixed income markets, to support mortgage servicers and to implement various portions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act.
The CARES Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Trump on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act provided many forms of direct support to individuals and small businesses in order to stem the steep decline in economic activity. This over $2 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, among other things, provided for direct payments to each American making up to $75,000 a year, increased unemployment benefits for up to four months (on top of state benefits), funding to hospitals and health providers, loans and investments to businesses, states and municipalities and grants to the airline industry. On April 24, 2020, President Trump signed an additional funding bill into law that provides an additional $484 billion of funding to individuals, small businesses, hospitals, health care providers and additional coronavirus testing efforts. Various provisions of the CARES Act began to expire in July 2020, including a moratorium on evictions (July 25, 2020), expanded unemployment benefits (July 31, 2020), and a moratorium on foreclosures (August 31, 2020). On August 8, 2020, President Trump issued Executive Order 13945, directing the Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Department of the Treasury to take measures to temporarily halt residential evictions and foreclosures, including through temporary financial assistance.
On December 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law an additional $900 billion coronavirus aid package as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, providing for extensions of many of the CARES Act policies and programs as well as additional relief. The package provided for, among other things, direct payments to most Americans with a gross income of less than $75,000 a year, extension of unemployment benefits through March 14, 2021, funding for procurement of vaccines and health providers, loans to qualified businesses, funding for rental assistance and funding for schools. On January 19, 2021, the CDC issued guidance extending eviction moratoriums for covered persons through March 31, 2021. In addition, on February 9, 2021, the FHFA announced that the foreclosure moratorium begun under the CARES Act for loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the eviction moratorium for real estate owned by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were extended until March 31, 2021. On February 16, 2021, the U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department announced the extension of the FHA eviction and foreclosure moratorium to June 30, 2021.
In January 2019, the Trump administration made statements of its plans to work with Congress to overhaul Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and expectations to announce a framework for the development of a policy for comprehensive housing finance reform. On September 30, 2019, the FHFA announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were allowed to increase their capital buffers to $25 billion and $20 billion, respectively, from the prior limit of $3 billion each. This step could ultimately lead to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac being privatized and represents the first concrete step on the road to GSE reform. On June 30, 2020, the FHFA released a proposed rule on a new regulatory framework for the GSEs which seeks to implement both a risk-based capital framework and minimum leverage capital requirements. The final rule on the new capital framework for the GSEs was published in the federal register in December 2020. On January 14, 2021, the U.S. Treasury and the FHFA executed letter agreements allowing the GSEs to continue to retain capital up to their regulatory minimums, including buffers, as prescribed in the December rule. These letter agreements provide, in part, (i) there will be no exit from conservatorship until all material litigation is settled and the GSE has common equity Tier 1 capital of at least 3% of its assets, (ii) the GSEs will comply with the FHFA’s regulatory capital framework, (iii) higher-risk single-family mortgage acquisitions will be restricted to current levels, and (iv) the U.S. Treasury and the FHFA will establish a timeline and process for future GSE reform. However, no definitive proposals or legislation have been released or enacted with respect to ending the conservatorship, unwinding the GSEs, or materially reducing the roles of the GSEs in the U.S. mortgage market.
In 2017, policymakers announced that LIBOR will be replaced by December 31, 2021. The directive was spurred by the fact that banks are uncomfortable contributing to the LIBOR panel given the shortage of underlying transactions on which to base levels and the liability associated with submitting an unfounded level. However, the ICE Benchmark Administration, in its capacity as administrator of USD LIBOR, has announced that it intends to extend publication of USD LIBOR (other than one-week and two-month tenors) by 18 months to June 2023. Notwithstanding this possible extension, a joint statement by key regulatory authorities calls on banks to cease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate by no later than December 31, 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, has proposed replacing USD-LIBOR with a new SOFR, a rate based on U.S. repo trading. Many banks believe that it may take four to five years to complete the transition to SOFR despite the 2021 deadline. We will monitor the emergence of this new rate carefully as it will potentially become the new benchmark for hedges and a range of interest rate investments. At this time, however, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR.
Effective January 1, 2021, Fannie Mae, in alignment with Freddie Mac, will extend the timeframe for its delinquent loan buyout policy for Single-Family Uniform Mortgage-Backed Securities (UMBS) and Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) from four consecutively missed monthly payments to twenty-four consecutively missed monthly payments (i.e., 24 months past due). This new timeframe will apply to outstanding single-family pools and newly issued single-family pools and was first reflected when January 2021 factors were released on the fourth business day in February 2021.
For Agency MBS investors, when a delinquent loan is bought out of a pool of mortgage loans, the removal of the loan from the pool is the same as a total prepayment of the loan. The respective GSEs currently anticipate, however, that delinquent loans will be repurchased in most cases before the 24-month deadline under one of the following exceptions:
• a loan that is paid in full, or where the related lien is released and/or the note debt is satisfied or forgiven;
• a loan repurchased by a seller/servicer under applicable selling and servicing requirements;
•
a loan entering a permanent modification, which generally requires it to be removed from the MBS. During any modification trial period, the loan will remain in the MBS until the trial period ends;
• a loan subject to a short sale or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure; or
• a loan referred to foreclosure.
Because of these exceptions, the GSEs currently believe based on prevailing assumptions and market conditions this change will have only a marginal impact on prepayment speeds, in aggregate. Cohort level impacts may vary. For example, more than half of loans referred to foreclosure are historically referred within six months of delinquency. The degree to which speeds are affected depends on delinquency levels, borrower response, and referral to foreclosure timelines.
The scope and nature of the actions the U.S. government or the Fed will ultimately undertake are unknown and will continue to evolve, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, President Biden’s new administration and the new Congress in the United States.
Effect on Us
Regulatory developments, movements in interest rates and prepayment rates affect us in many ways, including the following:
Effects on our Assets
A change in or elimination of the guarantee structure of Agency MBS may increase our costs (if, for example, guarantee fees increase) or require us to change our investment strategy altogether. For example, the elimination of the guarantee structure of Agency MBS may cause us to change our investment strategy to focus on non-Agency MBS, which in turn would require us to significantly increase our monitoring of the credit risks of our investments in addition to interest rate and prepayment risks.
Lower long-term interest rates can affect the value of our Agency MBS in a number of ways. If prepayment rates are relatively low (due, in part, to the refinancing problems described above), lower long-term interest rates can increase the value of higher-coupon Agency MBS. This is because investors typically place a premium on assets with yields that are higher than market yields. Although lower long-term interest rates may increase asset values in our portfolio, we may not be able to invest new funds in similarly-yielding assets.
If prepayment levels increase, the value of our Agency MBS affected by such prepayments may decline. This is because a principal prepayment accelerates the effective term of an Agency MBS, which would shorten the period during which an investor would receive above-market returns (assuming the yield on the prepaid asset is higher than market yields). Also, prepayment proceeds may not be able to be reinvested in similar-yielding assets. Agency MBS backed by mortgages with high interest rates are more susceptible to prepayment risk because holders of those mortgages are most likely to refinance to a lower rate. IOs and IIOs, however, may be the types of Agency MBS most sensitive to increased prepayment rates. Because the holder of an IO or IIO receives no principal payments, the values of IOs and IIOs are entirely dependent on the existence of a principal balance on the underlying mortgages. If the principal balance is eliminated due to prepayment, IOs and IIOs essentially become worthless. Although increased prepayment rates can negatively affect the value of our IOs and IIOs, they have the opposite effect on POs. Because POs act like zero-coupon bonds, meaning they are purchased at a discount to their par value and have an effective interest rate based on the discount and the term of the underlying loan, an increase in prepayment rates would reduce the effective term of our POs and accelerate the yields earned on those assets, which would increase our net income.
Higher long-term rates can also affect the value of our Agency MBS. As long-term rates rise, rates available to borrowers also rise. This tends to cause prepayment activity to slow and extend the expected average life of mortgage cash flows. As the expected average life of the mortgage cash flows increases, coupled with higher discount rates, the value of Agency MBS declines. Some of the instruments the Company uses to hedge our Agency MBS assets, such as Euro Dollar futures, swaps, interest rate futures and swaptions, are stable average life instruments. This means that to the extent we use such instruments to hedge our Agency MBS assets, our hedges may not adequately protect us from price declines, and therefore may negatively impact our book value. It is for this reason we use interest only securities in our portfolio. As interest rates rise, the expected average life of these securities increases, causing generally positive price movements as the number and size of the cash flows increase the longer the underlying mortgages remain outstanding. This makes interest only securities desirable hedge instruments for pass-through Agency MBS.
As described above, the Agency MBS market began to experience severe dislocations in mid-March 2020 as a result of the economic, health and market turmoil brought about by COVID-19. On March 23, 2020, the Fed announced that it would purchase Agency MBS and U.S. Treasuries in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, which largely stabilized the Agency MBS market, a commitment it reaffirmed on June 30, 2020, September 16, 2020, December 16, 2020 and January 27, 2021. If the Fed modifies, reduces or suspends its purchases of Agency MBS, our investment portfolio could be negatively impacted. Further, the moratoriums on foreclosures and evictions described above will likely delay potential defaults on loans that would otherwise be bought out of Agency MBS pools as described above. Depending on the ultimate resolution of the foreclosure or evictions, when and if it occurs, these loans may be removed from the pool into which they were securitized. If this were to occur, it would have the effect of delaying a prepayment on the Company’s securities until such time. As the majority of the Company’s Agency MBS assets were acquired at a premium to par, this will tend to increase the realized yield on the asset in question.
Because we base our investment decisions on risk management principles rather than anticipated movements in interest rates, in a volatile interest rate environment we may allocate more capital to structured Agency MBS with shorter durations, such as short-term fixed and floating rate CMOs. We believe these securities have a lower sensitivity to changes in long-term interest rates than other asset classes. We may attempt to mitigate our exposure to changes in long-term interest rates by investing in IOs and IIOs, which typically have different sensitivities to changes in long-term interest rates than PT MBS, particularly PT MBS backed by fixed-rate mortgages.
Effects on our borrowing costs
We leverage our PT MBS portfolio and a portion of our structured Agency MBS with principal balances through the use of short-term repurchase agreement transactions. The interest rates on our debt are determined by market levels of both the Federal Funds Rate and LIBOR. An increase in the Federal Funds Rate or LIBOR would increase our borrowing costs, which could affect our interest rate spread if there is no corresponding increase in the interest we earn on our assets. This would be most prevalent with respect to our Agency MBS backed by fixed rate mortgage loans because the interest rate on a fixed-rate mortgage loan does not change even though market rates may change.
In order to protect our net interest margin against increases in short-term interest rates, we may enter into interest rate swaps, which economically convert our floating-rate repurchase agreement debt to fixed-rate debt, or utilize other hedging instruments such as Eurodollar, Fed Funds and T-Note futures contracts or interest rate swaptions.
Summary
COVID-19 continues to dominate the performance of the markets and economy. While both have recovered from the depths of March 2020, especially the financial markets, the economy continues to languish. The recovery has proven to be very uneven, with some sectors back to or near pre-pandemic levels of activity while others remain far below with little prospect for getting back to those levels soon. The unemployment rate remains elevated - with the most recent read at 6.2% - as over nine million Americans remain out of work.
The Fed has taken, and continues to take, steps to support markets and the economy. Stimulus from Washington and the federal government, in spite of political hurdles and a change in presidential administrations, has also provided meaningful support. The new Biden administration has proposed another $1.9 trillion stimulus package that is currently making its way through Congress. The market expects the Fed Funds rate to remain at the effective lower bound near zero for an extended period of time. Henceforth, the Fed appears to be willing to let inflation run above the 2% target level, even when unemployment is very low, before removing accommodation.
The Agency MBS market continues to be bifurcated between the production coupons - the target of Fed asset purchases - and higher coupons in specified pool form. The TBA market for higher coupons remains weak as the sector lacks support from the Fed and prepayment speeds are extremely high, resulting in poor expected returns for investors. This leads investors to look to the specified pool market - with lower expected prepayment speeds - for attractive returns. With rates moving higher since the end of 2020 investors anticipate prepayment activity will diminish as borrowers have been exposed to refinancing incentives for such an extended period, but this has yet to materialize. Working against the burnout effect is compression of the primary/secondary spread, keeping mortgage rates low even as U.S. Treasury rates have increased. As interest rates have continued to increase during the first quarter of 2021, rates available to borrowers have risen as well and now exceed 3%, although the increase in mortgage rates has been less than the increase in treasury rates, implying the primary/secondary spread has continued to compress.
Now that we are closer to containment of the COVID-19 pandemic with the emergence of several very effective vaccines, market participants expect the economy will fully recover over the next year or two. Interest rates have begun to drift higher and are likely to continue to do so absent an unexpected turn in efforts to contain the pandemic. Nonetheless, the Fed has stated that it will stay committed to providing maximum support to the economy and Washington continues to provide fiscal stimulus, albeit subject to considerable political haggling that slows progress. Prepayment speeds for Agency MBS will likely remain elevated until interest rates move well above current levels, and we expect that the most attractive returns available will be either in the TBA dollar roll market with lower coupons or with specified pools in higher coupons.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires our management to make some complex and subjective decisions and assessments. Our most critical accounting policies involve decisions and assessments which could significantly affect reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management has identified the following as its most critical accounting estimates:
Mortgage-Backed Securities
Our investments in MBS are accounted for at fair value. We acquire our MBS for the purpose of generating long-term returns, and not for the short-term investment of idle capital. Changes in the fair value of securities are reflected as part of our net income or loss in our consolidated statement of operations. We elected to account for all of our MBS at fair value to reflect changes in the fair value of our MBS in our consolidated statement of operations, which we believe more appropriately reflects the results of our operations for a particular reporting period.
Our MBS are valued based on independent pricing sources and/or third party broker quotes when available. Because the price estimates may vary, management must make certain judgments and assumptions about the appropriate price to use to calculate the fair values. Alternatively, the Company could opt to have the value of all of our positions in MBS determined by either an independent third-party or do so internally. In managing our portfolio, the Company employs the following four-step process at each valuation date to determine the fair value of our MBS.
•
First, the Company obtains fair values from subscription-based independent pricing services.
•
Second, the Company requests non-binding quotes from one to four broker-dealers for certain MBS in order to validate the values obtained by the pricing service. The Company requests these quotes from broker-dealers that actively trade and make markets in the respective asset class for which the quote is requested.
•
Third, the Company reviews the values obtained by the pricing source and the broker-dealers for consistency across similar assets.
•
Finally, if the data from the pricing services and broker-dealers is not homogenous or if the data obtained is inconsistent with management’s market observations, the Company makes a judgment to determine which price appears the most consistent with observed prices from similar assets and selects that price. To the extent management believes that none of the prices are consistent with observed prices for similar assets, which is typically the case for only an immaterial portion of our portfolio each quarter, the Company may use a third price that is consistent with observed prices for identical or similar assets. In the case of assets that have quoted prices such as Agency MBS backed by fixed-rate mortgages, the Company generally uses the quoted or observed market price. For assets such as Agency MBS backed by ARMs or structured Agency MBS, the Company may determine the price based on the yield or spread that is identical to an observed transaction or a similar asset for which a dealer mark or subscription-based price has been obtained.
Income Recognition
All of our MBS are either PT MBS or structured MBS, including CMOs, IOs, IIOs or POs. Income on PT MBS, POs and CMOs that contain principal balances is based on the stated interest rate of the security. As a result of accounting for our MBS under the fair value option, premium or discount present at the date of purchase is not amortized. For IOs, IIOs and CMOs that do not contain principal balances, income is accrued based on the carrying value and the effective yield. As cash is received it is first applied to accrued interest and then to reduce the carrying value of the security. At each reporting date, the effective yield is adjusted prospectively from the reporting period based on the new estimate of prepayments, current interest rates and current asset prices. The new effective yield is calculated based on the carrying value at the end of the previous reporting period, the new prepayment estimates and the contractual terms of the security. Changes in fair value of all of our MBS during the period are recorded in earnings and reported as unrealized gains or losses on mortgage-backed securities in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. For IIO securities, effective yield and income recognition calculations also take into account the index value applicable to the security.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are provided for using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. The measurement of net deferred tax assets is adjusted by a valuation allowance if, based on the Company’s evaluation, it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. A majority of the Company’s net deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of NOLs, are expected to be realized over an extended number of years. Management’s conclusion is supported by taxable income projections which include forecasts of management fees, Orchid dividends and net interest income, and the subsequent reinvestment of those amounts into the MBS portfolio. However, management reassesses its valuation allowance conclusions whenever there is a material change in taxable income projections.
Capital Expenditures
At December 31, 2020, we had no material commitments for capital expenditures.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
At December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Inflation
Virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more so than does inflation. Changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates. Our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost and/or fair market value without considering inflation.
