Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations:
The purpose of this analysis is to provide the reader with information relevant to understanding and assessing the Company’s results of operations for each of the past three years and financial condition for each of the past two years. In order to fully appreciate this analysis, the reader is encouraged to review the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto appearing under Item 8 of this report, and statistical data presented in this document.
Overview
Unity Bancorp, Inc. (the “Parent Company”) is a bank holding company incorporated in New Jersey and is registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. Its wholly-owned subsidiary, Unity Bank (the “Bank” or, when consolidated with the Parent Company, the “Company”) is chartered by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance. The Bank provides a full range of commercial and retail banking services through the Internet and its nineteen branch offices located in Bergen, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Somerset, Union and Warren counties in New Jersey, and Northampton County in Pennsylvania. These services include the acceptance of demand, savings, and time deposits and the extension of consumer, real estate, Small Business Administration ("SBA") and other commercial credits.
Results of Operations
Net income totaled $23.6 million, or $2.19 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $23.7 million, or $2.14 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Highlights for the year include:
● Net income before tax increased 2.7 percent to $31.1 million from $30.3 million in the prior year.
● Net interest income increased $6.8 million or 11.9 percent to $64.4 million from $57.6 million in the prior year, due to SBA PPP loans, commercial loan growth and a reduction in the cost of funds.
● Net interest margin decreased 10 basis points to 3.85 percent compared to 3.95 percent in the prior year. The decrease was a direct result of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve Board in response to COVID-19.
● Noninterest income was $12.9 million, a $3.4 million increase compared to $9.5 million in the prior year, primarily due to increased gains on mortgage loan sales.
● Noninterest expense totaled $39.3 million, an increase of $4.6 million when compared to $34.7 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to increased consulting expenses incurred in connection with compliance with our Consent Order with the FDIC and NJDOBI and increased compensation due to increased mortgage commissions.
● The effective tax rate increased to 24.0 percent compared to 22.0 percent in the prior year.
● A 14.2 percent increase in total loans driven by a 79.7 percent increase in SBA loans, which reflects $118.3 million from the funding of SBA PPP loans, a 9.8 percent increase in commercial loans and a 6.8 percent increase in consumer loans.
● A 24.6 percent increase in total deposits with a 64.3 percent increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and a 28.3 percent increase in interest-bearing demand deposits.
The Company’s performance ratios for the past three years are listed in the following table:
(1) Defined as net income divided by weighted average shares outstanding.
(2) Defined as net income divided by the sum of weighted average shares and the potential dilutive impact of the exercise of outstanding options.
(3) Defined as net income divided by average shareholders’ equity.
(4) The efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure of operational performance. It is defined as noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income less any gains or losses on securities.
COVID-19
On March 13, 2020, the Coronavirus Disease (“COVID-19”) pandemic was declared a national emergency by the President of the United States. The spread of COVID-19 has negatively impacted the national and local economy, disrupted supply chains and increased unemployment levels. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many businesses have been faced with restrictions in an effort to prioritize public health. The initial temporary closure and gradual reopening of many businesses and the implementation of social distancing and stay-at-home policies has and will continue to impact many of the Company’s customers. COVID-19 continues to aggressively spread globally and in the United States.
The Company is committed to supporting its customers, employees and communities during this difficult time and has adapted to the changing environment. We have taken and continue taking steps to protect the health and safety of our employees and to work with our customers experiencing economic consequences from the epidemic. The Company has and is working with its loan customers to provide short term payment deferrals and to waive certain fees. These accommodations are likely to have a negative impact on the Company’s results of operations during the duration of the
epidemic, and, depending on how quickly the businesses of our customers rebound after the emergency, could lead to an increase in nonperforming assets.
The full impact of the pandemic is unknown and rapidly evolving. The outbreak is having a significant adverse impact on certain industries the Company serves, including retail, accommodations, and restaurants and food services. While most states have re-opened, it is under limited capacities and under other social-distancing restrictions, which have resulted in lower commercial activity and consumer spending. This decrease in commercial activity may result in our customers' inability to meet their loan obligations to us. In addition, the economic pressures and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in changes in consumer spending behaviors, which may negatively impact the demand for loans and other services we offer. Because of the significant uncertainties related to the ultimate duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our customers and prospects, and on the local and national economy, there can be no assurances as to how the crisis may ultimately affect the Company's loan portfolio, and business as a whole. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including when the coronavirus can be controlled and abated and whether the gradual reopening of businesses will result in a meaningful increase in economic activity. As such, the Company could be subject to certain risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.
CARES Act
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was signed into law. It contains substantial tax and spending provisions intended to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act includes a range of other provisions designed to support the U.S. economy and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on financial institutions and their customers, including through the authorization of various relief programs and measures that the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Small Business Administration, the Federal Reserve Board (“FRB”) and other federal banking agencies have implemented or may implement.
The CARES Act provides assistance to small businesses through the establishment of the Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP"). The PPP generally provides small businesses with funds to pay up to 24 weeks of payroll costs, including certain benefits. The funds are provided in the form of loans that may be fully or partially forgiven when used for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. The payments on these loans will be deferred for up to six months. Loans made after June 5, 2020, mature in five years, and loans made prior to June 5, 2020, mature in two years but can be extended to five years if the lender agrees. Forgiveness of the PPP loans is based on the employer maintaining or quickly rehiring employees and maintaining salary levels. Most small businesses with 500 or fewer employees are eligible. Applications for the PPP loans started on April 3, 2020 and the application period was extended to August 8, 2020, and then reopened pursuant to the terms of the Economic Aid Act discussed below. As an existing SBA 7(a) lender, the Company has opted to participate in the program.
The Company approved 1,224 applications and provided fundings of approximately $143.0 million. The Company has $118.3 million of PPP loans remaining on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and believes that the majority of these loans will be forgiven by the SBA.
Economic Aid Act
On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues (“Economic Aid”) Act was signed into law. It provides additional assistance to the hardest-hit small businesses, nonprofits, and venues that are struggling to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Economic Aid Act provides funding for a second round of PPP loans for small businesses and nonprofits experiencing significant revenue losses, makes programmatic improvements to PPP, funds grants to shuttered venues, and enacts emergency enhancements to other SBA lending programs.
The PPP now allows certain eligible borrowers that previously received a PPP loan to apply for a Second Draw PPP Loan with the same general loan terms as their First Draw PPP Loan, and for borrowers that did not initially receive a PPP loan to apply for one. Most small businesses with 300 or fewer employees that can demonstrate at least a 25% reduction in gross receipts between comparable quarters in 2019 and 2020 are eligible. Applications for PPP loans under the Economic Aid Act started on January 13, 2021 and are available until March 31, 2021. The Company is participating in the re-opened PPP loan process.
Deferrals
On March 22, 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued an “Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus.” This guidance encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers that may be unable to meet their contractual obligations because of the effects of COVID-19. The guidance goes on to explain that, in consultation with the FASB staff, the federal bank regulatory agencies concluded that short-term modifications (e.g. six months) made on a good faith basis to borrowers who were current as of the implementation date of a relief program are not TDRs. Section 4013 of the CARES Act also addresses COVID-19 related modifications and specifies that COVID-19 related modifications on loans that were current as of December 31, 2019, are not TDRs.
In March 2020, the Company proactively communicated with its customers to address their financial needs. The Company worked closely with its customers to educate and guide them on their options for financial assistance, including disaster loans, the PPP and payment relief through deferrals and waived fees. As a result of our proactive approach to provide financial assistance to our customers, loans have been modified through payment deferrals and are not categorized as TDRs, in accordance with regulatory guidance and the CARES Act. The table below summarizes the loans that are in deferral as of December 31, 2020:
Consent Order
In July 2020, Unity Bank agreed to the issuance of a Consent Order by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and agreed to an Acknowledgement and Consent of the FDIC Consent Order with the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance for the State of New Jersey. The Consent Order requires the Bank to strengthen its Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”)/anti-money laundering (“AML”) program, and to address related matters. The Bank hired a consulting firm to assist management in effectively addressing all matters pertaining to the order. Although the Bank believes it is complying with all requirements of the Consent Order, we can give no assurance that the FDIC and the NJDOBI will agree that the Bank is fully complying or that the Bank will not incur material additional expense in complying with the Consent Order.
Net Interest Income
The primary source of the Company’s operating income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest and dividends earned on earning assets and fees earned on loans, and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Earning assets include loans to individuals and businesses, investment securities, interest-earning deposits and federal funds sold.
Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing checking, savings and time deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") advances and other borrowings. Net interest income is determined by the difference between the yields earned on earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities (“net interest spread”) and the relative amounts of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The Company’s net interest spread is affected by regulatory, economic and competitive factors that influence interest rates, loan demand, deposit flows and general levels of nonperforming assets.
COVID-19 has and will continue to adversely affect economic activity globally, nationally and locally. Following the COVID-19 outbreak, market interest rates have declined significantly, with the 10-year Treasury bond falling below 1.00% on March 3, 2020 for the first time. Additionally, the Federal Open Market Committee reduced the target federal funds rate to 0% to 0.25% on March 16, 2020. These reductions in interest rates and other effects of the COVID-19 outbreak may adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations.
2020 compared to 2019
Tax-equivalent net interest income amounted to $64.4 million in 2020, an increase of $6.8 million from $57.6 million in 2019. The Company’s net interest margin decreased 10 basis points to 3.85 percent in 2020, compared to 3.95 percent in 2019. The net interest spread was 3.48 percent, a decrease of 6 basis points from 3.54 percent in 2019.
During 2020, tax-equivalent interest income was $78.9 million, an increase of $3.2 million or 4.3 percent when compared to 2019. This increase was driven primarily by the increase in the average volume of loans:
● Of the $3.2 million increase in interest income on a tax-equivalent basis, $8.6 million was due to the increased volume of earning assets, partially offset by a $5.4 million decrease in yields on average interest-earning assets.
● The yield on interest-earning assets decreased 47 basis points to 4.71 percent in 2020 when compared to 2019.
● The average volume of interest-earning assets increased $214.4 million to $1.7 billion in 2020 compared to $1.5 billion in 2019. This was due primarily to a $197.2 million increase in average loans, primarily SBA, PPP, commercial, residential mortgage and consumer loans, and a $25.2 million increase in average federal funds and interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a $8.0 million decrease in average investment securities.
Total interest expense was $14.5 million in 2020, a decrease of $3.6 million or 19.8 percent compared to 2019. This decrease was driven by the decreased rates on interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by an increase in the average volume of interest-bearing deposits:
● Of the $3.6 million decrease in interest expense, $4.8 million was due to decreased rates on interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by an increase of $1.2 million in the volume of average interest-bearing liabilities.
● The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 41 basis points to 1.23 percent in 2020 when compared to 2019. The cost of interest-bearing deposits and borrowed funds and subordinated debentures decreased 41 basis points and 35 basis points, respectively, in 2020.
● Interest-bearing liabilities averaged $1.2 billion in 2020, an increase of $75.7 million or 6.9 percent, compared to 2019. The increase in interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to an overall increase in time, savings, and interest-bearing demand deposits.
2019 compared to 2018
Tax-equivalent net interest income amounted to $57.6 million in 2019, an increase of $3.8 million from $53.8 million in 2018. The Company’s net interest margin decreased 2 basis points to 3.95 percent in 2019, compared to 3.97 percent in 2018. The net interest spread was 3.54 percent, a decrease of 11 basis points from 3.65 percent in 2018.
During 2019, tax-equivalent interest income was $75.7 million, an increase of $8.4 million or 12.5 percent when compared to 2018. This increase was driven primarily by the increase in the average volume of loans:
● Of the $8.4 million increase in interest income on a tax-equivalent basis, $5.2 million of the increase was due primarily to the increased volume of earning assets and $3.2 million of the increase was due to an increase in yields on average interest-earning assets.
● The yield on interest-earning assets increased 21 basis points to 5.18 percent in 2019 when compared to 2018.
● The average volume of interest-earning assets increased $105.3 million to $1.5 billion in 2019 compared to $1.4 billion in 2018. This was due primarily to a $105.4 million increase in average loans, primarily residential mortgage, commercial and consumer loans, and a $2.6 million increase in average federal funds, interest-bearing deposits and repos, partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in average investment securities.
Total interest expense was $18.1 million in 2019, an increase of $4.5 million or 33.6 percent compared to 2018. This increase was driven by the increased rates on interest-bearing deposits and volume of time deposits, partially offset by a decrease in the average volume of borrowed funds and subordinated debentures compared to a year ago:
● Of the $4.5 million increase in interest expense, $3.0 million was due to increased rates on interest-bearing liabilities and $1.6 million was due to an increase in the volume of average interest-bearing liabilities.
● The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 32 basis points to 1.64 percent in 2019 when compared to 2018. The cost of interest-bearing deposits and borrowed funds and subordinated debentures increased 36 basis points and 14 basis points, respectively, in 2019
● Interest-bearing liabilities averaged $1.1 billion in 2019, an increase of $72.1 million or 7.0 percent, compared to 2018. The increase in interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to an increase in average time deposits.
The following table reflects the components of net interest income, setting forth for the periods presented herein: (1) average assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity, (2) interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, (3) average yields earned on interest-earning assets and average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, (4) net interest spread, and (5) net interest income/margin on average earning assets. Rates/yields are computed on a fully tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 21 percent.
Consolidated Average Balance Sheets
(Dollar amounts in thousands, interest amounts and interest rates/yields on a fully tax-equivalent basis)
(A) Yields related to securities exempt from federal and state income taxes are stated on a fully tax-equivalent basis. They are reduced by the nondeductible portion of interest expense, assuming a federal tax rate of 21 percent in 2020, 2019 and 2018 and 35 percent in prior years and applicable state rates.
(B) The loan averages are stated net of unearned income, and the averages include loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued.
The rate volume table below presents an analysis of the impact on interest income and expense resulting from changes in average volume and rates over the periods presented. Changes that are not solely due to volume or rate variances have been allocated proportionally to both, based on their relative absolute values. Amounts have been computed on a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of 21 percent.
Provision for Loan Losses
The provision for loan losses totaled $7.0 million for 2020, $2.1 million in 2019 and $2.1 million in 2018. The increase in provision for loan losses in 2020 was primarily due to the increased risk of loan defaults as a result of COVID-19. The company may incur elevated provisions until restrictions on businesses have been loosened and they can fully open.
Each period’s loan loss provision is the result of management’s analysis of the loan portfolio and reflects changes in the size and composition of the portfolio, the level of net charge-offs, delinquencies, current economic conditions and other internal and external factors impacting the risk within the loan portfolio. Additional information may be found under the captions “Financial Condition - Asset Quality” and “Financial Condition - Allowance for Loan Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments.” The current provision is considered appropriate based upon management’s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.
Noninterest Income
The following table shows the components of noninterest income for the past three years:
2020 compared to 2019
Noninterest income was $12.9 million for 2020, a $3.4 million increase compared to $9.5 million for 2019. This increase was primarily due to increased gains on sales of mortgages.
Changes in noninterest income reflect:
● Branch fee income decreased $456 thousand to $1.0 million when compared to 2019, primarily due to a decrease in overdraft fees and transactions as a result of COVID-19.
● Service and loan fee income, which consists of prepayment fees, application fees and servicing fees, decreased $223 thousand in 2020, primarily due to lower loan late charges from waived fees for customers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
● Net gains on the sale of SBA loans increased $733 thousand in 2020 as a result of higher premiums on loan sales. In 2020, $18.2 million in SBA loans were sold compared to $14.9 million in the prior year.
● Gains on sales of mortgage loans increased $4.2 million in 2020 as a result of a volume increase. During the year, $290.8 million in residential mortgage loans were sold at a gain of $6.3 million compared to $120.2 million in loans sold at a gain of $2.1 million during the prior year.
● BOLI income increased $25 thousand from prior year.
● Gains on sales of securities totaled $322 thousand in 2020, compared to $52 thousand in 2019. In 2020, these gains were partially offset by $229 thousand from the decrease in the market value of equity securities, as compared to an increase of $321 thousand in 2019.
● There were no gains on sale of premises and equipment in 2020. The 2019 gain in premises and equipment was primarily due to the sale of our Union, NJ branch building.
● Other income increased $120 thousand, primarily due to an increase in wire transfer fee income.
2019 compared to 2018
Noninterest income was $9.5 million for 2019, a $508 thousand increase compared to $9.0 million for 2018. This increase was primarily due to market fluctuations on our equity securities and increased gains on sales of mortgages.
Changes in noninterest income reflect:
● Branch fee income decreased $17 thousand to $1.5 million when compared to 2018.
● Service and loan fee income, which consists of prepayment fees, applications fees and servicing fees, decreased $165 thousand in 2019.
● Net gains on the sale of SBA loans decreased $771 thousand to $909 thousand in 2019 due to a decrease in the volume of SBA loans sales. In 2019, $14.9 million in SBA loans were sold compared to $22.3 million in the prior year. The Company elected not to sell SBA loans during the third quarter of 2019.
● During 2019, $120.2 million in residential mortgage loans were sold at a gain of $2.1 million compared to $80.7 million in loans sold at a gain of $1.7 million during the prior year.
● BOLI income decreased $387 thousand from prior year, primarily due to a $291 thousand death benefit in the third quarter of 2018.
● Net security gains totaled $373 thousand in 2019 compared to losses of $199 thousand in 2018. Approximately $321 thousand of these gains resulted from an increase in the market value of equity securities, compared to a decrease of $195 thousand in 2018. Gains on sales of securities totaled $52 thousand in 2019, compared to losses of $4 thousand in 2018.
● Gain on sale of premises and equipment totaled $766 thousand in 2019 versus none in 2018. The increase was primarily due to the $768 thousand gain on the sale of our Union, NJ branch building in September 2019.
● Other income, which includes check card related income and miscellaneous service charges totaled $1.3 million and $1.2 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Noninterest Expense
The following table presents a breakdown of noninterest expense for the past three years:
2020 compared to 2019
Noninterest expense totaled $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $4.6 million when compared to $34.7 million in 2019. The majority of this increase is attributed to increased compensation due to mortgage commissions paid on a higher origination volume and expenses related to enhancing our BSA program and complying with our Consent Order with the FDIC and NJDOBI.
Changes in noninterest expense reflect:
● Compensation and benefits expense, the largest component of noninterest expense, increased $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to 2019. The yearly increase is primarily due to increased mortgage commissions on a higher origination volume.
● Processing and communications, which includes items processed and electronic banking fees, increased $231 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to 2019, primarily due to data processing expenses.
● Furniture and equipment expense, which includes network and software maintenance, decreased $288 thousand in 2020.
● Occupancy expense decreased $107 thousand in 2020 when compared to 2019.
● BSA expenses were $1.8 million in 2020 due to consulting expenses in connection with BSA/AML remediation related to the Bank’s Consent Order.
● Professional service fees increased $83 thousand in 2020, primarily due to higher external audit and tax expenses.
● Advertising expenses decreased $452 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, versus 2019 primarily due to decreased community relations expenses and marketing event related expenses due to the impact of COVID-19.
● Director fees increased $101 thousand in 2020 when compared to 2019.
● Other loan expenses, which consist of expenses such as appraisals, filings and credit reports, increased $350 thousand in 2020, when compared to 2019.
● Deposit insurance expense increased $373 thousand in 2020 when compared to 2019 primarily due to a $279 FDIC assessment credit in 2019.
● Loan collection and OREO expenses increased $174 thousand in 2020, primarily due to increased property tax expenses on OREO properties.
● Other expenses decreased $178 thousand in 2020 when compared to 2019, primarily due to lower officer and employee expenses.
2019 compared to 2018
Noninterest expense totaled $34.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $1.3 million when compared to $33.4 million in 2018. The majority of this increase is attributed to increased compensation and mortgage commissions paid on a higher origination volume and the continued investment in our technology infrastructure through software upgrades.
Changes in noninterest expense reflect:
● Compensation and benefits expense, the largest component of noninterest expense, increased $547 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to 2018. The yearly increase is primarily due to increased salary expenses and year-end bonuses paid to employees.
● Occupancy expense decreased $89 thousand in 2019 when compared to 2018.
● Processing and communications increased $136 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to 2018, primarily due to increased electronic banking expenses.
● Furniture and equipment expense increased $546 thousand in 2019, due to investment in software and equipment to remain efficient, secure and competitive technologically.
● Professional service fees increased $127 thousand in 2019, primarily due to higher consulting expenses.
● Loan collection and OREO expenses increased $402 thousand in 2019, primarily due to a $317 thousand settlement related to an OREO property in the third quarter of 2018.
● Other loan expenses, which consist of expenses such as appraisals, filings and credit reports, increased $64 thousand in 2019, when compared to 2018.
● Deposit insurance expense decreased $481 thousand in 2019 when compared to 2018 primarily due to an FDIC assessment credit of $279 thousand during the second half of 2019.
● Advertising expenses decreased $53 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, versus 2018.
● Director fees remained relatively flat in 2019 when compared to 2018.
● Other expenses increased $95 thousand in 2019, primarily due to higher officer and employee expenses.
Income Tax Expense
For 2020, the Company reported income tax expense of $7.5 million for an effective tax rate of 24.0%, compared to an income tax expense of $6.7 million and an effective tax rate of 22.0% in 2019 and an income tax expense of $5.4 million and an effective tax rate of 19.7% in 2018.
On July 1, 2018, New Jersey’s Assembly Bill 4202 was signed into law. The bill, effective January 1, 2018, imposed a temporary surtax on corporations earning New Jersey allocated income in excess of $1 million at a rate of 2.5% for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019, and at a rate of 1.5% for years beginning on or after January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2021. In addition, New Jersey adopted mandatory unitary combined reporting for its Corporation Business Tax, which became effective for periods on or after January 1, 2019.
On September 29, 2020, New Jersey’s Assembly Bill 4721 was signed into law. The bill, retroactively effective January 1, 2020, extends the 2.5% corporate income surtax until December 31, 2023. The Division of Taxation will waive any underpayment penalties on 2020 estimated tax payments related to the retroactive increase. In addition, if the federal corporate tax rate is increased to a rate of at least 35% of taxable income, the surtax will be suspended.
For additional information on income taxes, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Financial Condition
Total assets increased $240.0 million or 14.0%, to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $195.5 million in net loans, reflecting $118.3 million from the funding of PPP loans, strong commercial growth, and $61.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by a decrease of $19.0 million in investments.
Total deposits increased $307.8 million, primarily due to increases of $179.9 million in noninterest-bearing demand deposits, $48.5 million in savings deposits, $45.1 million in interest-bearing demand deposits, and $34.4 million in time deposits. Borrowed funds decreased $83.0 million to $200.0 million at December 31, 2020 due to a $63.0 million decrease in overnight borrowings and the maturity of a $20.0 million FHLB adjustable rate advance.
Total shareholders’ equity increased $13.2 million from year end 2019, primarily due to net income from operations, less dividends paid on our common stock. Net income was $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $9.0 thousand from the prior year. Other changes in shareholder’s equity included stock-based transactions of $1.6 million, offset by another comprehensive loss net of tax of $1.3 million, common stock dividends of $3.3 million paid in 2020 and treasury stock purchases of $7.4 million.
These fluctuations are discussed in further detail in the section that follow.
Securities
The Company’s securities portfolio consists of available for sale (“AFS”) debt securities and equity investments. The investment securities portfolio is maintained for asset-liability management purposes, as well as for liquidity and earnings purposes.
AFS debt securities are investments carried at fair value that may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions or for other business purposes. Activity in this portfolio is undertaken primarily to manage liquidity and interest rate risk, to take advantage of market conditions that create economically attractive returns and as an additional source of earnings. AFS debt securities consist primarily of obligations of U.S. Government sponsored entities, obligations of state and political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities, and corporate and other securities.
AFS debt securities totaled $45.6 million at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $18.7 million or 29.0 percent, compared to $64.3 million at December 31, 2019. This net decrease was the result of:
● $14.9 million in principal payments, maturities and called bonds,
● $6.6 million in sales net of realized gains, which consisted of two corporate bonds, three mortgage-backed securities, one tax-exempt municipal security, and one taxable municipal security,
● $695 thousand of depreciation in the market value of the portfolio. At December 31, 2020, the portfolio had a net unrealized loss of $304 thousand compared to a net unrealized gain of $392 thousand at
December 31, 2019. These net unrealized losses and gains are reflected net of tax in shareholders’ equity as accumulated other comprehensive income, and
● $241 thousand in net amortization, partially offset by
● An increase of $3.8 million from the purchase of two corporate bonds and three municipal tax-exempt securities.
The weighted average life of AFS debt securities, adjusted for prepayments, amounted to 4.6 years and 4.9 years at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Equity securities are investments carried at fair value that may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions or for other business purposes. Activity in this portfolio is undertaken primarily to manage liquidity and interest rate risk, to take advantage of market conditions that create economically attractive returns and as an additional source of earnings. Equity securities consist of Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA") investments and the equity holdings of financial institutions.
Equity securities totaled $2.0 million at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $335 thousand or 14.6 percent, compared to $2.3 million at December 31, 2019. This net decrease was the result of:
● $224 thousand in market value adjustments throughout the year, and
● $111 thousand in sales net of realized gains from the sale of one community bank holding.
The average balance of taxable securities amounted to $52.7 million in 2020 compared to $59.5 million in 2019. The average yield earned on taxable securities decreased 2 basis points to 3.22 percent in 2020, from 3.24 percent in 2019. The average balance of tax-exempt securities amounted to $3.1 million in 2020 compared to $4.4 million in 2019. The average yield earned on tax-exempt securities decreased 52 basis points to 2.42 percent in 2020, from 2.94 percent in 2019.
Securities with a carrying value of $1.6 million and $4.0 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, were pledged to secure other borrowings, collateralize hedging instruments and for other purposes required or permitted by law.
Approximately 48 percent of the total investment portfolio had a fixed rate of interest at December 31, 2020, compared to 64 percent in 2019.
For additional information on securities, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Loans
The loan portfolio, which represents the Company’s largest asset group, is a significant source of both interest and fee income. The portfolio consists of SBA, commercial, residential mortgage and consumer loans. Each of these segments is subject to differing levels of credit and interest rate risk.
Total loans increased $202.3 million or 14.2 percent to $1.6 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $1.4 billion at year-end 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the funding of SBA Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had PPP loans totaling $118.3 million. Commercial and consumer loans increased $74.8 million and $9.7 million respectively, partially offset by a decrease of $374 thousand and $120 thousand in SBA and residential loans.
The following table sets forth the classification of loans by major category, including unearned fees, deferred costs and excluding the allowance for loan losses at December 31st for the past five years:
Average loans increased $197.2 million or 14.6 percent from $1.3 billion in 2019, to $1.5 billion in 2020. The increase in average loans was due to increases in average PPP, commercial, residential mortgages, consumer and SBA loans. The yield on the overall loan portfolio decreased 41 basis points to 4.96 percent for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 5.37 percent for the prior year.
SBA 7(a) loans, on which the SBA historically has provided guarantees of up to 90 percent of the principal balance, are considered a higher risk loan product for the Company than its other loan products. These loans are made for the purposes of providing working capital, financing the purchase of equipment, inventory or commercial real estate. Generally, an SBA 7(a) loan has a deficiency in its credit profile that would not allow the borrower to qualify for a traditional commercial loan, which is why the SBA provides the guarantee. The deficiency may be a higher loan to value (“LTV”) ratio, lower debt service coverage (“DSC”) ratio or weak personal financial guarantees. In addition, many SBA 7(a) loans are for start up businesses where there is no historical financial information. Finally, many SBA borrowers do not have an ongoing and continuous banking relationship with the Bank, but merely work with the Bank on a single transaction. The guaranteed portion of the Company’s SBA loans is generally sold in the secondary market with the nonguaranteed portion held in the portfolio as a loan held for investment.
SBA 7(a) loans held for sale, carried at the lower of cost or market, amounted to $9.3 million at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $4.2 million from $13.5 million at December 31, 2019. SBA 7(a) loans held for investment amounted to $39.6 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $3.8 million from $35.8 million at December 31, 2019. The yield on SBA 7(a) loans, which is generally floating and adjusts quarterly to the Prime Rate, was 6.24 percent for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 7.76 percent in the prior year.
The guarantee rates on SBA 7(a) loans range from 50 percent to 90 percent, with the majority of the portfolio having a guarantee rate of 75 percent at origination. The guarantee rates are determined by the SBA and can vary from year to year depending on government funding and the goals of the SBA program. The carrying value of SBA loans held for sale represents the guaranteed portion to be sold into the secondary market. The carrying value of SBA loans held for investment represents the unguaranteed portion, which is the Company’s portion of SBA loans originated, reduced by the guaranteed portion that is sold into the secondary market. Approximately $98.9 million and $93.6 million in SBA loans were sold but serviced by the Company at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, and are not included on the Company’s balance sheet. There is no direct relationship or correlation between the guarantee percentages and the level of charge-offs and recoveries on the Company’s SBA 7(a) loans. Charge-offs taken on SBA 7(a) loans effect the unguaranteed portion of the loan. SBA loans are underwritten to the same credit standards irrespective of the guarantee percentage.
The CARES Act provides assistance to small businesses through the establishment of the PPP. The PPP generally provides eligible small businesses with funds to pay up to 24 weeks of payroll costs, including certain benefits. The funds are provided in the form of loans that may be fully or partially forgiven when used for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. The payments on these loans will be deferred for up to six months. Loans made after June 5, 2020, mature in five years, and loans made prior to June 5, 2020, mature in two years and can be extended to five years if the lender agrees. Forgiveness of the PPP loans is based on the employer maintaining or quickly rehiring employees and maintaining salary levels. Applications for the PPP loans started on April 3, 2020 and the application
period was extended through August 8, 2020. The Economic Aid Act provided additional funding for the PPP, and the application period was reopened. As an existing SBA 7(a) lender, the Company opted to participate in the program. Applications for PPP loans under the Economic Aid Act started on January 13, 2021 and are available until March 31, 2021.
Commercial loans are generally made in the Company’s marketplace for the purpose of providing working capital, financing the purchase of equipment, inventory or commercial real estate and for other business purposes. These loans amounted to $839.8 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $74.8 million from year end 2019. The yield on commercial loans was 5.06 percent for 2020, compared to 5.25 percent for the same period in 2019. The SBA 504 program, which consists of real estate backed commercial mortgages where the Company has the first mortgage and the SBA has the second mortgage on the property, is included in the Commercial loan portfolio. Generally, the Company has a 50 percent LTV ratio on SBA 504 program loans at origination.
Residential mortgage loans consist of loans secured by 1 to 4 family residential properties. These loans amounted to $467.6 million at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $120.0 thousand from year end 2019. Sales of mortgage loans totaled $290.8 million for 2020. Approximately $13.2 million of the loans sold were from portfolio, with the remainder consisting of new production. Approximately $29.7 million and $36.9 million in residential loans were sold but serviced by the Company at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, and are not included on the Company’s balance sheet. The yield on residential mortgages was 4.81 percent for 2020, compared to 5.01 percent for 2019. Residential mortgage loans maintained in portfolio are generally to individuals that do not qualify for conventional financing. In extending credit to this category of borrowers, the Bank considers other mitigating factors such as credit history, equity and liquid reserves of the borrower. As a result, the residential mortgage loan portfolio of the Bank includes fixed and adjustable rate mortgages with rates that exceed the rates on conventional fixed-rate mortgage loan products but are not considered high priced mortgages.
Consumer loans consist of home equity loans, construction loans and loans for the purpose of financing the purchase of consumer goods, home improvements, and other personal needs, and are generally secured by the personal property being purchased. These loans amounted to $153.3 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $9.7 million from December 31, 2019. The yield on consumer loans was 5.49 percent for 2020, compared to 6.34 percent for 2019.
There are no concentrations of loans to any borrowers or group of borrowers exceeding 10 percent of the total loan portfolio and no foreign loans in the portfolio.
In the normal course of business, the Company may originate loan products whose terms could give rise to additional credit risk. Interest-only loans, loans with high LTV ratios, construction loans with payments made from interest reserves and multiple loans supported by the same collateral (e.g. home equity loans) are examples of such products. However, these products are not material to the Company’s financial position and are closely managed via credit controls that mitigate their additional inherent risk. Management does not believe that these products create a concentration of credit risk in the Company’s loan portfolio. The Company does not have any option adjustable rate mortgage loans.
The majority of the Company’s loans are secured by real estate. Declines in the market values of real estate in the Company’s trade area impact the value of the collateral securing its loans. This could lead to greater losses in the event of defaults on loans secured by real estate. At December 31, 2020 approximately 87 percent of the Company’s loan portfolio was secured by real estate compared to 94 percent at December 31, 2019.
The following table shows the maturity distribution or repricing of the loan portfolio and the allocation of fixed and floating interest rates at December 31, 2020:
For additional information on loans, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Troubled Debt Restructurings
Troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) occur when a creditor, for economic or legal reasons related to a debtor’s financial condition, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider. These concessions typically include reductions in interest rate, extending the maturity of a loan, other modifications of payment terms, or a combination of modifications. Deferrals complying with the terms of the CARES Act and regulatory guidance (i.e., deferrals of up to six months to borrowers impacted by COVID-19 pandemic, where the borrower was current at either December 31, 2019 or prior to the deferral being granted) are not considered TDR’s.
When the Company modifies a loan, management evaluates the loan for any possible impairment using either the discounted cash flows method, where the value of the modified loan is based on the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at the contractual interest rate of the original loan agreement, or by using the fair value of the collateral less selling costs. If management determines that the value of the modified loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, impairment is recognized by segment or class of loan, as applicable, through an allowance estimate or charge-off to the allowance. This process is used, regardless of loan type, and for loans modified as TDRs that subsequently default on their modified terms.
At December 31, 2020, there was one loan totaling $663 thousand that was classified as a TDR and deemed impaired, compared to one such loan totaling $705 thousand at December 31, 2019. The TDR was a commercial real estate loan which was modified in 2017 to reduce the principal balance. The loan remains in accrual status since it continues to perform in accordance with the restructured terms. Restructured loans that are placed in nonaccrual status may be removed after six months of contractual payments and the borrower showing the ability to service the debt going forward.
For additional information on TDRs, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Asset Quality
Inherent in the lending function is credit risk, which is the possibility a borrower may not perform in accordance with the contractual terms of their loan. A borrower’s inability to pay their obligations according to the contractual terms can create the risk of past due loans and, ultimately, credit losses, especially on collateral deficient loans. The Company minimizes its credit risk by loan diversification and adhering to strict credit administration policies and procedures. Due diligence on loans begins when we initiate contact regarding a loan with a borrower. Documentation,
including a borrower’s credit history, materials establishing the value and liquidity of potential collateral, the purpose of the loan, the source of funds for repayment of the loan, and other factors, are analyzed before a loan is submitted for approval. The loan portfolio is then subject to on-going internal reviews for credit quality, as well as independent credit reviews by an outside firm.
The risk of loss is difficult to quantify and is subject to fluctuations in collateral values, general economic conditions and other factors. In some cases, these factors have also resulted in significant impairment to the value of loan collateral. The Company values its collateral through the use of appraisals, broker price opinions, and knowledge of its local market.
Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and OREO. Nonperforming loans consist of loans that are not accruing interest (nonaccrual loans) as a result of principal or interest being delinquent for a period of 90 days or more or when the ability to collect principal and interest according to the contractual terms is in doubt. When a loan is classified as nonaccrual, interest accruals discontinue and all past due interest previously recognized as income is reversed and charged against current period income. Generally, until the loan becomes current, any payments received from the borrower are applied to outstanding principal, until such time as management determines that the financial condition of the borrower and other factors merit recognition of a portion of such payments as interest income. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest are not included in nonperforming loans. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing generally represent loans that are well secured and in process of collection.
The following table sets forth information concerning nonperforming assets and loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest at December 31st for the past five years:
Nonperforming loans were $12.1 million at December 31, 2020, a $6.5 million increase from $5.6 million at year end 2019. Since year end 2019, nonperforming loans in the consumer, SBA, residential and commercial segments increased. The increase in nonperforming consumer loans was primarily due to three consumer construction loans totaling $1.7 million and four home equity loans totaling $1.3 million. Included in nonperforming loans at December 31, 2020 are approximately $371 thousand of loans guaranteed by the SBA, compared to $59 thousand at December 31, 2019. In addition, there were $449 thousand in loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest at December 31, 2020, compared to $930 thousand at December 31, 2019.
The Company did not have any OREO property at December 31, 2020, compared to $1.7 million at year end 2019. During 2020, the Company charged off $225 thousand on two OREO properties. The Company sold four properties, resulting in net recoveries of $68 thousand.
The Company also monitors potential problem loans. Potential problem loans are those loans where information about possible credit problems of borrowers causes management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with loan repayment terms. These loans are categorized by their non-passing risk rating and performing loan status. Potential problem loans totaled $36.7 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $29.3 million from $7.4 million at December 31, 2019.
For additional information on asset quality, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Allowance for Loan Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Loan Commitments
Management reviews the level of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis. The standardized methodology used to assess the adequacy of the allowance includes the allocation of specific and general reserves. Specific reserves are made to individual impaired loans, which have been defined to include all nonperforming loans and TDRs. The general reserve is set based upon a representative average historical net charge-off rate adjusted for certain environmental factors such as: delinquency and impairment trends, charge-off and recovery trends, volume and loan term trends, risk and underwriting policy trends, staffing and experience changes, national and local economic trends, industry conditions and credit concentration changes.
When calculating the five-year historical net charge-off rate, the Company weights the past three years more heavily as it believes they are more indicative of future charge-offs. All of the environmental factors are ranked and assigned a basis points value based on the following scale: low, low moderate, moderate, high moderate and high risk. The factors are evaluated separately for each type of loan. For example, commercial loans are broken down further into commercial and industrial loans, commercial mortgages, construction loans, etc. Each type of loan is risk weighted for each environmental factor based on its individual characteristics.
According to the Company’s policy, a loss (“charge-off”) is to be recognized and charged to the allowance for loan losses as soon as a loan is recognized as uncollectable. All credits which are 90 days past due must be analyzed for the Company’s ability to collect on the credit. Once a loss is known to exist, the charge-off approval process is immediately expedited.
The allowance for loan losses totaled $23.1 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $16.4 million at December 31, 2019, with resulting allowance to total loan ratios of 1.42 percent and 1.15 percent, respectively. Net charge-offs amounted to $290 thousand for 2020, compared to $1.2 million for 2019.
The following table is a summary of the changes to the allowance for loan losses for the past five years, including net charge-offs to average loan ratios for each major loan category:
The following table sets forth, for each of the major lending categories, the amount of the allowance for loan losses allocated to each category and the percentage of total loans represented by such category, as of December 31st of the past five years. The allocated allowance is the total of identified specific and general reserves by loan category. The allocation is not necessarily indicative of the categories in which future losses may occur. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio.
In addition to the allowance for loan losses, the Company maintains a reserve for unfunded loan commitments that is maintained at a level that management believes is adequate to absorb estimated probable losses. Adjustments to the reserve are made through other expense and applied to the reserve which is maintained in other liabilities. At December 31, 2020, a $288 thousand commitment reserve was reported on the balance sheet as an “other liability”, compared to a $273 thousand commitment reserve at December 31, 2019.
For additional information on the allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded loan commitments, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Deposits
Deposits, which include noninterest-bearing demand deposits, interest-bearing demand deposits, savings deposits and time deposits, are the primary source of the Company’s funds. The Company offers a variety of products designed to attract and retain customers, with primary focus on building and expanding relationships. The Company continues to focus on establishing a comprehensive relationship with business borrowers, seeking deposits as well as lending relationships.
The following table shows period-end deposits and the concentration of each category of deposits for the past three years:
2020 compared to 2019
Total deposits increased $307.8 million to $1.6 billion at December 31, 2020, from $1.3 billion at December 31, 2019. This increase in deposits was due to increases of $179.9 million in noninterest-bearing demand deposits, $48.5 million in savings deposits, $45.1 million in interest-bearing demand deposits, and $34.4 million in time deposits.
The Company’s deposit composition at December 31, 2020, consisted of 29.5 percent noninterest-bearing demand deposits, 29.2 percent savings deposits, 28.2 percent time deposits, and 13.1 percent interest-bearing demand deposits. The change in the composition of the portfolio from December 31, 2019 reflects a 7.1 percent increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and a 0.4 percent increase in interest-bearing demand deposits, offset by a 4.1 percent decrease in time deposits and a 3.4 percent decrease in savings deposits.
2019 compared to 2018
Total deposits increased $42.4 million to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2019, from $1.2 billion at December 31, 2018. This increase in deposits was due to increases of $47.2 million in time deposits, $9.6 million in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and $4.1 million in interest-bearing demand deposits, partially offset by a decrease of $18.4 million in savings deposits, respectively.
The Company’s deposit composition at December 31, 2019, consisted of 32.6 percent savings deposits, 32.3 percent time deposits, 22.4 percent noninterest-bearing demand deposits and 12.7 percent interest-bearing demand deposits. The change in the composition of the portfolio from December 31, 2018 reflects a 2.7 percent increase in time deposits, offset by a 1.4 percent decrease in savings deposits and a 1.3 percent decrease in interest-bearing demand deposits.
The following table shows average deposits and the concentration of each category of deposits for the past three years:
For additional information on deposits, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Borrowed Funds and Subordinated Debentures
Borrowed funds consist or previously consisted primarily of adjustable and fixed rate advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. These borrowings are used as a source of liquidity or to fund asset growth not supported by deposit generation. Residential mortgages and commercial loans collateralize the borrowings from the FHLB.
Borrowed funds and subordinated debentures totaled $210.3 million and $293.3 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, and are broken down in the following table:
Borrowed funds decreased $83.0 million from prior year-end due to a $63.0 million decrease in FHLB overnight borrowings and a $20.0 million decrease in FHLB adjustable rate advances during the year ended December 31, 2020.
FHLB Borrowings
At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had $40.0 million in fixed rate advances. The terms of this transaction are as follows:
● A $40.0 million FHLB borrowing with a maturity date of August 22, 2024, at a rate of 1.810%.
At December 31, 2020, the $30.0 million FHLB adjustable rate (“ARC”) advances consisted of one $20.0 million advance and one $10.0 million advance. At December 31, 2019, the $50.0 million FHLB ARC advances consisted of two $20.0 million advances and one $10.0 million advance. These ARC advances roll over every six months. The Company has opted to hedge rates in a fluctuating rate environment. Each ARC advance has a swap instrument which modifies the borrowing to a 5 year fixed rate borrowing. The terms of these transactions are as follows:
● A $20.0 million ARC FHLB borrowing with a maturity date of January 6, 2021, at a rate of 3 month LIBOR plus 0.165%. The swap instrument modifies the borrowing to a 5 year fixed rate borrowing at 1.212% and matures on July 5, 2021.
● A $10.0 million ARC FHLB borrowing with a maturity date of February 18, 2021, at a rate of 3 month LIBOR plus 0.130%. The swap instrument modifies the borrowing to a 5 year fixed rate borrowing at 1.232% that matures on February 16, 2021.
At December 31, 2020, there were FHLB overnight borrowings of $130.0 million at a rate of 0.340%, compared to $193.0 million at a rate of 1.810% at December 31, 2019.
In December 2020, the FHLB issued a $12.0 million municipal deposit letter of credit in the name of Unity Bank naming the NJ Department of Banking and Insurance as beneficiary, to secure municipal deposits as required under New Jersey law.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had $286.1 million of additional credit available at the FHLB. Pledging additional collateral in the form of 1 to 4 family residential mortgages, commercial loans and investment securities can increase the line with the FHLB.
Subordinated Debentures
On July 24, 2006, Unity (NJ) Statutory Trust II, a statutory business trust and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent Company, issued $10.0 million of floating rate capital trust pass through securities to investors due on July 24, 2036. The subordinated debentures are redeemable in whole or part, prior to maturity but after July 24, 2011. The floating interest rate on the subordinated debentures is three-month LIBOR plus 159 basis points and reprices quarterly. The floating interest rate was 1.835% at December 31, 2020 and 3.518% at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the subordinated debentures had a swap instrument which modified the borrowing to a 3 year fixed rate borrowing at 3.435%.
For additional information on borrowed funds and subordinated debentures, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Market Risk
Based on the Company’s business, the two largest risks facing the Company are market risk and credit risk. Market risk for the Company is primarily limited to interest rate risk, which is the impact that changes in interest rates would have on future earnings. The Company’s Risk Management Committee (“RMC”) manages this risk. The principal objectives of RMC are to establish prudent risk management guidelines, evaluate and control the level of interest rate risk in balance sheet accounts, determine the level of appropriate risk given the business focus, operating environment, capital, and liquidity requirements, and actively manage risk within Board-approved guidelines. The RMC reviews the maturities and repricing of loans, investments, deposits and borrowings, cash flow needs, current market conditions, and interest rate levels.
The Company uses various techniques to evaluate risk levels on both a short and long-term basis. One of the monitoring tools is the “gap” ratio. A gap ratio, as a percentage of assets, is calculated to determine the maturity and repricing mismatch between interest rate-sensitive assets and interest rate-sensitive liabilities. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate-sensitive assets repricing exceeds the amount of interest rate-sensitive liabilities repricing in a designated time period. A positive gap should result in higher net interest income with rising interest rates, as the amount of the assets repricing exceeds the amount of liabilities repricing. Conversely, a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate-sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate-sensitive assets, and lower rates should result in higher net interest income.
Repricing of mortgage-related securities is shown by contractual amortization and estimated prepayments based on the most recent 3-month constant prepayment rate. Callable agency securities are shown based upon their option-adjusted spread modified duration date (“OAS”), rather than the next call date or maturity date. The OAS date considers the coupon on the security, the time to the next call date, the maturity date, market volatility and current rate levels. Fixed rate loans are allocated based on expected amortization.
The following table sets forth the gap ratio at December 31, 2020. Assumptions regarding the repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities are critical in determining the projected level of rate sensitivity. Certain savings and interest checking accounts are less sensitive to market interest rate changes than other interest-bearing sources of funds. Core
deposits such as interest-bearing demand, savings and money market deposits are allocated based on their expected repricing in relation to changes in market interest rates.
At December 31, 2020, there was a six-month asset-sensitive gap of $51.5 million and a one-year asset-sensitive gap of $112.9 million, as compared to a six-month asset-sensitive gap of $4.6 million and a one-year asset-sensitive gap of $23.7 million at December 31, 2019. The six-month and one-year cumulative gap to total assets ratios were within the Board-approved guidelines of +/- 20 percent.
Other models are also used in conjunction with the static gap table, which is not able to capture the risk of changing spread relationships over time, the effects of projected growth in the balance sheet or dynamic decisions such as the modification of investment maturities as a rate environment unfolds. For these reasons, a simulation model is used, where numerous interest rate scenarios and balance sheets are combined to produce a range of potential income results. Net interest income is managed within guideline ranges for interest rates rising or falling by 200 basis points. Results outside of guidelines require action by the RMC to correct the imbalance. Simulations are typically created over a 12 to 24 month time horizon. At December 31, 2020, these simulations show that with a 200 basis point rate increase over a 12 month period, net interest income would decrease by approximately $1.1 million, or 1.6 percent. A 200 basis point rate decline over a 12 month period would increase net interest income by approximately $552 thousand or 0.8 percent. These variances in net interest income are within the Board-approved guidelines of +/- 10 percent.
Finally, to measure the impact of longer-term asset and liability mismatches beyond two years, the Company utilizes Modified Duration of Equity and Economic Value of Portfolio Equity (“EVPE”) models. The modified duration of
equity measures the potential price risk of equity to changes in interest rates. A longer modified duration of equity indicates a greater degree of risk to rising interest rates. Because of balance sheet optionality, an EVPE analysis is also used to dynamically model the present value of asset and liability cash flows, with rate shocks of 200 basis points. The economic value of equity is likely to be different as interest rates change. Results falling outside prescribed ranges require action by the RMC. The Company’s variance in the economic value of equity with rate shocks of 200 basis points is an increase of 4.1 percent in a rising rate environment and a decrease of 7.5 percent in a falling rate environment at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2019, the Company’s variance in the economic value of equity with rate shocks of 200 basis points is a decline of 1.8 percent in a rising rate environment and a decrease of 1.9 percent in a falling rate environment. The variance in the EVPE at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were within the Board-approved guidelines in place at the time of +/- 20 percent.
Liquidity
Consolidated Bank Liquidity
Liquidity measures the ability to satisfy current and future cash flow needs as they become due. A bank’s liquidity reflects its ability to meet loan demand, to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate opportunities in the marketplace. The Company’s liquidity is monitored by management and the Board of Directors which reviews historical funding requirements, the current liquidity position, sources and stability of funding, marketability of assets, options for attracting additional funds, and anticipated future funding needs, including the level of unfunded commitments. The goal is to maintain sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover potential funding requirements in order to minimize dependence on volatile and potentially unstable funding markets.
The principal sources of funds at the Bank are deposits, scheduled amortization and prepayments of investment and loan principal, sales and maturities of investment securities, additional borrowings and funds provided by operations. While scheduled loan payments and maturing investments are relatively predictable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows provides detail on the Company’s sources and uses of cash, as well as an indication of the Company’s ability to maintain an adequate level of liquidity. As the Consolidated Bank comprises the majority of the assets of the Company, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows is indicative of the Consolidated Bank’s activity. At December 31, 2020, the balance of cash and cash equivalents was $219.3 million, an increase of $61.3 million from December 31, 2019. A discussion of the cash provided by and used in operating, investing and financing activities follows.
Operating activities provided $33.7 million and $33.2 million in net cash for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The primary sources of funds were net income from operations and adjustments to net income, such as the proceeds from the sale of mortgage and SBA loans held for sale, partially offset by originations of mortgage and SBA loans held for sale.
Investing activities used $186.8 million and $133.1 million in net cash for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash was primarily used to fund new loans, primarily PPP loans, and purchase FHLB stock, partially offset by cash inflows from proceeds from the redemption of FHLB stock.
● Securities. The Consolidated Bank’s available for sale investment portfolio amounted to $45.6 million and $64.3 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. This excludes the Parent Company’s securities discussed under the heading “Parent Company Liquidity” below. Projected cash flows from securities over the next twelve months are $13.3 million.
● Loans. The SBA loans held for sale portfolio amounted to $9.3 million and $13.5 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Sales of these loans provide an additional source of liquidity for the Company.
● Outstanding Commitments. The Company was committed to advance approximately $288.4 million to its borrowers as of December 31, 2020, compared to $272.8 million at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020, $114.2 million of these commitments expire within one year, compared to $119.2 million at December 31, 2019. The Company had $4.5 million and $4.8 million in standby letters of credit at
December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, which are included in the commitments amount noted above. The estimated fair value of these guarantees is not significant. The Company believes it has the necessary liquidity to honor all commitments. Many of these commitments will expire and never be funded.
Financing activities provided $214.3 million and $112.4 million in net cash for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, primarily due to an increase in the Company’s deposits and borrowings, partially offset by the Company’s repayment of borrowings.
● Deposits. As of December 31, 2020, deposits included $142.6 million of Government deposits, as compared to $123.3 million at year end 2019. These deposits are generally short in duration and are very sensitive to price competition. The Company believes that the current level of these types of deposits is appropriate. Included in the portfolio were $127.6 million of deposits from eleven municipalities with account balances in excess of $5.0 million. The withdrawal of these deposits, in whole or in part, would not create a liquidity shortfall for the Company.
● Borrowed Funds. Total FHLB borrowings amounted to $200.0 million and $283.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, the Company can borrow additional funds based on the market value of collateral pledged. At December 31, 2020, pledging provided an additional $286.1 million in borrowing potential from the FHLB. In addition, the Company can pledge additional collateral in the form of 1 to 4 family residential mortgages, commercial loans or investment securities to increase this line with the FHLB.
Parent Company Liquidity
The Parent Company’s cash needs are funded by dividends paid and rental payments on corporate headquarters by the Bank. Other than its investment in the Bank, Unity Risk Management Inc., and Unity Statutory Trust II, the Parent Company does not actively engage in other transactions or business. Only expenses specifically for the benefit of the Parent Company are paid using its cash, which typically includes the payment of operating expenses, cash dividends on common stock and payments on trust preferred debt.
At December 31, 2020, the Parent Company had $640 thousand in cash and cash equivalents and $1.0 million in investment securities valued at fair market value, compared to $2.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1.4 million in investment securities at December 31, 2019.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations
The following table shows the amounts and expected maturities or payment periods of off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:
Standby letters of credit represent guarantees of payment issued by the Bank on behalf of a client that is used as "payment of last resort" should the client fail to fulfill a contractual commitment with a third party. Standby letters of credit are typically short-term in duration, maturing in one year or less.
Time deposits have stated maturity dates. For additional information on time deposits, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Borrowed funds and subordinated debentures include adjustable rate borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank and subordinated debentures. The borrowings have defined terms and under certain circumstances are callable at the option of the lender. For additional information on borrowed funds and subordinated debentures, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Purchase obligations represent legally binding and enforceable agreements to purchase goods and services from third parties and consist primarily of contractual obligations under data processing and ATM service agreements.
Capital Adequacy
A significant measure of the strength of a financial institution is its capital base. Shareholders’ equity increased $13.2 million to $173.9 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $160.7 million at December 31, 2019, primarily due to net income of $23.6 million. Other items impacting shareholders’ equity included $7.4 million in treasury stock purchased at cost, $3.3 million in dividends paid on common stock, $1.6 million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans and $1.3 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax. The issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans includes nonqualified stock options and restricted stock expense related entries, employee option exercises and the tax benefit of options exercised.
For additional information on shareholders’ equity, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
On September 17, 2019, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule providing simplified capital requirements for certain community banking organizations (banks and holding companies) with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, implementing provisions of The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (“EGRRCPA”). Under the rule, a qualifying community banking organization would be eligible to elect the community bank leverage ratio framework, or continue to measure capital under the existing Basel III requirements. The new rule, effective beginning January 1, 2020, allowed qualifying community banking organizations (“QCBO”) to opt into the new community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”) in their call report beginning in the first quarter of 2020.
A QCBO is defined as a bank, a savings association, a bank holding company or a savings and loan holding company with:
● A leverage capital ratio of greater than 9.0%;
● Total consolidated assets of less than $10.0 billion;
● Total off-balance sheet exposures (excluding derivatives other than credit derivatives and unconditionally cancelable commitments) of 25% or less of total consolidated assets; and
● Total trading assets and trading liabilities of 5% or less of total consolidated assets.
On April 6, 2020, the federal banking regulators, implementing the applicable provisions of the CARES Act, modified the CBLR framework so that: (i) beginning in the second quarter 2020 and until the end of the year, a banking organization that has a leverage ratio of 8% or greater and meets certain other criteria may elect to use the CBLR framework; and (ii) community banking organizations will have until January 1, 2022, before the CBLR requirement is re-established at greater than 9%. Under the interim rules, the minimum CBLR will be 8% beginning in the second quarter and for the remainder of calendar year 2020, 8.5% for calendar year 2021, and 9% thereafter. The numerator of the CBLR is Tier 1 capital, as calculated under present rules. The denominator of the CBLR is the QCBO’s average assets, calculated in accordance with the QCBO’s Call Report instructions less assets deducted from Tier 1 capital.
The Bank has opted into the CBLR and is therefore not be required to comply with the Basel III capital requirements. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank’s CBLR was 9.80% and the Company’s CBLR was 10.09%.
For additional information on regulatory capital, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Forward-Looking Statements
This report contains certain forward-looking statements, either expressed or implied, which are provided to assist the reader in understanding anticipated future financial performance. These statements involve certain risks, uncertainties, estimates and assumptions by management.
Factors that may cause actual results to differ from those results expressed or implied, include, but are not limited to those listed under “Item 1A - Risk Factors” in this Annual Report; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall economy and the interest rate environment; the ability of customers to repay their obligations; the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses; competition; significant changes in tax, accounting or regulatory practices and requirements; and technological changes. Although management has taken certain steps to mitigate the negative effect of the aforementioned items, significant unfavorable changes could severely impact the assumptions used and have an adverse effect on future profitability.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” is based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Note 1 to the Company’s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, contains a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies. Management believes the Company’s policies with respect to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses, valuation of deferred tax and servicing assets, the carrying value of loans held for sale and other real estate owned, the valuation of securities and the determination of other-than-temporary impairment for securities and fair value disclosures involve a higher degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments, which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. Changes in these judgments, assumptions or estimates could materially impact results of operations. These critical policies are periodically reviewed with the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment
The Company has a process in place to identify debt securities that could potentially incur credit impairment that is other-than-temporary. This process involves monitoring late payments, pricing levels, downgrades by rating agencies, key financial ratios, financial statements, revenue forecasts and cash flow projections as indicators of credit issues. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concern warrants such evaluation. This evaluation considers relevant facts and circumstances in evaluating whether a credit or interest rate-related impairment of a security is other-than-temporary. Relevant facts
and circumstances considered include: (1) the extent and length of time the fair value has been below cost; (2) the reasons for the decline in value; (3) the financial position and access to capital of the issuer, including the current and future impact of any specific events and (4) for fixed maturity securities, the intent to sell a security or whether it is more likely than not the security will be required to be sold before the recovery of its amortized cost which, in some cases, may extend to maturity and for equity securities, the ability and intent to hold the security for a forecasted period of time that allows for the recovery in value.
Management assesses its intent to sell or whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit losses. For debt securities that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired with no intent to sell and no requirement to sell prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amount of the impairment is separated into the amount that is credit related (credit loss component) and the amount due to all other factors. The credit loss component is recognized in earnings and is the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows. The remaining difference between the security’s fair value and the present value of future expected cash flows is due to factors that are not credit related and is recognized in other comprehensive income. For debt securities where management has the intent to sell, the amount of the impairment is reflected in earnings as realized losses.
The present value of expected future cash flows is determined using the best estimate cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate implicit to the security at the date of purchase or the current yield to accrete an asset-backed or floating rate security. The methodology and assumptions for establishing the best estimate cash flows vary depending on the type of security. The asset-backed securities cash flow estimates are based on bond specific facts and circumstances that may include collateral characteristics, expectations of delinquency and default rates, loss severity and prepayment speeds and structural support, including subordination and guarantees. The corporate bond cash flow estimates are derived from scenario-based outcomes of expected corporate restructurings or the disposition of assets using bond specific facts and circumstances including timing, security interests and loss severity.
For additional information on other-than-temporary impairment, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Servicing Assets
Servicing assets represent the estimated fair value of retained servicing rights, net of servicing costs, at the time loans are sold. Servicing assets are amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing revenues. Impairment is evaluated based on stratifying the underlying financial assets by date of origination and term. Fair value is determined using prices for similar assets with similar characteristics, when available, or based upon discounted cash flows using market-based assumptions. Any impairment, if temporary, would be reported as a valuation allowance.
For additional information on servicing assets, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Allowance for Loan Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments
The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level management considers adequate to provide for probable loan losses as of the balance sheet date. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and is reduced by net charge-offs.
The level of the allowance is based on management’s evaluation of probable losses in the loan portfolio, after consideration of prevailing economic conditions in the Company’s market area, the volume and composition of the loan portfolio, and historical loan loss experience. The allowance for loan losses consists of specific reserves for individually impaired credits and TDRs and reserves for nonimpaired loans based on historical loss factors and reserves based on general economic factors and other qualitative risk factors such as changes in delinquency trends, industry concentrations or local/national economic trends. This risk assessment process is performed at least quarterly, and, as adjustments become necessary, they are realized in the periods in which they become known.
Although management attempts to maintain the allowance at a level deemed adequate to provide for probable losses, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based upon certain factors including changes in market conditions and underlying collateral values. In addition, various regulatory agencies periodically review the adequacy of the
Company’s allowance for loan losses. These agencies may require the Company to make additional provisions based on judgments about information available at the time of the examination.
The Company maintains an allowance for unfunded loan commitments that is maintained at a level that management believes is adequate to absorb estimated probable losses. Adjustments to the allowance are made through other expenses and applied to the allowance which is maintained in other liabilities.
For additional information on the allowance for loan losses and unfunded loan commitments, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes according to the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates applicable to taxable income for the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. If tax reform results in a decline in the corporate tax rates the Company would have to write-down its deferred tax asset.
Valuation reserves are established against certain deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Increases or decreases in the valuation reserve are charged or credited to the income tax provision.
When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that ultimately would be sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. The evaluation of a tax position taken is considered by itself and not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits would be recognized in income tax expense on the income statement.
For additional information on income taxes, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
