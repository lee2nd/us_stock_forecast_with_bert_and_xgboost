Recent Highlights of Evolutionary Genomics
·
During 2013, Evolutionary Genomics received results from our contracted independent lab at UW confirming that Evolutionary Genomics’ gene, EG261, has a significant impact on resistance to soybean cyst nematodes.
·
During 2019, we identified our FusR1 gene in bananas for disease resistance and filed a patent application.
·
During 2020, WCIC completed a project for the Company to transform soybean plants using our EG261 and EG19 genes and to develop resulting plants through generation T2 seeds.
·
During 2020, we entered into the DCA with Dole and a Research Agreement with WCIC for the development of the FusR1 gene and banana plants that are resistant to Panama Disease.
Consolidated Results of Operations:
Grant Revenue
Grant revenue decreased $110,186, or 89.8%, to $12,500 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $122,686 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in revenue received from the State of Colorado grant which was completed in the first quarter of 2020.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses increased $1,741,792, or 194.1%, to $2,639,303 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $897,511 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Operating expenses consist of research and development expense, salaries and benefits and general and administrative expense. Changes in these items are described below.
Research and Development
Research and development increased $1,320,532, or 279.4%, to $1,793,145 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $472,613 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to increased costs incurred on our research agreement with UW for the development of our FusR1 banana gene. Under the terms of our Development and Commercialization Agreement with Dole Food Company, Dole provides funding for our banana project expenses at the University of Wisconsin in the form of notes payable.
Salaries and Benefits
Salaries and benefits increased $289,690, or 140.7%, to $495,518 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $205,828 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to bonuses paid in the year ended December 31, 2020 and increased stock compensation costs.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses increased $384,562, or 175.5%, to $603,632 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $219,070 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to amortization of our intangible asset which began in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Other Income and (Expenses)
Total other income and (expenses) increased $166,967, or 1228.4%, to $180,559 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $13,592 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to increases in the value of our investments and forgiveness of our Small Business Administration Payroll Protection Program loan (“PPP”).
Income Taxes
Income tax benefit increased $1,019,260 to $987,353 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from income tax expense of $31,907 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was the result of placing the in progress research and development into service and the asset now having a finite life.
Net Loss
Net loss increased $918,743, or 115.8%, to $1,711,883 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $793,140 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to increased costs incurred on our research agreement with the University of Wisconsin for the development of our FusR1 banana gene, increased costs for the amortization of our intangible asset and increased bonuses and stock compensation costs partially offset by the income tax benefit, PPP loan forgiveness and gains on investments.
Financial Condition
The Company’s working capital increased $175,681 to $274,429 as of December 31, 2020 from $98,748 as of December 31, 2019 primarily due to proceeds from notes payable from Dole, PPP loan and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (“EIDL”) and sale of our investments partially offset by the net loss from operations, increases in prepaid expenses and decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company has historically financed operations through cash flows from operations and equity transactions. Net cash used in operating activities was $2,297,317 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $625,980 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $1,597,069, or 255.1%, increase was primarily due to the increased net operating loss. Net cash provided from the sale of investments was $147,613 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net cash provided from financing activities was $2,245,831 from notes payable from Dole, PPP loan and EIDL in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $540,015 from preferred stock issuances for the year ended December 31, 2019.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $215,836 in bank accounts and during 2020 used $2,297,317 of cash in operations. The Company’s current projections for 2021 requires cash of $1,351,436. These factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
To address these factors, management believes that it will secure additional funding to meet prospective cash requirements. Management believes the Company’s existing cash balances along with funding from our agreement with Dole, prospective funding from marketing additional genes, and additional contributions from our largest shareholder will provide the necessary liquidity to meet our obligations as they come due over the next year. We expect that the funding from these sources will be more than enough to cover our obligations for the next twelve months. However, if the funding does not arrive, the Company may not be able to meet its obligations as they become due.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect, or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect, on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.
Contractual Obligations
The Company leases its operating facility on a month-to-month basis, with monthly rental installments of $2,378. The Company’s rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $28,535.
