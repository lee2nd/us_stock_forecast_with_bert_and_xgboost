Results of Operation
We completed a stock exchange on May 19, 2008 and changed our business model. We have not generated any revenue since inception and do not have any cash generating product or licensing sales. We have incurred losses since Inception (March 15, 1994).
We had a net loss of $81,529 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to a net loss of $68,302 in 2019. Professional fees were $43,598 in 2020, as compared to $28,014 in 2019, an increase of $15,584. An increase in our auditing fees is responsible for the increase in professional fees. Compensation was $7,839 in 2020, as compared to $4,916 in 2019, an increase of $2,923 which increased our net loss.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we used $33,026 of cash in operating activities and $0 cash in investing activities. We received $22,600 of cash from the sale of shares of our common stock. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized an $5,893 net decrease in
cash on hand. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we used $56,244 of cash in operating activities and $-0- of cash in investing activities, and received net cash of $69,002 provided by financing activities, resulting in a $11,342 decrease in cash on hand for the year.
At December 31, 2020, we had current assets of $348 and current liabilities of $276,955 as compared to current assets of $6,241 and current liabilities of $238,622 at December 31, 2019. Our decrease in current assets resulted from a decreased amount of financing activities in 2020 as compared to 2019.
Because of our history of losses, net capital deficit and lack of assurance of additional financing, the audit report on our financial statements contains a “going concern” opinion regarding doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
In an attempt to address our financing needs, we have made sales of our common stock in private transactions.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we entered into Stock Purchase Agreements for the private sale to four persons or entities of an aggregate of 2,166,667 shares of the common stock for aggregate proceeds of $22,600. All of the proceeds were paid during the 12 months ended December 31, 2020.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we entered into Stock Purchase Agreements for the private sale to six persons or entities of an aggregate of 11,200,000 shares of the common stock for aggregate proceeds of $69,002. All of the proceeds were paid during the 12 months ended December 31, 2019.
On March 16, 2015 we entered into a letter agreement with Adapt IP Ventures, LLC (Adapt IP) confirming the retention of Adapt IP to assist us in identifying companies that might be interested in acquiring and / or licensing our patents, to attempt to negotiate financial terms and conditions for acquisition and / or licensing and to assist with collection of compensation from such entities. Adapt IP will receive a success fee of 15% of net compensation received from such entities based upon Adapt IP’s efforts. We or Adapt IP may terminate the agreement upon 30 days’ notice to the other party.
On April 20, 2015 we made a Promissory Note to Adapt IP for $20,000, and Adapt IP agreed to pay to our patent counsel up to $20,000 for patent work on our behalf. The Note matures one year from the date of the Note. We are obligated to repay the funds advanced by Adapt IP plus a premium of 10% of the principal amount and a percentage of proceeds received by us from any monetization event involving the patents. If we repay the Note within the six months of the date of the Note, the percentage will be 1%, and it will be 2% after six months. As of December 31, 2020 $11,961 interest has accrued.
On August 20, 2015, AVRS entered into a letter agreement with Dominion Harbor Group, LLC pursuant to which Dominion will provide strategic advisory services to AVRS to support the common goal of the acquisition, sale, licensing, prosecution, enforcement, and settlement with respect to AVRS’s intellectual property, including patents held by AVRS. On June 28, 2017 AVRS and Dominion agreed to terminate the August 20, 2015 Letter Agreement. AVRS did not incur any material early termination penalties in connection of the early termination of the agreement.
On November 1, 2016, AVRS entered into a Contingent Fee Agreement with Buether Joe and Carpenter, LLC to represent AVRS in connection with investigating and asserting claims including negotiating license agreements and the filing and prosecution of lawsuits against any potential infringers of the Patent rights.

Historically, our President has loaned or advanced to us funds for working capital on an “as needed” basis. There is no assurance that these loans or advances will continue in the future. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we owed our officers an aggregate of $162,382 for accrued payroll. On September 24, 2018, the Company entered into a Promissory Note with Walter Geldenhuys, who is our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and who serves as a member of our Board of Directors. The Promissory Note is effective as of September 24, 2018 in the principal amount of $9,000 with a maturity date of September 24, 2019. Interest at 4% per annum was charged and $91.00 accrued at December 31, 2018. On December 10, 2018 the Company repaid $2,500 leaving a balance of $6,500. During 2019 the Company repaid $6,500, paying the note in full on December 27, 2019. Our Secretary / Treasurer advanced the Company a total of $4533 at December 31, 2020.
Because of our history of losses, and lack of assurance of additional financing, the audit reports on our financial statements at December 31, 2020 and 2019 contained a “going concern” opinion regarding doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
We will require additional debt or equity financing or a combination of both in order to carry out our business plan. We plan to raise additional funds through future sales of our securities, until such time as our revenues are sufficient to meet our cost structure, and ultimately achieve profitable operations. There is no assurance we will be successful in raising additional capital or achieving profitable operations. Our board of directors may attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations that may consist of restricted shares of our common stock. These actions would result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders and may further dilute our common stock book value.
To obtain sufficient funds to meet our future needs for capital, we will from time to time, evaluate opportunities to raise financing through some combination of the private sale of equity, or issuance of convertible debt securities. However, future equity or debt financing may not be available to us at all, or if available, may not be on terms acceptable to us. We do not intend to pay dividends to shareholders in the foreseeable future.
