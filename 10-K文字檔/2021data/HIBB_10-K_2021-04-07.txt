Key Events and Recent Developments
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic, which is still ongoing today. The effects from the pandemic included mass closings of parts of the economy nationally and globally, supply chain disruptions and stay-at-home orders which impacted every aspect of our business. Throughout this challenging time, we were able to navigate a rapidly changing retail landscape by leveraging omni-channel and distribution capabilities, having access to and availability of in-demand products, taking decisive action to protect liquidity at the beginning of the pandemic, demonstrating the ability to reopen stores quickly when circumstances allowed and servicing our customers quickly and safely through new shopping and payment initiatives.
In addition to the challenging business environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a renewed focus on important social issues. Even as these events continue on personal and professional levels, we are taking action to be part of the solution in our neighborhoods which includes:
•Continuing to be proactive in protecting the health and safety of our team members and customers and requiring all store locations, our store support center and logistics facility to follow prescribed safety guidelines. For more information, please visit www.hibbett.com/shop-safely-in-stores.html; and
•Recognizing the challenges facing our society related to important social issues. The Sole School initiative has been launched and over 80 high schools will be involved. The program includes product and monetary donations and is closely linked to high school athletics. Given the current COVID-19 environment, we have partnered with these selected schools to develop a virtual engagement plan that protects the safety of the communities which began in November 2020. A full rollout of the program is expected in Fiscal 2022 to align with the spring sports season.

In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic developments noted above, other key events impacted our operations and financial results in Fiscal 2021. Included in those events were:
•The opening of 16 new stores;
•The closure of 42 stores, mainly as a result of under-performance and rebranding;
•The rebranding of 12 Hibbett stores to City Gear stores;
•The continued integration of City Gear processes, including internal controls; and
•Ongoing investments in our omni-channel business.

As of January 30, 2021, we operated a total of 1,067 retail stores in 35 states composed of 882 Hibbett Sports stores, 167 City Gear stores and 18 Sports Additions athletic shoe stores.
Our Hibbett Sports stores average 5,800 square feet and are located primarily in strip centers, which are usually near a major chain retailer. Our City Gear stores average 5,000 square feet and are located primarily in strip centers. Our store base consisted of 793 stores located in strip centers, 31 free-standing stores and 243 enclosed mall locations as of January 30, 2021.
Hibbett operates on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest to January 31 of each year. The consolidated statements of operations for Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019 all included 52 weeks of operations. Fiscal 2022 will also include 52 weeks of operations.
Executive Summary
Following is a highlight of our financial results over the last three fiscal years:
During Fiscal 2021, we opened 28 stores and closed 42 stores, bringing the store base to 1,067 in 35 states as of January 30, 2021. Included in new stores are 12 Hibbett stores rebranded and opened as City Gear stores. Included in closed stores are ten Hibbett stores closed for rebranding to City Gear stores. During Fiscal 2020, we opened 24 stores (which included 11 Hibbett stores rebranded and opened as City Gear stores) and closed 106 stores (which included 9 Hibbett stores closed for rebranding to City Gear stores). Inventory on a per store basis decreased 29.9% compared to the prior fiscal year as a result of unprecedented demand coupled with supply chain constraints.
Hibbett ended Fiscal 2021 with $209.3 million of available cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet. Hibbett had no debt outstanding at January 30, 2021, and had full availability of $75.0 million available under the Amended Credit Facility. In March 2020, we borrowed $50.0 million under our prior credit facilities as a precautionary measure in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of the uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The proceeds from such borrowings could be used for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. On April 16, 2020, we entered into the Amended Credit Facility that provided for an aggregate amount of credit available to us of $75.0 million. The Amended Credit Facility superseded the Regions Bank credit agreement dated October 2018, terminated the Bank of America credit agreement dated October 2018, matures on July 18, 2021 and is secured by all assets of the Company with the exception of real property. For discussion of our Amended Credit Facility and other borrowings, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources."
Index
For Fiscal 2021, total company-wide square footage decreased 1.3%. To supplement new store openings, we continued to expand high performing stores, increasing the square footage in 7 existing stores in Fiscal 2021 for an average increase in square footage of 55.1%.
In Fiscal 2021, comparable store sales increased 22.2%.
Comparable store sales - Stores deemed as comparable stores include our Hibbett Sports, City Gear and Sports Additions stores open throughout the period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, and e-commerce sales. We consider comparable store sales to be a key indicator of our current performance; measuring the growth in sales and sales productivity of existing stores. Management believes that positive comparable store sales contribute to greater leveraging of operating costs, particularly payroll and occupancy costs, while negative comparable store sales contribute to deleveraging of costs. Comparable store sales also have a direct impact on our total net sales and the level of cash flow. Comparable store sales for City Gear stores are presented in comparable store sales beginning in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020 and is in full year comparable store sales for Fiscal 2021.
For Fiscal 2021, 1,015 stores were included in comparable sales. If a store remodel, relocation, or expansion results in the store being closed for a significant period, its sales are removed from the comparable store sales base until it has been open a full 12 months. In addition, rebranded stores are treated as a new store and are not presented in comparable store sales until they have been open a full 12 months under the new brand.
About Non-GAAP Measures
This MD&A includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors to facilitate comparisons of our current financial results to historical operations and the financial results of peer companies, as they exclude the effects of items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, our underlying operating results, such as expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic in Fiscal 2021, the acquisition and integration of City Gear in both Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, and our strategic realignment plan in Fiscal 2020. Costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic include impairment charges of goodwill, tradename and other assets and net lower of cost or net realizable value (LCM) inventory reserve charges and were specific to Fiscal 2021. Costs related to acquisition and integration of City Gear include amortization of inventory step-up value, professional service fees and changes in the valuation of the contingent earnout. Costs related to the strategic realignment plan included lease and equipment impairment costs, third party liquidation fees, store exit costs, and residual net lease costs.
While we use these non-GAAP financial measures as a tool to enhance our ability to assess certain aspects of our financial performance, our management does not consider these measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial statements. Consistent with this approach, we believe that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures to the readers of our financial statements provides such readers with useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP financial statements, allows for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

Results of Operations
The following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items included in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated.
Note: Columns may not sum due to rounding.
Fiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020
Net sales. Net sales increased $235.4 million, or 19.9% to $1.42 billion for Fiscal 2021 from $1.18 billion for Fiscal 2020. Furthermore:
•Comparable store net sales for Fiscal 2021 increased 22.2% compared to Fiscal 2020 primarily driven by strength in men's, women's and kids' footwear coupled with increased volume in sneaker-connected apparel and accessories. These strengths were partially offset by softer sales in team sports. For Fiscal 2021, 1,015 stores were included in the comparable store sales comparison.
•Stores not in the comparable store net sales calculation accounted for $244.9 million of net sales.
•E-commerce sales increased 92.1% compared to Fiscal 2020.
•Increases were noted in both average ticket and items per transaction.
•We decreased our overall store count by a net of 14 stores in Fiscal 2021 primarily as the result of accelerated closure of underperforming stores in the fourth quarter.
Gross margin. Cost of goods sold includes the cost of merchandise, occupancy costs for stores, occupancy and operating costs for our wholesale and logistics facility and ship-to-home freight. Gross margin was $504.5 million, or 35.5% of net sales, in Fiscal 2021, compared with $383.5 million, or 32.4% of net sales, in Fiscal 2020. Excluding inventory reserve adjustments in the current year and City Gear acquisition and strategic realignment costs incurred in the prior year, non-GAAP gross margin was $507.5 million, or 35.8% of net sales in Fiscal 2021, compared to $383.3 million, or 32.4% in Fiscal 2020.
Overall, GAAP gross margin improved by approximately 310 basis points as a percentage of net sales in comparison to the prior year driven by higher sell through and leverage of store occupancy expenses. These impacts were slightly offset by a higher mix of e-commerce sales, which carry a lower margin due to incremental shipping costs, and an increase in the LCM inventory reserve. Logistics expenses were higher year over year in dollars, but decreased slightly as a percentage of net sales. The uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on inventory valuations contributed to a large increase in the LCM inventory reserve in the first quarter. Although aged inventory and the related reserve declined over the fiscal year, there was still a net $3.0 million LCM expense impact in Fiscal 2021. This amount was excluded from the non-GAAP gross margin figure. Store occupancy costs decreased approximately 160 basis points as a percentage of net sales year over year due to leverage generated from increased sales revenue.
Store operating, selling and administrative (SG&A) expenses. SG&A expenses, including goodwill impairment, were $376.5 million, or 26.5% of net sales, for Fiscal 2021, compared with $318.0 million, or 26.9% of net sales, for Fiscal 2020.
Excluding non-GAAP adjustments, SG&A expenses were $336.5 million, or 23.7% of net sales for Fiscal 2021, compared to $298.5 million, or 25.2% of net sales, for Fiscal 2020.
Index
A large portion of the SG&A increase resulted from impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This included non-cash intangible asset impairments to goodwill in the amount of $19.7 million and the City Gear tradename of $8.9 million. Other impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic included asset group impairments of approximately $4.1 million and other related costs of $2.8 million.
Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased 40 basis points as a percentage of net sales for Fiscal 2021 compared to Fiscal 2020. This decrease was mainly due to leverage from higher net sales.
Provision for income taxes. The combined federal, state and local effective income tax rate as a percentage of pre-tax income was 24.2% for Fiscal 2021 and 24.7% for Fiscal 2020. The lower rate in the current year was the result of executive compensation deduction limitations in the prior year and additional equity compensation deductions in Fiscal 2021 resulting from the Company's increased stock price.
Reconciliations of Non-GAAP financial measures. The following table provides a reconciliations of our consolidated statement of operations for the fifty-two weeks ended January 30, 2021, as reported on a GAAP basis, to a statement of operations for the same period prepared on a non-GAAP basis.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation
(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)
1) Excluded acquisition amounts during the 52-week period ended January 30, 2021, related to the acquisition of City Gear, LLC, consist primarily of change in the valuation of contingent earnout and accounting and professional fees.
2) Excluded amounts during the 52-week period ended January 30, 2021, related to the COVID-19 pandemic, consist primarily of net non-cash lower of cost and net realizable value charges in cost of goods sold and impairment costs (goodwill, tradename and other assets) in SG&A.
Index
Fiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019
Net sales. Net sales increased $175.6 million, or 17.4%, to $1.18 billion for Fiscal 2020 from $1.01 billion for Fiscal 2019. Furthermore:
•We opened 24 new stores which included Hibbett stores rebranded to City Gear while closing 106 underperforming stores, primarily as part of our strategic realignment plan. We also expanded five high performing stores.
•Comparable store net sales for Fiscal 2020 increased 5.3% compared to Fiscal 2019 primarily due to strength in footwear and sneaker-connected apparel and accessories. These strengths were partially offset by softer sales in licensed products and team sports. For Fiscal 2020, 891 stores were included in the comparable store sales comparison.
•Stores not in the comparable store net sales calculation accounted for $129.2 million in net sales and includes the City Gear stores.
•E-commerce sales increased 41.3% compared to Fiscal 2019. The City Gear website was integrated into Hibbett's digital platform during the third quarter of Fiscal 2020.
•We saw an increase in average ticket and a decrease in items per transaction.
•We decreased our overall store count by a net of 82 stores in Fiscal 2020 primarily as a result of our accelerated store closure plan announced in Fiscal 2019.
Gross margin. Cost of goods sold included the cost of merchandise, occupancy costs for stores, occupancy and operating costs for our wholesale and logistics facility and ship-to-home freight. Gross margin was $383.5 million, or 32.4% of net sales, in Fiscal 2020, compared with $328.7 million, or 32.6% of net sales, in Fiscal 2019. Excluding the $1.0 million amortization of inventory step-up for City Gear, product margin decreased as a percentage of net sales primarily due to margin pressures from the complete liquidation of stores that were part of the strategic realignment plan. Product margin was also impacted by freight costs associated by higher e-commerce sales and markdown activity which resulted in a cleaner inventory position at the end of the fiscal year.
Logistics expenses were relatively flat as a percentage of net sales year over year. Store occupancy expense as a percentage of net sales improved primarily due to a lower overall store count. Adjusting for $1.1 million in net benefits related to our store closure plan, non-GAAP store occupancy improved as a percentage of net sales.
SG&A expenses. SG&A expenses were $318.0 million, or 26.9% of net sales, for Fiscal 2020, compared with $264.1 million, or 26.2% of net sales, for Fiscal 2019.
Excluding non-GAAP adjustments, SG&A expenses were $298.5 million, or 25.2% of net sales. This improvement on a non-GAAP basis as a percentage of net sales was predominately driven by leverage from higher sales in Fiscal 2020. Salary costs included a reduction in stock-based compensation of approximately $1.9 million related to the forfeiture of certain stock awards from employee departures. SG&A expenses also included a one-time charge related to the transition at the CEO position.
Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales was 2.5% in Fiscal 2020 and 2.7% in Fiscal 2019. The decrease was mainly due to leverage from higher sales.
Provision for income taxes. The combined federal, state and local effective income tax rate as a percentage of pre-tax income was 24.7% for Fiscal 2020 and 24.3% for Fiscal 2019. The increase in rate was primarily due to executive compensation deduction limitations under IRC Section 162(m) and fluctuations in the value of stock-based awards between the award grant and vesting dates.
Non-GAAP financial measures. The following table provides a reconciliation of our consolidated statement of operations for the fifty-two weeks ended February 1, 2020, as reported on a GAAP basis, to a statement of operations for the same period prepared on a non-GAAP basis.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation
(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)
1) Excluded acquisition amounts during the 52-week period ended February 1, 2020, related to the acquisition of City Gear, LLC, consist primarily of the amortization of inventory step-up in cost of goods sold and change in the valuation of contingent earnout, legal, accounting and professional fees in SG&A.
2) Excluded strategic realignment amounts during the 52-week period ended February 1, 2020, related to our accelerated store closure plan, consist primarily of gain on operating leases net of accelerated amortization on right-of-use assets in cost of goods sold and professional fees, impairment costs and loss on fixed assets in SG&A.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Liquidity
In response to the uncertain market conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic earlier in the fiscal year, we enhanced our liquidity position through the following actions:
•In March 2020, we borrowed $50.0 million, $25.0 million from each of our two separate $50.0 million unsecured, demand lines of credit. This was done as a precautionary measure in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility.
•In April 2020, we replaced these two lines of credit with a single $75.0 million secured line of credit with a one-year term and continued to have $50.0 million in outstanding borrowings. In June 2020, the term of the Amended Credit Facility was extended to July 2021. The outstanding $50.0 million balance was subsequently paid off during the second quarter of Fiscal 2021.
•We worked with merchandise and non-merchandise vendors to extend payment terms temporarily through the middle of the second quarter of Fiscal 2021.
•We negotiated rent deferrals with landlords at select locations.
As the result of strong second, third and fourth quarter sales, we ended Fiscal 2021 with $209.3 million of available cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet. As of January 30, 2021, we had no debt outstanding and full availability under the Amended Credit Facility.
Inventories at the end of Fiscal 2021 were $202.0 million, a 29.9% decrease compared to the end of Fiscal 2020. The continuing strength of sales in both the brick and mortar and e-commerce channels was the main driver of the lower inventory levels.
Analysis of Cash Flows
Our capital requirements relate primarily to new store openings, stock repurchases, facilities and systems to support company growth and working capital requirements. Our working capital requirements are somewhat seasonal in nature and typically reach
Index
their peak near the end of the third and the beginning of the fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Historically, we have funded our cash requirements primarily through our cash flow from operations and occasionally from borrowings under credit facilities. We use excess cash to invest in interest-bearing securities and money market accounts, as well as to offset bank fees.
Our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows (in thousands):
Operating Activities.
Cash flow from operations is seasonal in our business. Typically, we use cash flow from operations to increase inventory in advance of peak selling seasons, such as winter holidays, the spring sales period and late summer back-to-school shopping. Inventory levels are reduced in connection with higher sales during the peak selling seasons and this inventory reduction, combined with proportionately higher net income, typically produces a positive cash flow.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $197.7 million for the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2021 compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $92.3 million and $73.4 million for the 52 weeks ended February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for January 30, 2021, February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019 was impacted by the following:
•Net income provided cash of $74.3 million, $27.3 million and $28.4 million during Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively.
•Non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $29.6 million, $29.3 million and $27.1 million during Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively, and stock-based compensation expense of $3.8 million, $2.7 million and $4.3 million during Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively. Depreciation expense has increased in each fiscal year due to investments in facilities and information technology systems and due to accelerated depreciation taken in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019 resulting from an increase in store closures. Fluctuations in stock-based compensation generally result from the achievement of performance-based equity awards at greater or lesser than their granted level, fluctuations in the price of our common stock and levels of forfeitures in any given period.
•Other non-cash adjustments to net income for Fiscal 2021 included $37.1 million of asset impairment charges with the largest impact resulting from a significant temporary decrease in the market valuation of the Company at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by a $1.3 million change in the valuation of the contingent earnout related to City Gear.
•Ending inventory per store decreased 28.9% and increased 10.4% at January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, respectively compared to the prior year. Fiscal 2021 inventory decreased due to the significant lift in sales volume, supply chain constraints and proactive inventory management. Fiscal 2020 inventory increased on a per store basis mainly due to the acquisition of City Gear. The change in net inventory provided cash of $86.0 million during Fiscal 2021, used cash of $8.7 million during Fiscal 2020 and provided cash of $16.8 million during Fiscal 2019.
•The change in accounts payable used cash of $26.3 million in Fiscal 2021, provided cash of $24.3 million in Fiscal 2020 and used cash of $9.9 million in Fiscal 2019. Changes are due mainly to the timing of payments in relation to inventory receipts.
Investing Activities.
Cash used in investing activities in Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019 totaled $33.0 million, $17.0 million and $103.9 million, respectively. The large use of cash in Fiscal 2019 was due to the investment in City Gear in the amount of $86.8 million. Gross capital expenditures used $34.8 million, $17.3 million and $17.7 million during Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively. Capital expenditures in all periods primarily consisted of new stores, relocations, remodels and expansions of existing stores and IT projects.
Index
We opened 28 new stores and expanded and/or relocated 15 addition existing stores during Fiscal 2021. We opened 24 new stores and expanded and/or relocated 9 additional existing stores during Fiscal 2020. In the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019, we acquired 136 stores through the acquisition of City Gear, LLC In addition, we opened 32 new stores and expanded and/or relocated 10 existing stores in Fiscal 2019.
Our anticipated capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending January 29, 2022, will be approximately $45.0 million to $50.0 million, with the expenditures related to:
•Store development, including the opening of new stores and the remodeling, relocation or expansion of selected existing stores;
•Information system infrastructure, growth and efficiency projects, upgrades and security; and
•Other departmental needs for ongoing maintenance and support.
Financing Activities.
Net cash used in financing activities was $21.5 million in Fiscal 2021. Net cash used in financing activities was $71.0 million in Fiscal 2020 and net cash provided by financing activities was $18.7 million in Fiscal 2019. Historically, the fluctuation in net financing activities between years is primarily the result of borrowing activity and repurchases of our common stock. In Fiscal 2021, net borrowings on our credit facilities were zero. In Fiscal 2020, we paid off $35.0 million in borrowings that carried over from Fiscal 2019. We expended $17.6 million, $35.5 million and $16.5 million on repurchases of our common stock during Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively, which included cash used to settle net share equity awards of $0.9 million, $0.6 million and $0.4 million during Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively.
Additionally, in the second quarter of Fiscal 2021, we paid $10.0 million to the former members and warrant holders of City Gear for achievement of financial goals in the first-year post acquisition. Of this amount, $4.8 million was reflected as financing activities and represents the fair value of the short-term portion of the contingent earnout booked through the purchase price allocation.
Financing activities also consisted of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases. As stock options are exercised and shares are purchased through our employee stock purchase plan, we will continue to receive proceeds and expect a tax deduction; however, the amounts and timing cannot be predicted.
At January 30, 2021, we had one secured credit facility with Regions Bank (the Amended Credit Facility) that allows for borrowings up to $75 million and has an expiration date of July 18, 2021. Under the provisions of the Amended Credit Facility, we do not pay commitment fees; however, it is secured by all assets of the Company with the exception of real property. As of January 30, 2021, a total of $75.0 million was available to us from the Amended Credit Facility.
Purchase obligations, which include all legally binding contracts such as software license commitments and service contracts were $14.8 million and $18.0 million at January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, respectively. These purchase obligations are primarily due within five years and recorded as liabilities when goods are received or services rendered.
We issue inventory purchase orders in the ordinary course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancellable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments.
Other Economic Factors
Our ability to provide quality imported merchandise on a profitable basis may be subject to political and economic factors and influences that we cannot control. National or international events, including changes in government trade or other policies, could increase our merchandise costs and other costs that are critical to our operations. Consumer spending could also decline because of economic pressures.
Index
Our Critical Accounting Policies
Our significant accounting policies are described in Item 8, Note 1-Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies. Critical accounting policies are those that we believe are both (i) most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and (ii) require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of such policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.
We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting policies reflected in the consolidated financial statements are detailed below.
Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, when control of the merchandise is transferred to our customer. Sales are recorded net of expected returns at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise. Net sales exclude sales taxes because we are a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting these taxes.
The net deferred revenue liability for gift cards, customer orders and layaways at January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020 was $8.8 million and $7.7 million, respectively, recognized in accounts payable on our consolidated balance sheets. In Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, gift card breakage income was recognized in net sales in proportion to the redemption pattern of rights exercised by the customer and was immaterial for all years.
During the fiscal year ended January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, $1.2 million and $1.7 million of gift card deferred revenue from prior periods was realized, respectively.
Loyalty Program: We offer the Hibbett Rewards program whereby upon registration and in accordance with the terms of the program, customers earn points on certain purchases. Points convert into rewards at defined thresholds. The short-term future performance obligation liability is estimated at each reporting period based on historical conversion and redemption patterns. The liability is included in other accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheets and was $3.4 million and $2.7 million at January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, respectively.
Return Sales: The liability for return sales is estimated at each reporting period based on historical return patterns and is recognized at the transaction price. The liability is included in accounts payable on our consolidated balance sheets. The return asset and corresponding adjustment to cost of goods sold for our right to recover the merchandise returned by the customer is immaterial.
Inventories. Inventories are valued using the lower of weighted average cost or net realizable value method. Items are removed from inventory using the weighted average cost method.
Lower of Cost and Net Realizable Value: We regularly review inventories to determine if the carrying value exceeds net realizable value, and we record an accrual to reduce the carrying value to net realizable value as necessary. We account for obsolescence as part of our lower of cost and net realizable value accrual based on historical trends and specific identification. As of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, the accrual was $6.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively. A determination of net realizable value requires significant judgment.
Shrink Reserves: We accrue for inventory shrinkage based on the actual historical results of our physical inventory counts. These estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are performed and reconciled to the general ledger. Physical inventory counts are performed on a cyclical basis. As of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, the accrual was $1.9 million and $1.6 million, respectively.
Inventory Purchase Concentration: Our business is dependent to a significant degree upon close relationships with our vendors. Our largest vendor, Nike, represented 65.0%, 67.7% and 65.4% of our purchases for Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively. Our second largest vendor, adidas, represented 6.6%, 7.2% and 10.0% of our purchases for Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets. Goodwill and the City Gear tradename are indefinite-lived intangible assets which are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually, or on an interim basis if events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that is more likely than not that an asset is impaired. Such events or circumstances could include, but are not limited to, significant negative industry or economic trends, unanticipated changes in the competitive environment and a

significant sustained decline in the market price of our stock. If an asset is impaired, an impairment test is performed and the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value is recorded as an impairment charge to current income.
Due to the macroeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we determined that indicators of impairment were present during the first quarter of Fiscal 2021. As a result, we performed interim impairment testing on goodwill and the City Gear tradename as of April 15, 2020, using updated assumptions around prospective financial information, growth rates, discount rates applied to future cash flows, and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry.
In valuing goodwill, we use a combination of the Discounted Cash Flow methodology and the Guideline Public Company methodology, which require assumptions be made related to future cash flows, discount rate and comparable public companies. In the first quarter of Fiscal 2021, we determined that goodwill of our City Gear reporting unit was fully impaired and recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $19.7 million. No impairment related to goodwill was recognized during Fiscal 2020.
A reconciliation of goodwill from February 1, 2020 to January 30, 2021 consists of the following:
In valuing the tradename intangible, we use the Relief from Royalty method which requires assumptions related to future revenues, royalty rate and discount rate. In the first quarter of Fiscal 2021, we determined that the City Gear tradename was partially impaired and recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $8.9 million in store operating, selling and administrative expenses on our condensed consolidated statement of operations. No impairment related to the tradename was recognized during Fiscal 2020.
A reconciliation of tradename from February 1, 2020 to January 30, 2021 consists of the following:
Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets, including lease assets, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. When evaluating long-lived assets for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. Our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is based on historical operations and predictions of future profitability. Significant assumptions are required to estimate cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of assets in operations, including margin on net sales, occupancy costs, payroll and related costs, and other costs to operate a store. If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the related asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the related asset or asset group to its estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model, quoted market value, or other valuation technique, as appropriate. We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. For depreciable long-lived assets, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining estimated useful life of that asset. Impairment loss calculations require significant judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values.
