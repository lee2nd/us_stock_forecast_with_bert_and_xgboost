Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
BUSINESS
Salisbury, a Connecticut corporation, formed in 1998, is the bank holding company for the Bank, a Connecticut-chartered and FDIC insured commercial bank headquartered in Lakeville, Connecticut. Salisbury's principal business consists of the business of the Bank. The Bank, formed in 1848, is engaged in customary banking activities, including general deposit taking and lending activities to both retail and commercial markets, and trust and wealth advisory services. The Bank conducts its banking business from fourteen full-service offices in the towns of: Canaan, Lakeville, Salisbury and Sharon, Connecticut; Great Barrington, South Egremont and Sheffield, Massachusetts; and, Fishkill, Newburgh, New Paltz, Poughkeepsie, Red Oaks Mill, Dover Plains and Millerton, New York, and its trust and wealth advisory services from offices in Lakeville, Connecticut.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Salisbury’s consolidated financial statements follow U.S. GAAP as applied to the banking industry in which it operates. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not carried at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event.
Salisbury’s significant accounting policies are presented in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which, along with this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, provide information on how significant assets are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating Salisbury’s reported financial results, and they require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
The allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the balance sheet. Note 1 describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses. A discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the “Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis.
Management, with the assistance of a third party, evaluates goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment annually using valuation techniques that involve observations and adjustments as to comparable transactions, estimates for discount rates, projected future cash flows and time period calculations, all of which are susceptible to change based on changes in economic conditions and other factors.
For both goodwill and for the core deposit intangible, the comparable transaction methodology was used to assess, and conclude that there was no impairment at November 30, 2020. The current discounted economic value methodology was also used to test for goodwill impairment.
Future events, or changes in the estimates, which are used to determine the carrying value of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets or which otherwise adversely affect their value or estimated lives could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations.
Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment giving consideration to the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, estimates of future cash flows, delinquencies and default severity, the intent and ability of Salisbury to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value, and the likelihood that Salisbury will be required to sell the security before recovery in fair value to meet liquidity needs. The consideration of the above factors is subjective and involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Should actual factors and conditions differ materially from those used by management, the actual realization of gains or losses on investment securities could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements.
The following discussion and analysis of Salisbury's consolidated results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
COVID-19 has placed significant health and economic pressure on the communities the Bank serves, the State of Connecticut, the United States and other countries. In response, the Bank has proactively implemented several steps such as those set forth below to support the safety and well-being of its employees and customers, which procedures continue through the date of this Report:
· The Bank is practicing social distancing following the guidelines of the Center for Disease Control and requires many of its employees to work from home or from alternate locations. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 25% of Salisbury’s employees worked from home or alternate locations.
· The Bank continues to leverage the drive-up windows in twelve of its fourteen branches as well as its electronic banking platform to continue to serve customers.
Salisbury will continue to monitor this pandemic as the situation continues to evolve and adjust its operating model accordingly.
Net Interest and Dividend Income
Net interest and dividend income (presented on a tax-equivalent basis) increased $4.1 million, or 11.9%, in 2020 over 2019. The net interest margin increased 1 basis point to 3.28% from 3.27%, due to a 57 basis point decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities partly offset by a 43 basis point decrease in the average yield on interest-earning assets. The net interest margin was affected by changes in the mix of interest-earning assets and funding liabilities, asset and liability growth, and the effects of changes in market interest rates on the pricing and re-pricing of assets and liabilities. The following table sets forth the components of Salisbury's net interest income and yields on average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing funds. Income and yields on tax-exempt securities are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis.
(a) Includes non-accrual loans.
(b) Includes interest-bearing deposits in other banks and federal funds sold.
(c) Average balances of securities are based on amortized cost.
(d) Includes tax exempt income of $0.7 million, $0.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively for 2020, 2019 and 2018 on tax-exempt securities and loans for which income and yields are calculated on a tax-equivalent basis.
(e) Net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.
(f) Interest income for 2020, 2019 and 2018 reflected net accretion related to the fair value adjustments of loans acquired in the Riverside Bank acquisition in the amount of $0 million, $0 million and $0.8 million, respectively.
The following table sets forth the changes in net interest income (presented on a tax-equivalent basis) due to volume and rate.
Net interest and dividend income represents the difference between interest and dividends earned on loans and securities and interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowings. The level of net interest income is a function of volume, rates and mix of both earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income can be affected by changes in interest rate levels, changes in the volume of assets and liabilities that are subject to re-pricing within different future time periods, and in the level of non-performing assets.
Interest and Dividend Income
Tax equivalent interest and dividend income of $44.1 million in 2020 was essentially unchanged from 2019. Loan income increased $1.1 million, or 2.7%, to $41.3 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $97.1 million, or 10.5%, increase in average loans, which was partly offset by a 33 basis point decrease in average yield.
Tax equivalent interest and dividend income from securities decreased $377 thousand, or 12.8%, to $2.6 million in 2020, as a result of a $6.5 million, or 6.8%, decrease in average security balances, and a 20 basis point decrease in average yield. Interest from short term funds decreased $521 thousand in 2020 as a result of a 164 basis point decrease in average yield, partially offset by a $29.8 million, or 82.6%, increase in average short term balances.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased $4.0 million, or 75.9%, to $5.3 million in 2020. Interest expense on interest bearing deposit accounts decreased $3.4 million, or 46.9%, to $3.9 million in 2020, as a result of a $47.5 million, or 6.7%, increase in average interest-bearing deposits and a 52 basis point decrease in the average rate to 0.51%. Interest expense on money market accounts decreased $1.2 million, or 50.9%, due to a 60 basis point decline in the average rate partly offset by a $34.3 million, or 15.4% increase in average balance. Interest expense on savings and other accounts decreased $1.1 million, or 69.4%, due to a 61 basis point decline in the average rate. Interest expense on certificates of deposits decreased $1.0 million, or 35.9%,due to 53 basis point decline in the average rate and a $15.3 million, or 9.6% decrease in average balance. The decrease in the average certificate of deposit balance from 2019 reflected a $12.5 million decrease in average one-way buys executed through the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”). CDARS is a product offered by Promontory Interfinancial Network that enables participating financial institutions to buy or sell excess funds to other members to fund operations and to manage liquidity.
Interest expense on FHLBB advances decreased $538 thousand, or 47.1%, due to a 149 basis point decrease in the average borrowing rate to 1.49%, partly offset by a $1.8 million, or 4.7%, increase in average advances.
In December 2015, Salisbury issued $10 million of subordinated debentures. The proceeds of such issuance, along with cash-on-hand, were used by Salisbury to fully redeem $16 million of its outstanding Series B Preferred Stock, which was issued pursuant to the participation in the U.S. Treasury’s SBLF program. Interest expense on the subordinated debt for 2020 and 2019 was $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively.
Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses
The provision for loan losses was $5.0 million for 2020, compared with $1.0 million for 2019. Net loan charge-offs were $0.2 million and $0.6 million, for the respective years. The higher provision for loan losses in 2020 primarily reflected management’s assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on certain qualitative and environmental factors and impaired loans as well as loan growth. Management will continue to monitor the impact of the virus on its borrowers and adjust the allowance as appropriate. The length of time required for the economy to substantially recover from the virus will have a direct impact on Salisbury’s provision and allowance for loan losses. A longer recovery or another forced shutdown that leads to sustained levels of unemployment will likely result in an increase in Salisbury’s provision and allowance for loan losses.
The following table sets forth changes in the allowance for loan losses and other statistical data:
The reserve coverage at December 31, 2020, as measured by the ratio of allowance for loan losses to gross loans, was 1.32%, as compared with 0.95% at December 31, 2019. Excluding loans advanced under the SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program, the ratio of the allowance to gross loans was 1.44% at December 31, 2020. Non-performing loans (non-accrual loans and accruing loans past-due 90 days or more) increased $2.0 million to $5.6 million, or 0.54% of gross loans receivable, at December 31, 2020, up from $3.6 million or 0.39% of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2019. The increase in non-performing loans from the prior year end primarily reflected loans of $3.7 million placed on non-accrual status partly offset by loan sales of $0.7 million, loan payments of $0.5 million and loans returned to accruing status of $0.5 million. Accruing loans past due 30-89 days increased from $2.1 million, or 0.22%, of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2019 to $6.8 million, or 0.66%, of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2020. The increase included loans of $3.0 million that matured in fourth quarter 2020, most of which are expected to renew in first quarter 2021. See “Overview - Loan Credit Quality” below for further discussion and analysis.
Non-Interest Income
The following table details the principal categories of non-interest income.
Non-interest income increased $1.0 million, or 11.6%, in 2020 versus 2019. Trust and Wealth Advisory revenues increased $199 thousand mainly due to growth in asset-based fees. Service charges and fees decreased $956 thousand from 2019. During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020, Salisbury waived approximately $754 thousand in various deposit fees, including overdraft and ATM fees, to support customers affected by COVID-19. These fees were reinstituted in late November 2020. Mortgage banking activities, net increased $1.2 million on higher sales volume. Mortgage loan sales totaled $59.8 million in 2020 versus $6.4 million in 2019. Loans serviced under the FHLBB Mortgage Partnership Finance Program totaled $134.4 million and $106.3 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2020, the Bank recorded a non-taxable gain of $601 thousand related to proceeds received from a BOLI policy due to the death of a covered former employee. Other income primarily includes rental property income.
Non-Interest Expense
The following table details the principal categories of non-interest expense.
Non-interest expenses increased $126 thousand, or 0.4%, in 2020 versus 2019. Salaries decreased $220 thousand as higher production and incentive accruals as well as higher overtime costs were more than offset by an increase in deferred compensation costs associated with originating loans, including PPP loans. Benefits increased $149 thousand compared to the same period in 2019. The increase was primarily due to a one-time reduction of $328 thousand received in the fourth quarter 2019 due to the modification of key terms of agreements related to BOLI policies and higher accruals for performance based restricted stock units, partly offset by lower expenses for phantom stock appreciation units. See Note 16 for a further discussion of Salisbury’s Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plans. Premises and equipment increased $3 thousand mainly due to increased software expense partially offset by lower depreciation, building maintenance and utilities costs. Data processing increased $10 thousand mainly due to ATM fees and core data processing costs partially offset by lower Trust and Wealth data processing expense. The increase in professional fees of $528 thousand versus the twelve month period 2019 primarily reflected higher consulting and investment management expenses, partly offset by lower legal costs. Collections, OREO and loan related expense decreased $113 thousand due to OREO losses in the twelve month period 2019. The increase in FDIC insurance expense primarily reflected non-recurring assessment credits of $240 thousand received in 2019. Marketing and community support costs decreased $46 thousand compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to lower marketing expenditures partially offset by increased contributions. Amortization of intangible assets decreased $67 thousand due to the aging off of expenses related to previous acquisitions. Other expenses increased $85 thousand and primarily reflected accruals related to litigation matters occurring in the normal course of business.
Income Taxes
The effective income tax rates for 2020 and 2019 were 17.0% and 17.5%, respectively. Salisbury’s effective tax rate was less than the 21% federal statutory rate due to tax-exempt income, primarily from municipal bonds, tax advantaged loans and bank-owned life insurance. Fluctuations in the effective tax rate generally result from changes in the mix of taxable and tax-exempt income. For further information on income taxes, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Salisbury did not incur Connecticut income tax in 2020, 2019 or 2018, other than minimum state income tax, as a result of a Connecticut law that permits banks to shelter certain mortgage income from the Connecticut corporation business tax through the use of a special purpose entity called a Passive Investment Company or PIC. Salisbury avails itself of this benefit through its PIC, SBT Mortgage Service Corporation. Salisbury's income tax provision reflects the full impact of the Connecticut legislation. Salisbury does not expect to pay other than minimum Connecticut state income tax in the foreseeable future unless there is a change in Connecticut tax law.
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
Net Interest and Dividend Income
Net interest and dividend income represents the difference between interest and dividends earned on loans and securities and interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowings. The level of net interest income is a function of volume, rates and mix of both earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income can be affected by changes in interest rate levels, changes in the volume of assets and liabilities that are subject to re-pricing within different future time periods, and in the level of non-performing assets.
Interest and Dividend Income
Tax equivalent interest and dividend income increased $3.2 million, or 7.8%, to $44.0 million in 2019. Loan income increased $2.7 million, or 7.1%, to $40.2 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $51.3 million, or 5.9%, increase in average loans, and a 5 basis point increase in average yield. Interest income for 2019 and 2018 reflects purchase accounting adjustments consisting of net accretion related to the fair value adjustments of loans acquired in the Riverside Bank acquisition in the amount of $0 million and $0.8 million, respectively.
Tax equivalent interest and dividend income from securities increased $0.5 million, or 22.2%, to $2.9 million in 2019, as a result of a $8.3 million, or 9.4%, increase in average security balances, and a 32 basis point increase in average yield. Interest from short term funds decreased $20 thousand in 2019 as a result of a 19 basis point increase in average yield, partially offset by a $5.2 million, or 12.7%, decrease in average short term balances.
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased $2.1 million, or 28.8%, to $9.3 million in 2019. Interest expense on interest bearing deposit accounts increased $2.7 million, or 57.2%, to $7.3 million in 2019, as a result of a $63.2 million, or 9.7%, increase in average interest-bearing deposits and a 31 basis point increase in the average rate to 1.03%. The increase in the average certificate of deposit balance from 2018 reflected higher average brokered certificates of deposits balances of $20.3 million and a $3.0 million increase in average one-way buys executed through the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”). CDARS is a product offered by Promontory Interfinancial Network that enables participating financial institutions to buy or sell excess funds to other members to fund operations and to manage liquidity.
Interest expense on FHLBB advances decreased $0.6 million, or 34.1%, due to a $25.9 million, or 40.4%, decrease in average advances, partially offset by a 28 basis point increase in the average borrowing rate to 2.98%.
In December 2015, Salisbury issued $10 million of subordinated debentures. The proceeds of such issuance, along with cash-on-hand, were used by Salisbury to fully redeem $16 million of its outstanding Series B Preferred Stock, which was issued pursuant to the participation in the U.S. Treasury’s SBLF program. Interest expense on the subordinated debt for 2019 and 2018 was $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively.
Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses
The provision for loan losses was $1.0 million for 2019, compared with $1.7 million for 2018. Net loan charge-offs were $0.6 million and $0.7 million, for the respective years. The lower provision for loan losses in 2019 primarily reflected lower originations. In first quarter 2019, Salisbury transferred the remaining unearned credit-related discount on loans acquired in its 2014 acquisition of Riverside Bank to the allowance for loan loss reserves. As a result of this transfer, gross loans receivable and the allowance for loan losses increased by $0.7 million. The balance of net loans receivable did not change as a result of this transfer.	
The reserve coverage at December 31, 2019, as measured by the ratio of allowance for loan losses to gross loans, was 0.95%, as compared with 0.85% at December 31, 2018. Non-performing loans (non-accrual loans and accruing loans past-due 90 days or more) decreased $2.9 million to $3.6 million, or 0.39% of gross loans receivable, at December 31, 2019, down from $6.5 million or 0.71% of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2018. The decline in non-performing loans from the prior year end primarily reflected pay-offs of $1.6 million, upgrades to performing status of $0.9 million and write-downs of $0.4 million. Accruing loans past due 30-89 days decreased $0.1 million to $2.1 million, or 0.22% of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2019. See “Overview - Loan Credit Quality” below for further discussion and analysis.
Non-Interest Income
Non-interest income increased $305 thousand, or 3.4%, in 2019 versus 2018. Trust and Wealth Advisory revenues increased $295 thousand primarily due to increased market values and a higher volume of assets under management. Service charges and fees increased $310 thousand from 2018 on higher interchange and wire fees as well as higher loan prepayment penalties. Gains on sales of mortgage loans increased $27 thousand on higher sales volume. Mortgage loans sales totaled $6.4 million in 2019 versus $4.6 million in 2018. Loans serviced under the FHLBB Mortgage Partnership Finance Program totaled $106.3 million and $111.4 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2018, the Bank recorded a non-taxable gain of $341 thousand related to proceeds received from a BOLI policy due to the death of a covered former employee.
Non-Interest Expense
Non-interest expenses decreased $923 thousand, or 3.1%, in 2019 versus 2018. Salaries expense increased $45 thousand due to higher base salaries, merit increases, and short-term incentive accruals partly offset by lower production accruals due to lower loan volume. Employee benefits expense for 2019 included a non-recurring reduction of $328 thousand, which reflected changes to the calculation of death benefits for bank-owned life insurance policies. This credit, as well as lower 401K and ESOP accruals, was more than offset by higher medical insurance costs and higher deferred compensation accruals. Premises and equipment expense decreased $519 thousand from 2018 as the prior year included a charge of $171 thousand to write-off the remainder of the lease and fixed assets related to the Bank’s previously occupied Fishkill, New York branch location as well as a charge of $95 thousand to write-off the remaining term of a third-party software contract. Software maintenance costs and depreciation costs were also lower. Data processing expense increased $82 thousand mainly as a result of higher core data processing costs. The decrease of $23 thousand in professional fees reflected lower consulting and internal audit costs partly offset by higher external audit and regulatory exam costs, as well as higher investment management expenses. OREO losses and write-downs increased $133 thousand from 2018. Collections, OREO and appraisal expenses decreased $142 thousand primarily due to lower appraisal fees, lower carrying costs and lower taxes. The $318 thousand decrease in FDIC insurance reflected $240 thousand in non-recurring assessment credits received by the Bank in 2019. Marketing and community support decreased $196 thousand due to costs incurred in the prior year for the Fishkill, New York branch relocation, the timing of contributions and lower overall marketing spend. Amortization of intangibles and all other operating expenses collectively decreased $89 thousand from 2018.
Income Taxes
The effective income tax rates for 2019 and 2018 were 17.5% and 16.2%, respectively. Salisbury’s effective tax rate was less than the 21% federal statutory rate due to tax-exempt income, primarily from municipal bonds, tax advantaged loans and bank-owned life insurance. Fluctuations in the effective tax rate generally result from changes in the mix of taxable and tax-exempt income. For further information on income taxes, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Salisbury did not incur Connecticut income tax in 2019, 2018 or 2017, other than minimum state income tax, as a result of a Connecticut law that permits banks to shelter certain mortgage income from the Connecticut corporation business tax through the use of a special purpose entity called a Passive Investment Company or PIC. Salisbury avails itself of this benefit through its PIC, SBT Mortgage Service Corporation. Salisbury's income tax provision reflects the full impact of the Connecticut legislation. Salisbury does not expect to pay other than minimum Connecticut state income tax in the foreseeable future unless there is a change in Connecticut tax law.
Overview
Assets
During 2020, Salisbury’s assets increased by $181.2 million to $1.294 billion, while net loans increased $100.3 million at December 31, 2020. Asset and loan growth included approximately $85 million of PPP loans. Salisbury also experienced a significant build up in cash balances as a result of the funding of the PPP loans. The balance of cash and cash equivalents increased $66.3 million to $93.2 million at December 31, 2020. Salisbury has employed excess cash to pay down borrowings and invest in additional available-for-sale securities. At December 31, 2020, Salisbury’s tangible book value and book value per common share were $38.78 and $43.88, respectively. At December 31, 2020, the Bank’s Tier 1 leverage and total risk-based capital ratios were 8.90% and 13.57%, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank was categorized as "well capitalized."
Securities and Short-Term Funds
During 2020, securities increased $5.1 million to $101.0 million, while short-term funds (cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with other banks) increased $66.3 million to $93.2 million. The carrying values of securities are as follows:
Salisbury evaluates securities for OTTI where the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost basis at the balance sheet date. As part of this process, Salisbury considers whether it has the intent to sell each debt security and whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery. If either of these conditions is met, Salisbury recognizes an OTTI charge to earnings equal to the entire difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. For securities that meet neither of these conditions, an analysis is performed to determine if any of these securities are at risk for OTTI.
Salisbury evaluates securities for strategic fit and may reduce its position in securities, although it is not more likely than not that Salisbury will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their cost basis, which may be maturity, and does not intend to sell these securities. Management does not consider any of its securities to be OTTI at December 31, 2020. It is possible that future loss assumptions could change necessitating Salisbury to recognize future OTTI. Salisbury evaluates securities for strategic fit and may reduce its position in securities, although it is not more likely than not that Salisbury will be required to sell securities before recovery of their cost basis, which may be maturity.
Accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2020 included net unrealized holding gains, net of tax, of $3.0 million, which is an increase of $1.6 million from December 31, 2019.
Loans
During 2020, net loans receivable increased $100.3 million, or 11%, to $1.027 billion at December 31, 2020. Salisbury’s retail lending department originates residential mortgage, home equity loans and lines of credit, and consumer loans for the portfolio. During 2020, Salisbury originated a record $147.6 million of residential mortgage loans and $9.0 million of home equity loans for the portfolio, compared with $53.4 million and $7.5 million, respectively, in 2019. During 2020, total residential mortgage and home equity loans receivable declined by $1.7 million to $425.7 million at December 31, 2020, and represent 40.9% of gross loans receivable. During 2020, Salisbury’s residential mortgage lending department also originated and sold $59.8 million of residential mortgage loans, compared with $6.4 million during 2019. All such sold loans were sold through the FHLBB Mortgage Partnership Finance Program with servicing retained by Salisbury. Consumer loans, amounted to $7.9 million at December 31, 2020, representing 0.7% of gross loans receivable.
Salisbury’s commercial lending department specializes in lending to small and mid-size companies, businesses and municipalities. More specifically, we meet our clients’ credit needs by providing short-term and long-term financing, construction loans, commercial mortgages, equipment, working capital, property improvement loans and municipal financing. The department also works with both the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) and United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) Government Guaranteed Lending Programs; however, such loans represent a very small percent of the commercial loan portfolio. Salisbury originated $221.8 million of commercial loans during 2020 compared with $155.4 million in 2019. Total commercial loans, which include commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and municipal loans, increased $101.6 million to $591.2 million at December 31, 2020, and represent 56.7% of gross loans receivable. Additionally, in 2020, Salisbury processed 932 loan applications for nearly $100 million under the SBA’s PPP program. At December 31, 2020 approximately $85 million of these loans remained on Salisbury’s balance sheet. These loans are categorized as “commercial and industrial” in the table below.
The principal categories of loans receivable and loans held-for-sale are as follows:
The composition of loans receivable by forecasted maturity distribution is as follows:
The composition of loans receivable with either fixed, variable or adjustable interest rates is as follows:
Loan Credit Quality
Salisbury has cooperative relationships with the vast majority of its non-performing loan customers. Substantially all non-performing loans are collateralized with real estate and the repayment of such loans is largely dependent on the return of such loans to performing status or the liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral. Salisbury pursues the resolution of all non-performing loans through collections, restructures, voluntary liquidation of collateral by the borrower and, where necessary, legal action. When attempts to work with a customer to return a loan to performing status, including restructuring the loan, are unsuccessful, Salisbury will initiate appropriate legal action seeking to acquire property by deed in lieu of foreclosure or through foreclosure, or to liquidate business assets.
On March 22, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an “Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus”, this guidance encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers that may be unable to meet their contractual obligations because of the effects of the virus. The guidance goes on to explain that the federal banking agencies conclude that short-term modifications (e.g. six months) made on a good faith basis to borrowers who were current as of the implementation date of the relief program are not Troubled Debt Restructurings (“TDRs”). Section 4013 of the CARES Act addresses modifications resulting from the pandemic and specified that virus related modifications on loans that were current as of December 31, 2019 are not TDRs. The Bank has applied Section 4013 guidance and implemented a loan payment deferral program which allows residential, commercial and consumer borrowers, who have been adversely affected by the virus and whose loans were not more than 30 days past due at December 31, 2019, to defer loan payments for up to three months. Borrowers may apply to the Bank for additional deferments, which will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
As of December 31, 2020, 15 commercial loans ($29.8 million loan balances) were granted payment deferrals. Approximately sixty percent of the deferred loan payments ($17.9 million loan balance) related to borrowers in the hospitality industry and another thirty percent ($8.5 million loan balance) related to borrowers in the entertainment & recreation industry. The loan balance for which payments were deferred represented approximately 3.1% of Salisbury’s gross loan balance at December 31, 2020, excluding loans granted under the SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program. There were no outstanding deferrals related to residential and consumer loans as of December 31, 2020. The Bank will continue to accrue interest on such deferred payments, which will be added to a borrower’s final payment. Salisbury evaluated each borrower’s request for loan payment deferrals on a case-by case-basis. Salisbury also reviewed the credit characteristics and internal risk rating assigned to each borrower that was granted a deferral. This review considered several factors, which included an assessment of COVID-19’s impact on the operations of the business, other sources of liquidity available to a borrower for loan payments, the borrower’s cooperation, the value of collateral and the number of payment deferrals granted to that borrower. Salisbury also considered a borrower’s ability to make partial payments, which represent a subset or combination of principal, interest and mortgage taxes. At December 31, 2020, six of the loans deferring payments were deferring principal only, eight loans were deferring principal and interest and one loan was deferring principal and mortgage taxes.
The CARES Act provides emergency economic relief to individuals and businesses impacted by the virus. The CARES Act authorized the SBA to temporarily guarantee loans under a new 7(a) loan program called the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”). As a qualified SBA lender, the Bank was automatically qualified to originate loans under the PPP. Salisbury processed 932 PPP loans for a principal balance of approximately $100 million primarily for existing customers. The expected forgiveness amount is the amount of loan principal the lender reasonably expects the borrower to spend on payroll costs, mortgage interest, rent and utilities during the covered period after the loans are funded. On June 5, 2020, the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act (“PPPFA”) was signed into law. The PPPFA increased the covered period from eight weeks to twenty-four weeks, reduced the portion of the loan that must be spent on payroll costs from 75% to 60% and extended the term of loans that are not forgiven from two years to five years. For PPP loans originated prior to June 5, 2020, borrowers and lenders may mutually agree to increase the loan term to five years. The vast majority of PPP loans processed by Salisbury have a two-year term. Management funded these short-term loans through a combination of deposits, short-term Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, and brokered deposits. Salisbury did not participate in the Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (“PPPLF”). As of December 31, 2020, Salisbury had approximately $85 million of PPP loans on its balance sheet.
On December 27, 2020 the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 was signed into law. Certain provisions of the CARES Act were modified and extended by the Act. One of the features of the Act was the provision of $284 billion in additional funding for the PPP program, including a Second draw Paycheck Protection Program for qualifying businesses for which there was a quarterly revenue reduction of at least 25% compared to the same quarter in 2019. Salisbury will participate in the additional PPP program, which began in January 2021. Salisbury expects the demand for second draws to be lower. The Bank will fund the loans through deposits, short-term FHLB advances or brokered certificate of deposits, as necessary.
Past Due Loans
Loans past due 30 days or more increased $5.5 million during 2020 to $9.9 million, or 0.95% of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2020, compared with $4.4 million, or 0.47% of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2019. The increase included loans of $3.0 million that matured during fourth quarter 2020, most of which are expected to renew in first quarter 2021.
The components of loans past due 30 days or greater are as follows:
Credit Quality Segments
Salisbury categorizes loans receivable into the following credit quality segments.
· Impaired loans consist of all non-accrual loans and troubled debt restructured loans, and represent loans for which it is probable that Salisbury will not be able to collect all principal and interest amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements.
· Non-accrual loans, a sub-set of impaired loans, are loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued because, in the opinion of management, full collection of principal or interest is unlikely.
· Non-performing loans consist of non-accrual loans, and accruing loans past due 90 days and over that are well collateralized, in the process of collection and where full collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured. Non-performing assets consist of non-performing loans plus real estate acquired in settlement of loans.
· Troubled debt restructured loans are loans for which concessions such as reduction of interest rates, other than normal market rate adjustments, or deferral of principal or interest payments, extension of maturity dates, or reduction of principal balance or accrued interest, have been granted due to a borrower’s financial condition. Loan restructuring is employed when management believes the granting of a concession will increase the probability of the full or partial collection of principal and interest.
· Potential problem loans consist of performing loans that have been assigned a substandard credit risk rating and are not classified as impaired.
Non-Performing Assets
Non-performing assets increased $1.7 million to $5.6 million at December 31, 2020, or 0.44% of assets, from $3.9 million or 0.35% of assets at December 31, 2019. The increase from the prior year end primarily reflected loans of $3.7 million placed on non-accrual status partly offset by loan sales of $0.7 million, loan payments of $0.5 million and loans of $0.5 million which returned to accruing status. The components of non-performing assets are as follows:
Reductions in interest income associated with non-accrual loans are as follows:
The past due status of non-performing loans is as follows:
At December 31, 2020, 45.06% of non-performing loans were current with respect to loan payments, compared with 35.39% at December 31, 2019. Loans past due 180 days and over are substantially all mortgage loans in the process of foreclosure or litigation.
Salisbury endeavors to work constructively to resolve its non-performing loan issues with customers. Substantially all non-performing loans are collateralized with real estate and the repayment of such loans is largely dependent on the return of such loans to performing status or the liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral.
Troubled Debt Restructured Loans
Troubled debt restructured loans decreased $1.0 million in 2020 to $7.8 million, or 0.75% of gross loans receivable, from $8.8 million, or 0.94% of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2019. The components of troubled debt restructured loans are as follows:
The past due status of troubled debt restructured loans is as follows:
At December 31, 2020, 76.41% of troubled debt restructured loans were current with respect to loan payments, as compared with 82.43% at December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, there were specific reserves on troubled debt restructured loans amounting to $397 thousand, $582 thousand, and $252 thousand, respectively.
Potential Problem Loans
Potential problem loans consist of performing loans that have been assigned a substandard credit risk rating and are not classified as impaired. Potential problem loans increased $8.3 million during 2020 to $18.2 million, or 1.75% of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2020, compared with $9.9 million, or 1.06% of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2019. The increase reflected the downgrade of two commercial loans of $9.5 million, partly offset by the payoff of a commercial & industrial line of credit of $0.8 million and other activity of $0.4 million. The components of potential problem loans were as follows:
The past due status of potential problem loans was as follows:
At December 31, 2020, 96.70% of potential problem loans were current with respect to loan payments, as compared with 97.49% at December 31, 2019. Management cannot predict the extent to which economic or other factors may impact such borrowers’ future payment capacity, and there can be no assurance that such loans will not be placed on nonaccrual status, restructured, or require increased provisions for loan losses.
Deposits and Borrowings
Deposits increased $209.6 million during 2020, or 23%, to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2020, compared with $919.5 million at December 31, 2019. The increase in deposits partly reflected the funding of PPP loans in 2020. Retail repurchase agreements decreased $1.4 million during 2020 to $7.1 million at December 31, 2020, compared with $8.5 million at December 31, 2019.
The distribution of average total deposits by account type was as follows:
The classification of certificates of deposit by interest rates was as follows:
The distribution of certificates of deposit by interest rate and maturity was as follows:
Scheduled maturities of time certificates of deposit in denominations of $100 thousand or more were as follows:
FHLBB advances decreased $38.2 million during 2020 to $12.6 million at December 31, 2020, compared with $50.9 million at December 31, 2019. The net decrease primarily reflected net new amortizing borrowings of $10.0 million offset by $30.0 million of maturities and $3.2 million of amortization in 2020. In addition, in fourth quarter 2020 Salisbury utilized excess cash to prepay a $15 million advance that was scheduled to mature in July 2021. Salisbury incurred a penalty of approximately $60 thousand as a result of this prepayment. Salisbury also has an Irrevocable Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement with the FHLBB, whereby upon the Bank’s request an irrevocable letter of credit is issued to secure municipal and certain other transactional deposit accounts. These letters of credit are secured primarily by residential mortgage loans. The amount of funds available from the FHLBB to the Bank is reduced by any letters of credit outstanding. At December 31, 2020, $20.0 million of letters of credit were outstanding compared with $18.0 million at December 31, 2019. Salisbury’s excess borrowing capacity at the FHLB was $255.5 million compared with $233.7 million at December 31, 2019. The increase in capacity reflected the pledging of additional residential and commercial loans as collateral.
The following table sets forth certain information concerning short-term FHLBB advances:
Subordinated Debentures
In December 2015, Salisbury completed the issuance of $10.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Fixed to Floating Rate Subordinated Notes Due 2025 (the “Notes”) in a private placement transaction to various accredited investors including $500 thousand to certain of Salisbury’s related parties. The Notes have a maturity date of December 15, 2025 and bear interest at an annual rate of 6.00% from and including the original issue date of the Notes to, but excluding, December 15, 2020 or the earlier redemption date payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year. Thereafter, from and including December 15, 2020 to, but excluding, December 15, 2025, the terms of the note payable provide that the annual interest rate will be reset quarterly and equal to the three-month LIBOR, plus 430 basis points, as described in the Notes, payable quarterly, in arrears, on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year during the time that the Notes remain outstanding through December 15, 2025 or earlier redemption date. Salisbury is monitoring the industry’s transition from LIBOR as a market reference rate. The Notes are redeemable, without penalty, on or after December 15, 2020 and, in certain limited circumstances, prior to that date. As more completely described in the Notes, the indebtedness evidenced by the Notes, including principal and interest, is unsecured and subordinate and junior in right of Salisbury’s payments to general and secured creditors and depositors of the Bank. The Notes also contain provisions with respect to redemption features and other matters pertaining to the Notes. The Notes have been structured to qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes, subject to applicable limitations. As a result of the Notes being within five (5) years of their maturity date, Tier 2 capital at the parent company only will decrease in an amount equal to 20.0% of the outstanding Notes per year until the Notes mature in 2025 or are earlier redeemed.
Subordinated debentures totaled $9.9 million at December 31, 2020, which includes $117 thousand of remaining unamortized debt issuance costs. The debt issuance costs are being amortized to maturity. The effective interest rate of the subordinated debentures is 6.25%.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS
In the normal course of business, Salisbury enters into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligations at December 31, 2020 include operating leases, capital leases, contractual purchases and certain other benefit plans. For further discussion regarding leases see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The accompanying table summarizes Salisbury’s off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments and significant cash obligations, by remaining maturity, at December 31, 2020. Salisbury’s lending-related financial instruments include commitments that have maturities over one year. Contractual purchases include commitments for future cash expenditures, primarily for services and contracts that reflect the minimum contractual obligation under legally enforceable contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. Excluded from the following table are a number of obligations to be settled in cash, primarily in under one year. These obligations are reflected in Salisbury’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and include deposits, FHLBB advances and repurchase agreements that settle within standard market timeframes.
LIQUIDITY
Salisbury manages its liquidity position to ensure it has sufficient funding availability at all times to meet both anticipated and unanticipated deposit withdrawals, loan originations and advances, securities purchases and other operating cash outflows. Salisbury’s primary source of liquidity is deposits and though its preferred funding strategy is to attract and retain low cost deposits, its ability to do so is affected by competitive interest rates and terms in its marketplace, and other financial market conditions. Other sources of funding include cash flows from loan and securities principal payments and maturities, funds provided by operations, and discretionary use of national market certificates of deposit and FHLBB advances. Liquidity can also be provided through sales of securities and loans. Salisbury manages its liquidity in accordance with a liquidity funding policy, and also maintains a contingency funding plan that provides for the prompt and comprehensive response to unexpected demands for liquidity. Management believes Salisbury’s funding sources will meet anticipated funding needs.
Operating activities for 2020 provided net cash of $13.8 million. Investing activities utilized net cash of $114.0 million, principally from purchases of securities of $37.4 million, net loan originations and principal collections of $107.4 million, a $3.5 million investment in BOLI and capital expenditures of $4.4 million, offset by sales, calls, and maturities of securities of $32.5 million, BOLI proceeds of $4.0 million and proceeds from the redemption of FHLB stock of $1.5 million. Financing activities provided net cash of $166.5 million, principally from a net deposit increase of $209.5 million and advances from FHLBB for $16.0 million, partly offset by FHLB advances payments of $54.3 million, and common stock dividends of $3.3 million, and a decrease of $1.4 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase.
Operating activities for 2019 provided net cash of $14.3 million. Investing activities utilized net cash of $23.4 million, principally from purchases of securities of $53.5 million, loan originations and principal collections, net of $19.2 million, a $5.8 million investment in BOLI and capital expenditures of $2.0 million, offset by sales, calls, and maturities of securities of $55.4 million. Financing activities utilized net cash of $22.5 million, principally from the maturity of FHLBB advances of $37.0 million, a net deposit decrease of $7.2 million, and common stock dividends of $3.2 million, partly offset by FHLB advances of $20.5 million and an increase of $4.4 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase.
Operating activities for 2018 provided net cash of $13.3 million. Investing activities utilized net cash of $118.1 million, principally from loan originations and principal collections, net of $102.3 million and purchases of securities of $41.6 million, offset by sales, calls, and maturities of securities of $27.8 million. Financing activities provided net cash of $114.8 million, principally from a net deposit increase of $103.0 million, FHLBB advances of $37.0 million and an increase of $2.4 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase, partly offset by net principal payments on FHLB advances of $24.5 million and common stock dividends of $3.1 million.
CAPITAL RESOURCES
Shareholders’ Equity
Shareholders’ equity increased $11.1 million in 2020 to $124.7 million at December 31, 2020. Contributing to the increase in shareholders’ equity was net income of $11.9 million, a gain in other comprehensive income of $1.7 million and restricted stock awards of $0.7 million to certain of Salisbury’s directors and employees, partially offset by common stock dividends declared of $3.3 million.
Capital Requirements
The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Under current regulatory definitions, the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject and the Bank is considered to be well-capitalized. As a result, the Bank pays lower federal deposit insurance premiums than those banks that are not “well capitalized.” Requirements for classification as a well-capitalized institution and for minimum capital adequacy along with the Bank's regulatory capital ratios are as follows at December 31, 2020 and 2019 under the regulatory capital rules then in effect:
Excluding average PPP loan balances of $62.0 million, the Bank’s Tier 1 Capital (to average assets) ratio would have been approximately 9.35% at December 31, 2020.
A well-capitalized institution, which is the highest capital category for an institution as defined by the Prompt Corrective Action regulations issued by the FDIC and the FRB, is one which maintains a Total Risk-Based ratio of 10% or above, a Tier 1 Risk-Based ratio of 8% or above, a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or above, and a Leverage ratio of 5% or above, and is not subject to any written order, written agreement, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level. Maintaining strong capital is essential to Salisbury and the Bank’s safety and soundness. However, the effective management of capital resources requires generating attractive returns on equity to build value for shareholders while maintaining appropriate levels of capital to fund growth, meet regulatory requirements and be consistent with prudent industry practices.
The FRB’s final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s capital guidelines for bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries include a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 4.5%, a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.0%, require a minimum ratio of Total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, and require a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. A capital conservation buffer, comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital, is also established above the regulatory minimum capital requirements. This capital conservation buffer began phasing in January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increased each subsequent year by an additional 0.625% until it reached its final level of 2.50% on January 1, 2019. Strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments were also implemented under the final rules.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company and the Bank met each of their capital requirements and the most recent notification from the FDIC categorized the Bank as “well-capitalized.” There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank’s category.
On September 17, 2019, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the FRB and the FDIC published its final rule establishing a “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” (“CBLR”) that simplifies capital requirements for certain community banking organizations with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets (such as the Bank). Under the final rule, depository institutions and their holding companies that meet certain criteria (generally, those with limited amounts of off-balance sheet exposures, trading assets and liabilities, mortgage servicing assets, and temporary difference deferred tax assets) (“qualifying community banking organizations”) may elect to report the components of its Tier 1 leverage ratio as a measure of capital adequacy. A qualifying community banking organization with a CBLR of greater than 9% that “elects to use the CBLR framework” will not be subject to other risk-based and leverage capital requirements and will be considered to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements for purposes of the agencies’ Prompt Corrective Action (“PCA”) framework. Under the final rule, if a bank that has opted to use the CBLR framework subsequently fails to satisfy one or more of the qualifying criteria, but continues to report a leverage ratio of greater than 8 %, the bank may continue to use the framework and will be deemed “well capitalized” for a grace period of up to two quarters. A qualifying community banking organization will be required to comply with the generally applicable capital rule and file the relevant regulatory reports if the banking organization: (1) is unable to restore compliance with all qualifying criteria during the two-quarter grace period( including achieving compliance with the greater than 9% leverage ratio requirement); (2) reports a leverage ratio of 8% or less; or (3) ceases to satisfy the qualifying criteria due to consummation of a merger transaction. The final rule became effective on January 1, 2020. The Bank would qualify for the CBLR methodology and would also be considered to be well capitalized if it elected to utilize such methodology. The Bank is currently evaluating the benefits of transitioning to this simplified methodology for assessing capital adequacy.
On April 6, 2020, the regulators announced that the CBLR will be modified so that: (1) beginning in the second quarter 2020 and until the end of the year, a banking organization that has a leverage ratio of 8% or greater and meets certain other criteria may elect to use the CBLR framework; and (2) community banks will have until January 1, 2022 before the CBLR requirement is re-established at greater than 9%. Under the interim final rules, the CBLR will be 8% beginning in the second quarter 2020 and for the remainder of the calendar year, 8.5% for calendar year 2021 and 9% thereafter. The Bank is currently evaluating the benefits of transitioning to this simplified methodology for assessing capital adequacy.
Dividends
In January 2020, the Board of Directors of Salisbury Bank approved a $0.01 increase in the quarterly dividend. During 2020 and 2019, Salisbury declared and paid four quarterly common stock dividends of $0.29 and $0.28 per common share each quarter, respectively, totaling $3.3 million and $3.2 million, respectively. The Board of Directors of Salisbury declared a common stock dividend of $0.29 per common share payable on February 26, 2021 to shareholders of record on February 12, 2021. Common stock dividends, when declared, will generally be paid the last business day of February, May, August and November, although Salisbury is not obligated to pay dividends on those dates or at any other time.
Salisbury's ability to pay cash dividends is dependent on the Bank's ability to pay cash dividends to Salisbury. There are certain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends and other payments by the Bank to Salisbury. Under Connecticut law, the Bank cannot declare a cash dividend except from net profits, defined as the remainder of all earnings from current operations. The total of all cash dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year shall not, unless specifically approved by the Banking Commissioner, exceed the total of its net profits of that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years.
FRB Supervisory Letter SR 09-4, February 24, 2009, revised March 30, 2009, states that, as a general matter, the Board of Directors of a Bank Holding Company (“BHC”) should inform the Federal Reserve and should eliminate, defer, or significantly reduce dividends if (1) net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (2) the prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (3) the BHC will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. Moreover, a BHC should inform the Federal Reserve reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period (e.g., quarter) for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the BHC capital position.
Salisbury believes that the payment of common stock cash dividends is appropriate, provided that such payment considers Salisbury's capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition and does not adversely affect the financial stability of Salisbury or the Bank. The continued payment of common stock cash dividends by Salisbury will be dependent on Salisbury's future core earnings, financial condition and capital needs, regulatory restrictions, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors of Salisbury.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on Salisbury’s consolidated financial statements.
IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES
Salisbury’s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto presented elsewhere in this Form 10-K are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which require the measurement of financial condition and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money, over time, due to inflation. Unlike some other types of companies, the financial nature of Salisbury’s consolidated financial statements is more clearly affected by changes in interest rates than by inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily fluctuate in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. However, inflation does affect Salisbury to some extent because, as prices increase, the money supply grows and interest rates are affected by inflationary expectations. There is no precise method, however, to measure the effects of inflation on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, any examination or analysis of the financial statements should take into consideration the possible effects of inflation. Although not a material factor in recent years, inflation could impact earnings in future periods.
