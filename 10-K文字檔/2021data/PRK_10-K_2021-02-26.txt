NON-U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Management's discussion and analysis contains non-U.S. GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding Park’s results of operations or financial position. Where non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, can be found herein.
Items Impacting Comparability of Period Results
From time to time, revenue, expenses, and/or taxes are impacted by items judged by management of Park to be outside of ordinary banking activities and/or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by management of Park at that time to be infrequent or short-term in nature. Most often, these items impacting comparability of period results are due to merger and acquisition activities, management restructuring, branch closures, a rebranding initiative, COVID-19 related expenses and revenue and expenses related to former Vision Bank loan relationships. In other cases, they may result from management's decisions associated with significant corporate actions outside of the ordinary course of business.
Even though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions, as a general rule volatility alone does not result in the inclusion of an item as one
impacting comparability of period results. For example, changes in the provision for loan losses (aside from those related to former Vision Bank loan relationships), gains (losses) on equity securities, and asset valuation writedowns, reflect ordinary banking activities and are, therefore, typically excluded from consideration as items impacting comparability of period results.
Management believes the disclosure of items impacting comparability of period results provides a better understanding of our performance and trends and allows management to ascertain which of such items, if any, to include or exclude from an analysis of our performance; i.e., within the context of determining how that performance differed from expectations, as well as how, if at all, to adjust estimates of future performance taking such items into account.
Items impacting comparability of the results of particular periods are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performance.
Non-U.S. GAAP Ratios
Park's management uses certain non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to evaluate Park's performance. Specifically, management reviews the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets.
Management has included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation, information relating to the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets. For the purpose of calculating the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, tangible equity is divided by tangible assets. Tangible equity equals total shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangible assets, in each case at period end. Tangible assets equals total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets, in each case at period end.
Management believes that the disclosure of the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets presents additional information to the reader of the consolidated financial statements, which, when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, assists in analyzing Park's operating performance, ensures comparability of operating performance from period to period, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of Park's peer financial holding companies and bank holding companies, while eliminating certain non-operational effects of acquisitions. Within the "CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS - Capital" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Park has provided detail of the reconciliation of tangible equity to total shareholders' equity and of tangible assets to total assets solely for the purpose of complying with SEC Regulation G and not as an indication that the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets is a substitute for the ratio of total shareholders' equity to total assets as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
FTE (fully taxable equivalent) Ratios
Interest income, yields, and ratios on a FTE basis are considered non-U.S. GAAP financial measures. Management believes net interest income on a FTE basis provides a clearer picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes. The FTE basis also allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The FTE basis assumes a federal statutory tax rate of 21%. In the tables included within the "ANALYSIS OF EARNINGS - Net Interest Income" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Park has provided detail of FTE interest income solely for the purpose of complying with SEC Regulation G and not as an indication that FTE interest income, yields and ratios are substitutes for interest income, yields and ratios, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") Loans
Park originated $543.1 million in loans as part of the PPP. These loans are not typical of Park's loan portfolio in that they are part of a specific government program to support businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic and are 100% guaranteed by the Small Business Administration ("SBA"). As such, management considers growth in the loan portfolio excluding PPP loans, the total allowance for loan losses on originated loans to total originated loans ratio (excluding PPP loans), and general reserve as a % of total originated loans (excluding acquisitions) less impaired commercial loans (excluding PPP loans) in addition to the related U.S. GAAP metrics which are not adjusted for PPP loans.
OVERVIEW
COVID-19 Considerations
Banking has been identified by federal and state governmental authorities to be an essential service and Park is fully
committed to continue serving our customers and communities through the COVID-19 public health crisis. For those in our communities experiencing a financial hardship, Park has offered various methods of support including loan modifications, payment deferral programs, participation in the PPP, planned participation in additional PPP loans authorized under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, and various other case by case accommodations. Park has implemented various physical distancing guidelines to help protect associates, such as allowing associates to work from home, where practical, while maintaining customer service via our online banking services, mobile app, and ATMs, by keeping drive-thru lanes open to serve customers, maintaining selective open branch offices, and offering other banking services by appointment when necessary.
During 2020, Park provided calamity pay and special one-time bonuses to certain associates. The cost of the calamity pay and special bonuses amounted to $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and is included within salaries expense.
Paycheck Protection Program
Through December 31, 2020, Park had approved and funded 4,439 loans totaling $543.1 million under the PPP. These PPP loans had an average principal balance of $122,000. Of the $543.1 million in PPP loans, 21 loans totaling $68.2 million had a principal balance that was greater than $2 million. For its assistance in making and retaining the 4,439 loans, Park has received an aggregate of $20.2 million in fees from the SBA, of which $13.7 million were recognized within loan interest income during the year ended December 31, 2020. Park funded the PPP loans with excess on-balance sheet liquidity. At December 31, 2020, the remaining balance of PPP loans was $337.1 million.
As of January 31, 2021, Park has submitted approximately 2,656 repayment requests on behalf of borrowers under the PPP to the SBA and has received $260.4 million in payments from the SBA.
During 2021, Park plans to offer additional PPP loans as authorized under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, signed into law on December 27, 2020. As of February 22, 2021, 1,795 applications had been submitted to the SBA related to these additional PPP loans.
Loan Modifications
During the year ended December 31, 2020, Park modified 5,005 consumer loans, with an aggregate balance of $103.5 million, and modified 1,399 commercial loans, with an aggregate balance of $563.7 million, in each case related to a hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and responses thereto. Park worked with borrowers and provided modifications in the form of either interest only deferral or principal and interest deferral, in each case, for initial periods of up to 90 days. As necessary, Park made available a second 90-day interest only deferral or principal and interest deferral bringing the total potential deferral period to six months. Modifications are structured in a manner to best address each individual customer's current situation. A majority of these modifications are excluded from TDR classification under Section 4013 of the CARES Act or under applicable interagency guidance of the federal banking regulators. Modified loans will be considered current and will continue to accrue interest during the deferral period.
Detail of COVID-19 modifications within Park's loan portfolios during the year ended December 31, 2020 follows:
Of the $667.3 million of COVID-19 modifications during the year ended December 31, 2020, $10.1 million were
greater than 30 days past due in accordance with the modified terms at December 31, 2020.
Detail of COVID-19 modifications on selected commercial loan portfolios during the year ended December 31, 2020 follows:
Many of the initial interest only deferrals or principal and interest deferrals were for an initial period of three months. Park has received requests for additional deferrals. Loans which have had multiple COVID-19 modifications through December 31, 2020 are detailed below.
(1) -Credit Quality Indicators: When determining the quarterly and annual loan loss provision, Park reviews the grades of commercial loans. These loans are graded from 1 to 8. A grade of 1 indicates little or no credit risk and a grade of 8 is considered a loss. Commercial loans that are pass-rated (1 through 4) are considered to be of acceptable credit risk. Commercial loans graded a 5 (special mention) are considered to be watch list credits and a higher loan loss reserve percentage is allocated to these loans. Commercial loans graded a 6 (substandard), also considered watch list credits, are considered to represent higher credit risk and, as a result, a higher loan loss reserve percentage is allocated to these loans. Generally, commercial loans that are graded a 6 are considered for partial charge-off or have been charged down to the net realizable value of the underlying collateral. Commercial loans graded a 7 (doubtful) are shown as nonperforming and Park charges these loans down to their fair value by taking a partial charge-off or recording a specific reserve. Any commercial loan graded an 8 (loss) is completely charged off.
Park considers a loan out of deferral when the first regular payment is due and that payment is subsequently made. The table below details the status of loans with COVID-19 deferrals as of December 31, 2020.
Financial Results by segment
The following table reflects the net income (loss) by segment for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Park's segments include The Park National Bank ("PNB"), Guardian Financial Services Company ("GFSC") and "All Other" which primarily consists of Park as the "Parent Company" and SE Property Holdings, LLC ("SEPH"). SEPH is a non-bank subsidiary of Park, holding former Vision Bank OREO property and non-performing loans.
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $127.9 million represented a $25.2 million, or 24.6%, increase compared to $102.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net income for both the year ended December 31, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2019 included several items of income and expense that impact the comparability of period results. These items are detailed in the "ANALYSIS OF EARNINGS - Items Impacting Comparability" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion provides additional information regarding Park's two operating segments, followed by additional information regarding All Other, which consists of the Parent Company and SEPH.
The Park National Bank (PNB)
The table below reflects PNB's net income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Net interest income of $326.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 represented a $33.2 million, or 11.3%, increase compared to $293.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was a result of a $35.0 million decrease in interest expense, partially offset by a $1.8 million decrease in interest income.
The $1.8 million decrease in interest income was primarily due to a $10.2 million decrease in investment income, partially offset by an $8.4 million increase in interest income on loans. The decrease in investment income was partially the result of a $213.1 million decrease in average investments from $1.35 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.14 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in investment income was also the result of a decrease in the average yield on investments, which decreased 10 basis points to 2.66% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2.76% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in interest income on loans was partially the result of a $786.0 million increase in average loans from $6.19 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, to $6.97 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in average loans was impacted by the addition of average PPP loans of approximately $352.6 million which also resulted in interest and fee income of $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in average loans was partially offset by the decrease in the average yield on loans, which decreased 46 basis points to 4.66% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 5.12% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Excluding the impact of PPP loan interest and fee income, the average yield on loans was 4.66%, a decrease of 46 basis points, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 5.12% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest income was impacted by the acquisition of CAB Financial Corporation, the parent of Carolina Alliance Bank ("Carolina Alliance") on April 1, 2019. The Carolina Alliance Division contributed an aggregate of $30.6 million to interest income at PNB during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The $35.0 million decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a $29.5 million decrease in interest expense on deposits as well as a $5.5 million decrease in interest expense on borrowings. The decrease in interest expense on deposits was the result of a decrease in the average cost of deposits of 60 basis points from 1.01% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 0.41% for the year ended December 31, 2020. This was partially offset by a $209.1 million increase in average interest-bearing deposits from $5.03 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, to $5.24 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in interest expense on borrowings was partially the result of a $129.2 million decrease in average borrowings from $533.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to $403.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The average cost of borrowings also decreased by 69 basis points, from 2.10% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 1.41% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest expense was impacted by the acquisition of Carolina Alliance. The Carolina Alliance Division contributed an aggregate of $2.8 million to interest expense at PNB during the year ended December 31, 2020 and $4.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.
The provision for loan losses of $30.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 represented an increase of $22.5 million, compared to $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Refer to the “CREDIT EXPERIENCE - Provision for Loan Losses" section for additional details regarding the level of the provision for loan losses recognized in each period presented above.
Other income of $124.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 represented an increase of $31.8 million, or 34.5%, compared to $92.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $31.8 million increase was primarily related to a $21.6 million increase in other service income, which was primarily due to an increase in fee income from mortgage loan originations and investor rate locks; a $3.7 million increase in gain on sale of debt securities; a $3.2 million increase in other components of net periodic benefit income; a $1.9 million increase in debit card fee income; a $1.6 million increase in income
from partnership investments; a $1.1 million increase in income from fiduciary activities; and a $946,000 increase in gain (loss) on sale of OREO, net. These increases were partially offset by a $2.4 million decrease in service charges on deposits. Other income was impacted by the acquisition of Carolina Alliance. The Carolina Alliance Division contributed an aggregate of $8.8 million to other income at PNB during the year ended December 31, 2020 and $3.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.
A summary of mortgage loan originations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 follows. Of total mortgage loan originations shown below for 2020, refinances comprised 48.1% in the first quarter of 2020, 67.8% in the second quarter of 2020, 68.5% in the third quarter of 2020, 71.4% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 66.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Of total mortgage loan originations shown below for 2019, refinances comprised 32.5% in the first quarter of 2019, 29.7% in the second quarter of 2019, 41.3% in the third quarter of 2019, 47.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 39.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The table below reflects PNB's other expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Other expense of $268.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 represented an increase of $31.5 million, or 13.3%, compared to $237.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in salaries expense was primarily related to increases in base salary expense, severance related expenses, additional compensation incentives, including COVID-19 special one-time bonuses, vacation accruals and officer incentive compensation expense. The increase in employee benefits expense was primarily related to increased pension plan expense and defined contribution plan expense, partially offset by a decrease in group insurance costs.
The increase in occupancy expense was primarily the result of increased depreciation on premises and a write-down in the right-of-use lease asset related to branches that closed September 30, 2020. The increase in furniture and equipment expense was primarily related to increased expenses related to repairs and maintenance on equipment, which also included software maintenance and costs, as well as increased depreciation on furniture and equipment. The increase in data processing fees was related to increased mortgage processing costs, debit card processing costs and other data processing and software costs. The increase in professional fees and services was primarily related to increased title, appraisal and credit costs, increases in management and consulting fees and increases in other fees, partially offset by a $205,000 decrease in temporary wage expense. The increase in insurance expense was primarily due to a $2.2 million assessment credit which had been utilized for the FDIC expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 (and not repeated in 2020), as well as an increase in the assessment base for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period of 2019. The decrease in communications expense was primarily related to a change in statement mailing and production costs, which resulted in lower direct postage expense, but is more than offset by an increase in supply expense which is included in miscellaneous expense. The increase in the FHLB prepayment penalty was due to a $10.5 prepayment penalty on FHLB borrowings of $150 million repaid during the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in foundation contributions expense was due to a $3.0 million contribution during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in miscellaneous expense was primarily related to a decrease in training and travel related expenses as well as decreased non loan related losses.
Other expense was impacted by the acquisition of Carolina Alliance. Of the $268.9 million of total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Carolina Alliance Division's total other expense was $19.4 million. Of the $237.4 million of total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, the Carolina Alliance Division's total other expense was $16.5 million.
The table below reflects PNB's other expense less the impact of the Carolina Alliance Division for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Loans outstanding at December 31, 2020 were $7.17 billion, compared to $6.48 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $684.2 million, or 10.6%. Excluding the $337.1 million of PPP loans remaining at December 31, 2020, loans
outstanding were $6.83 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $6.48 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $347.1 million, or 5.4%. The table below breaks out the change in loans outstanding, by loan type.
PNB's allowance for loan losses increased by $29.6 million, or 54.2%, to $84.3 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $54.7 million at December 31, 2019. Net charge-offs were $1.2 million, or 0.02% of total average loans, for the year ended December 31, 2020 and were $2.7 million, or 0.04% of total average loans, for the year ended December 31, 2019. Refer to the “CREDIT EXPERIENCE - Provision for Loan Losses" section for additional information regarding PNB's loan portfolio and the level of provision for loan losses recognized in each period presented.
Total deposits at December 31, 2020 were $7.82 billion, compared to $7.13 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $695.9 million, or 9.8%. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Park made the decision to participate in a one-way sell (OWS) program in order to manage the balance sheet. At December 31, 2020, Park had $710.1 million in OWS insured cash sweep deposits which were off-balance sheet. Total deposits would have increased $1.4 billion, or 19.7%, compared to December 31, 2019 had the $710.1 million remained on the balance sheet. The table below breaks out the change in deposit balances, by deposit type.

All Other
The table below summarizes the All Other net income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.
The net interest (expense) income for All Other included, for all periods presented, interest income on subordinated debt investments in PNB, which were eliminated in the consolidated Park National Corporation totals, as well as interest income on SEPH impaired loan relationships. The net interest (expense) income for All Other included for year ended December 31, 2020, interest expense on $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2030 issued in August 2020.
Net interest (expense) income reflected net interest expense of $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net interest expense of $406,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was largely the result of an increase in borrowing interest expense, partially offset by an increase in loan interest income related to payment collections at SEPH.
SEPH had net recoveries of $19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net recoveries of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
All Other had other income of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to other income of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was largely due to a $4.0 million decrease in income related to partnership investments, which went from a $3.9 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2019 to a $21,000 loss for the year ended December 31, 2020, and a $486,000 decrease in gain (loss) on equity securities, net, which went from a $261,000 gain for the year ended December 31, 2019 to a $226,000 loss for the year ended December 31, 2020.
All Other had other expense of $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was largely due to an $8.2 million decrease in merger related expenses related to the NewDominion and Carolina Alliance acquisitions.
Park National Corporation
The table below summarizes Park's net income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.
DIVIDENDS ON COMMON SHARES
Cash dividends declared on Park's common shares were $4.28 in 2020, $4.24 in 2019 and $4.07 in 2018.

BUSINESS" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The significant accounting policies used in the development and presentation of Park’s consolidated financial statements are listed in "Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA." The accounting and reporting policies of Park conform with U.S. GAAP and general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant unprecedented disruption around the world that has affected daily living and negatively impacted the global economy. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may meaningfully impact significant estimates such as the allowance for loan losses, goodwill, and pension plan obligations and related expenses.
ALLL - The determination of the ALLL involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than Park's other significant accounting policies. The ALLL is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb probable, incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio. Management’s determination of the adequacy of the ALLL is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and of current economic conditions. However, this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates, including expected default probabilities, the loss given default, the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, and estimated losses based on historical loss experience and current economic conditions. All of these factors may be susceptible to significant change. To the extent that actual results differ from management estimates, additional loan loss provisions may be required that would adversely impact earnings for future periods.
Fair Value - In accordance with U.S. GAAP, management utilizes the fair value hierarchy, which has the objective of maximizing the use of observable market inputs. The accounting guidance also requires disclosures regarding the inputs used to calculate fair value. These inputs are classified as Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. Level 3 inputs are those with significant
unobservable inputs that reflect a company’s own assumptions about the market for a particular instrument. Some of the inputs could be based on internal models and/or cash flow analyses. The large majority of Park’s financial assets valued using Level 2 inputs consist of AFS debt securities. The fair value of these AFS debt securities is obtained largely by the use of matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the financial services industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted securities.
Goodwill and other intangible assets - The accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets also involves a higher degree of judgment than most other significant accounting policies. U.S. GAAP establishes standards for the impairment assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets represents the excess of the purchase price over net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination. Park’s goodwill relates to the value inherent in the banking industry and that value is dependent upon the ability of PNB, Park’s national bank subsidiary, to provide quality, cost-effective banking services in a competitive marketplace. The goodwill value is supported by revenue that is in part driven by the volume of business transacted. A decrease in earnings resulting from a decline in the customer base, the inability to deliver cost-effective services over sustained periods or significant credit problems can lead to impairment of goodwill that could adversely impact earnings in future periods.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized to expense, but are subject to impairment tests annually, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired, by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If after assessing these events or circumstances, it is concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing additional analysis is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge must be recorded in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the total goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. At December 31, 2020, on a consolidated basis, Park had $159.6 million of goodwill and $9.3 million of other intangibles, all of which are recorded at PNB.
Pension Plan - The determination of pension plan obligations and related expenses requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees will earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension expense is principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the liability due to the passage of time (interest cost), and (3) other gains and losses, reduced by (4) the expected return on plan assets for our pension plan.
Significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension expense include:
•the interest rate used to determine the present value of liabilities (discount rate);
•certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality;
•the expected return on assets in our funded plan; and
•the rate of salary increases where benefits are based on earnings.
Our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations. Due to the significant management judgment involved, our assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension plan expense and obligation.
ABOUT OUR BUSINESS
Through our national bank subsidiary, PNB, Park is engaged in a general commercial banking and trust business, primarily in Ohio, Kentucky, North Carolina and South Carolina, with the exception of nationwide aircraft loans and nationwide asset-based lending to consumer finance companies. Management believes there are a significant number of consumers and businesses that seek long-term relationships with community-based financial institutions of quality and strength. While not engaging in activities such as foreign lending, nationally syndicated loans or investment banking, Park attempts to meet the needs of our customers for commercial, real estate and consumer loans, and investment, fiduciary and deposit services.
Park’s subsidiaries compete for deposits and loans with other banks, savings associations, credit unions and other types of financial institutions. At December 31, 2020, Park operated 101 financial service offices (including those of PNB, Scope Leasing, Inc. ("Scope Aircraft Finance"), and GFSC) and a network of 117 automated teller machines in 26 Ohio counties, one Kentucky county, three North Carolina counties and four South Carolina counties. SEPH also operated one office, located in Newark, Ohio.
SOURCE OF FUNDS
Deposits: Park’s major source of funds is deposits from individuals, businesses and local government entities. These deposits consist of non-interest bearing and interest bearing deposits.
Average total deposits were $7,633 million in 2020, compared to $6,905 million in 2019, and $6,135 million in 2018. Table 17 provides a summary of deposit balances as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, along with the change over the past year.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, Park made the decision to participate in a one-way sell (OWS) program in order to manage the balance sheet. At December 31, 2020, Park had $710.1 million in OWS insured cash sweep deposits which were off-balance sheet. Total deposits would have increased $1.2 billion, or 17.4%, compared to December 31, 2019 had the $710.1 million remained on the balance sheet.
The average interest rate paid on interest bearing deposits was 0.41% in 2020, compared to 1.01% in 2019, and 0.72% in 2018. The average cost of interest bearing deposits for each quarter of 2020 was 0.19% for the fourth quarter, 0.26% for the third quarter, 0.36% for the second quarter and 0.81% for the first quarter.
Maturities of time deposits in amounts of $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were:
Short-Term Borrowings: Short-term borrowings consist of securities sold under agreements to repurchase, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, Federal Funds purchased and other borrowings. These funds are used to manage the Corporation’s liquidity needs and interest rate sensitivity risk. The average rate paid on short-term borrowings generally moves closely with changes in market interest rates for short-term investments. The average rate paid on short-term borrowings was 0.40% in 2020, compared to 1.15% in 2019, and 0.74% in 2018. The year-end balance for short-term borrowings was $342 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $231 million at December 31, 2019, and $222 million at December 31, 2018.
Long-Term Debt: Long-term debt primarily consists of borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank and a term note with another financial institution. The average balance of long-term debt and the average cost of long-term debt include the subordinated notes discussed in the following section. In 2020, the average balance of long-term debt was $216 million, compared to $341 million in 2019 and $424 million in 2018. The average interest rate paid on long-term debt was 3.55% in 2020, compared to 2.77% in 2019, and 2.38% for 2018. Average total debt (long-term and short-term) was $495 million in 2020, compared to $557 million in 2019, and $642 million in 2018. Average total debt decreased by $62 million, or 11.1%, in 2020 compared to 2019, and decreased by $85 million, or 13.2%, in 2019 compared to 2018. Average long-term debt was 44% of average total debt in 2020, compared to 61% of average total debt in 2019, and 66% of average total debt in 2018.
Subordinated Notes: Park assumed, with the 2007 acquisition of Vision's parent holding company, $15.5 million of floating rate junior subordinated notes. The $15.5 million of junior subordinated notes were purchased by Vision Bancshares
Trust I ("Trust I") following the issuance of Trust I's $15.0 million of floating rate preferred securities. The interest rate on these junior subordinated notes adjusts every quarter at 148 basis points above the three-month LIBOR interest rate. The maturity date for the junior subordinated notes is December 30, 2035 and the junior subordinated notes may be prepaid, without penalty, after December 30, 2010. These junior subordinated notes qualify as Tier 1 capital under current Federal Reserve Board guidelines.
On August 20, 2020, Park completed the issuance and sale of $175 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.50% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2030, (the "Subordinated Notes"). The Subordinated Notes initially bear a fixed interest rate of 4.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on March 1, 2021. Commencing on September 1, 2025, the Subordinated Notes will bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to the Benchmark rate, which is expected to be Three-Month Term SOFR, plus a spread of 439 basis points for each quarterly interest period during the floating rate period, payable quarterly in arrears; provided, however, that if the Benchmark rate is less than zero, then the Benchmark rate will be deemed to be zero. The Company may, at its option, beginning with the interest payment date of September 1, 2025 and on any interest payment date thereafter, redeem the Subordinated Notes, in whole or in part, from time to time, subject to obtaining the prior approval of the holders of the Company’s senior indebtedness and of the Federal Reserve Board to the extent the approval of the Federal Reserve Board is then required under the capital adequacy rules of the Federal Reserve Board, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Subordinated Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to but excluding the date of redemption. The Subordinated Notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for Park under the Federal Reserve Board's capital adequacy rules.
See "Note 17 - Subordinated Notes" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about the Subordinated Notes.
Shareholders' Equity: The ratio of total shareholders' equity to total assets was 11.21% at December 31, 2020, compared to 11.32% at December 31, 2019, and 10.67% at December 31, 2018. The ratio of tangible shareholders’ equity [shareholders' equity ($1,040.3 million) less goodwill ($159.6 million) and other intangible assets ($9.3 million)] to tangible assets [total assets ($9,279 million) less goodwill ($159.6 million) and other intangible assets ($9.3 million)] was 9.57% at December 31, 2020, compared to 9.51% at December 31, 2019, and 9.28% at December 31, 2018.
In accordance with U.S. GAAP, Park reflects any unrealized holding gain or loss on AFS debt securities, any unrealized net holding gain or loss on cash flow hedging derivatives and any change in the funded status of Park's pension plan, net of income taxes, as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) which is part of Park’s shareholders’ equity.
The unrealized net holding gain, net of income taxes, on AFS debt securities was $40.7 million at year-end 2020, compared to $17.5 million at year-end 2019, and to the unrealized net holding loss, net of income taxes, of $20.1 million at year-end 2018.
The unrealized net holding loss, net of income taxes, on cash flow hedging derivatives was $698,000 at year-end 2020, compared to $454,000 at year-end 2019. There were no cash flow hedging derivatives at year-end 2018.
In accordance with U.S. GAAP, Park adjusts accumulated other comprehensive income to recognize the net actuarial gain or loss reflected in the funding status of Park’s pension plan. See "Note 20 - Benefit Plans" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on the accounting for Park’s pension plan. Pertaining to the funding status of the pension plan, Park recognized a net comprehensive loss of $7.7 million in 2020, a net comprehensive gain of $3.0 million in 2019, and a net comprehensive loss of $3.0 million in 2018. The net comprehensive loss in 2020 was due to changes in actuarial assumptions which were partially offset by increased investment returns on pension plan assets. The net comprehensive gain in 2019 was due to changes in actuarial assumptions being more than offset by increased investment returns on pension plan assets. The net comprehensive loss in 2018 was due to changes in actuarial assumptions being more than offset by lower than projected returns on pension plan assets during 2018.
At year-end 2020, the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss pertaining to the pension plan was $34.4 million, compared to $26.7 million at December 31, 2019, and $29.7 million at December 31, 2018.
INVESTMENT OF FUNDS
Loans: Average loans were $6,990 million in 2020, compared to $6,208 million in 2019, and $5,461 million in 2018. The average yield on average loan balances was 4.71% in 2020, compared to 5.19% in 2019, and 4.98% in 2018.
Approximately 48% of Park’s loan balances mature or reprice within one year (see Table 41). The average yield on average loan balances for each quarter of 2020 was 4.69% for the fourth quarter, 4.54% for the third quarter, 4.63% for the second quarter and 5.02% for the first quarter.
Loan interest income for 2020, 2019, and 2018 included $453,000, $256,000, and $3.4 million, respectively, related to payments received on certain SEPH impaired loan relationships, some of which are participated with PNB. In addition, loan interest income included $4.4 million, $5.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of the accretion of loan purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisitions of NewDominion and Carolina Alliance. Loan interest income for 2020 included interest and fee income related to PPP loans of $16.7 million. Excluding this income, the average yield on loans was 4.63%, 5.09%, and 4.89%, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018. Excluding this income, the average yield on loans was 4.48% for the fourth quarter of 2020, 4.54% for the third quarter of 2020, 4.58% for the second quarter of 2020, and 4.92% for the first quarter of 2020.
At December 31, 2020, loan balances were $7,178 million, compared to $6,501 million at year-end 2019, an increase of $676 million, or 10.4%. Excluding $337.1 million of PPP loans at December 31, 2020, loans outstanding at December 31, 2020 were $6,841 million, compared to $6,501 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $340 million, or 5.2%.
Table 19 reports year-end loan balances by type of loan for the past five years.
On a combined basis, year-end commercial, financial and agricultural loans, construction real estate loans and commercial real estate loans increased by $554 million, or 17.7%, in 2020. The increase in 2020 was due to an increase in commercial real estate loans of $138.8 million, an increase in construction real estate loans of $11.7 million and an increase in commercial, financial and agricultural loans of $403.9 million. Included within commercial, financial and agricultural loans are $337.1 million of PPP loans. On a combined basis, year-end commercial, financial and agricultural loans, construction real estate loans and commercial real estate loans increased by $522 million, or 20.0%, in 2019. The increase in 2019 was due to an increase in commercial real estate loans of $326.4 million, an increase in commercial, financial and agricultural loans of $112.3 million and an increase in construction real estate loans of $83.4 million.
Consumer loans increased by $207.3 million, or 14.3%, in 2020 and increased $160.2 million, or 12.4%, in 2019. The increase in consumer loans in each of 2020 and 2019 was primarily due to an increase in automobile lending in Ohio.
Residential real estate loans decreased by $79.7 million, or 4.2%, in 2020 and increased by $99.1 million, or 5.5%, in 2019. The decrease in 2020 was due to a decrease in mortgage loans secured by residential real estate of $80.0 million, a decrease in home equity loans secured by residential real estate of $42.7 million and a decrease in installment loans secured by residential real estate of $4.1 million, partially offset by an increase in commercial loans secured by residential real estate of $47.1 million.
Leases decreased by $5.6 million to $24.4 million in 2020 and increased by $27.8 million in 2019 to $30.1 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $2.3 million as of December 31, 2018. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to the acquisition of Carolina Alliance.
Table 20 summarizes the distribution of maturities for all selected loan segments.
(1) Nonaccrual loans of $93.8 million are included within the one year or less classification above.
(2) Purchase accounting discounts of $5.6 million are included within the one year or less classification above.
Investment Securities: Park’s investment securities portfolio is structured to minimize credit risk, provide liquidity and contribute to earnings. As conditions change over time, Park’s overall interest rate risk, liquidity needs and potential return on the investment portfolio will change. Management regularly evaluates the securities in the investment portfolio as circumstances evolve. Circumstances that could result in the sale of a security include: to better manage interest rate risk; to meet liquidity needs; or to improve the overall yield in the investment portfolio.
AFS debt securities are carried on the books at their estimated fair value with the unrealized holding gain or loss, net of income taxes, accounted for as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The debt securities that are classified as AFS are free to be sold in future periods in carrying out Park’s investment strategies.
Prior to September 1, 2019, Park classified certain types of U.S. Government sponsored entity collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) and tax-exempt municipal securities that it purchased as Held-To-Maturity ("HTM"). These debt securities had been classified as HTM because they were generally not as liquid as the investment securities that Park classified as AFS. A classification of HTM meant that Park had the positive intent and the ability to hold these securities until maturity.
On September 1, 2019, Park adopted the portion of ASU 2019-04 which allowed for a one-time reclassification of securities from HTM to AFS. On this date, Park transferred HTM securities with a fair value of $373.9 million to the AFS classification. The transfer occurred at fair value and had a related unrealized gain, net of taxes, of $19.1 million recorded in other comprehensive income. At year-end 2018, Park’s HTM securities portfolio was $352 million. All of the CMOs, mortgage-backed securities, and callable notes in Park’s investment portfolio were issued by U.S. Government sponsored entities.
Average taxable debt investment securities were $858 million in 2020, compared to $1,052 million in 2019 and $1,192 million in 2018. The average yield on taxable debt investment securities was 2.31% in 2020, compared to 2.49% in 2019 and compared to 2.47% in 2018. Average tax-exempt debt investment securities were $289 million in 2020, compared to $309 million in 2019 and $302 million in 2018. The average tax-equivalent yield on tax-exempt debt investment securities was 3.69% in 2020, compared to 3.67% in both 2019 and 2018.
Total debt securities (at amortized cost) were $1,008 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $1,187 million at December 31, 2019 and $1,381 million at December 31, 2018. Management purchased debt securities totaling $354 million in 2020 and $380 million in 2018. There were no purchases of debt securities in 2019. Proceeds from repayments, redemptions and maturities of debt securities were $224 million in 2020, compared to $196 million in 2019 and $208 million in 2018.
During 2020, Park sold certain AFS debt securities with a book value of $112.5 million at a gross loss of $64,000, and sold certain AFS debt securities with a book value of $196.4 million at a gross gain of $3.4 million. During 2019, Park sold certain AFS debt investment securities with a book value of $62.4 million at a gross loss of $692,000, and sold certain AFS debt investment securities with a book value of $29.1 million at a gross gain of $271,000. During 2018, Park sold certain AFS debt investment securities with a book value of $245.0 million at a gross loss of $2.6 million, sold certain AFS debt securities with a book value of $2.0 million at a gross gain of $60,000, and sold certain HTM debt securities with a book value of $7.4
million at a gross gain of $0.3 million. These HTM securities had been paid down by 96.3% of the principal outstanding at acquisition.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the average tax-equivalent yield on the total investment portfolio was 2.66%, 2.76% and 2.72%, respectively. The weighted average remaining maturity of the total investment portfolio was 3.5 years at December 31, 2020, 4.2 years at December 31, 2019 and 4.7 years at December 31, 2018. Obligations of the U.S. Treasury and other U.S. Government sponsored entities and U.S. Government sponsored entities' asset-backed securities were approximately 66.9% of the total investment portfolio at year-end 2020, 69.5% of the total investment portfolio at year-end 2019 and 73.5% of the total investment portfolio at year-end 2018.
Other investment securities (as shown on Park's Consolidated Balance Sheets) consist of stock investments in the FHLB, the FRB and equity securities.

The average maturity of the investment portfolio would lengthen if long-term interest rates were to increase as principal repayments from mortgage-backed securities and CMOs would decrease and callable securities would price to their maturity dates. At year-end 2020, management estimated that the average maturity of the investment portfolio would lengthen to 3.8 years with a 100 basis point increase in long-term interest rates and would lengthen to 3.9 years with a 200 basis point increase in long-term interest rates. Likewise, the average maturity of the investment portfolio would shorten if long-term interest rates were to decrease as the principal repayments from mortgage-backed securities and CMOs would increase and callable securities would price to their call dates. At year-end 2020, management estimated that the average maturity of the investment portfolio would decrease to 3.0 years with a 100 basis point decrease in long-term interest rates and to 2.8 years with a 200 basis point decrease in long-term interest rates.

Net interest income for the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2020 included $3.6 million, $5.1 million and $7.9 million, respectively, related to PPP loans. Excluding the impact of these loan payments and accretion, the tax equivalent net interest margin was 3.85%, 3.95%, 4.05%, and 3.86%, for the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2020, respectively, and 3.82% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
In the following table, the change in tax equivalent interest due to both volume and rate has been allocated to volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each.
Other Income: Other income was $125.7 million in 2020, compared to $97.2 million in 2019, and $101.1 million in 2018.
The following table displays total other income for Park in 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Other income was impacted by the acquisitions of NewDominion and Carolina Alliance. The NewDominion Division and the Carolina Alliance Division contributed an aggregate of $9.5 million and $4.6 million to other income at Park during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
Income from fiduciary activities increased by $1.1 million, or 4.0%, to $28.9 million in 2020, compared to $27.8 million in 2019. The $27.8 million in 2019 was an increase of $1.5 million, or 5.6%, compared to $26.3 million in 2018. The increases in fiduciary fee income in 2020 and 2019 were primarily due to improvements in the equity markets and also due to an increase in the total account balances serviced by PNB’s Trust Department. PNB charges fiduciary fees largely based on the market value of the trust assets. The average market value of the trust assets managed by PNB was $6.17 billion in 2020, compared to $5.85 billion in 2019 and $5.49 billion in 2018.
Service charges on deposit accounts decreased by $2.4 million, or 22.1%, to $8.4 million in 2020, compared to $10.8 million in 2019. The $10.8 million in 2019 was a decrease of $626,000, or 5.5%, compared to $11.5 million in 2018. The declines in 2020 and 2019 were related to declines in service charges on deposits, largely as a result of a decline in other non-sufficient funds (NSF) fee income and service charges on demand deposit accounts.
Other service income increased $22.1 million, or 142.7%, to $37.6 million in 2020, compared to $15.5 million in 2019. The $15.5 million in 2019 was an increase of $1.2 million, or 8.6%, compared to $14.3 million in 2018. The increase in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily related to increase in other service income related to mortgage loan originations, including a $17.2 million increase in fee income related to a $686.5 million increase in mortgage loan originations to be sold in the secondary market, a $1.7 million increase in income related to investor rate locks and loans held for sale, and a $2.3 million increase in mortgage servicing rights income. Sold mortgage origination volume increased by $747.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in 2019 compared to 2018 was related to increases in other service income due to the acquisitions of NewDominion and Carolina Alliance which increased sold mortgage loan originations.
Debit card fee income, which is generated from debit card transactions, increased $1.9 million, or 9.4%, to $22.2 million, compared to $20.3 million in 2019. The $20.3 million in 2019 was an increase of $2.9 million, or 16.9%, compared to $17.3 million in 2018. The increases in 2020 and 2019 were attributable to continued increases in the volume of debit card transactions, which increased 4.4% in 2020 from 2019 and increased 7.4% in 2019 from 2018. In addition, the increase in 2020 and 2019 was attributable to changes in our point of sale network. Park continues to focus on deposit offerings that incent our customers to use their debit card.
Bank owned life insurance income decreased by $2.3 million, or 33.1%, to $4.6 million in 2019, compared to $6.8 million in 2018. The decrease in 2019 from 2018 of $2.3 million was primarily related to income from death benefits paid on
policies. Park recorded $223,000 of income from death benefits paid on policies in 2019, compared to $2.7 million of income from death benefits paid on policies during 2018.
Gain (loss) on the sale of OREO, net, reflected income of $1.2 million in 2020, an increase of $1.4 million, compared to a loss of $222,000 in 2019, and the loss of $222,000 in 2019 reflected a decrease of $4.5 million, compared to a gain of $4.2 million in 2018. The increase in 2020 was primarily due to a $1.2 million gain on the sale of two OREO properties during 2020, one of which was participated to PNB from SEPH. The decrease in 2019 was primarily due to a $4.1 million gain in 2018 on the sale of one OREO property, which was partially participated to PNB from SEPH.
During 2020, Park sold certain AFS debt securities with a book value of $112.5 million at a gross loss of $64,000, and sold certain AFS debt securities with a book value of $196.4 million at a gross gain of $3.4 million. During 2019, Park sold certain AFS debt securities with a book value of $62.4 million at a gross loss of $692,000, and sold certain AFS debt securities with a book value of $29.1 million at a gross gain of $271,000. During 2018, Park sold certain AFS debt securities with a book value of $245.0 million at a gross loss of $2.6 million, sold certain AFS debt securities with a book value of $2.0 million at a gross gain of $60,000, and sold certain HTM debt securities with a book value of $7.4 million at a gross gain of $0.3 million. These HTM debt securities had been paid down by 96.3% of the principal outstanding at acquisition.
During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, $(239,000), $345,000 and $(287,000), respectively, of unrealized (losses) gains on equity investments carried at fair value were recorded within "Gain on equity securities, net" on Park's Consolidated Statements of Income. An additional $3.5 million gain recorded within "Gain on equity securities, net" on Park's Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to Park's 8.55% investment in NewDominion which was held at December 31, 2017.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, $2.4 million, $4.8 million and $1.4 million, respectively, of unrealized gains on equity investments carried at NAV were recorded within "Gain on equity securities, net" on Park's Consolidated Statements of Income.
Other components of net periodic pension benefit income increased by $3.2 million, or 68.0%, to $8.0 million in 2020, compared to $4.7 million in 2019. The $4.7 million in 2019 was a decrease of $2.1 million, or 30.6%, compared to $6.8 million in 2018. The increase in 2020 was largely due to an increase in the expected return on plan assets as a result of the increased value of plan assets. The decrease in 2019 was largely due to a decrease in the expected return on plan assets based on a decrease in plan assets and increased interest costs.
Gain on the sale of non-performing loans was $2.8 million for 2018. This was related to certain non-performing loans, which had a book balance of $174,000, that were sold in the fourth quarter of 2018. No non-performing loans were sold in 2020 or 2019.
Other Expense: Other expense was 286.6 million in 2020, compared to $264.0 million in 2019, and $228.8 million in 2018. Other expense increased by $22.6 million, or 8.6% in 2020, and increased by $35.2 million, or 15.4%, in 2019. The following table displays total other expense for Park for 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Other expense was impacted by the acquisitions of NewDominion and Carolina Alliance, which closed July 1, 2018 and April 1, 2019, respectively. The NewDominion Division and the Carolina Alliance Division contributed an aggregate of $27.6 million and $27.2 million to other expense at Park during the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. See Table 31- "Items Impacting Comparability" for further additional expense detail.
Salaries expense increased by $8.5 million, or 7.1%, to $128.0 million in 2020, compared to $119.5 in 2019. The $119.5 million in 2019 was an increase of $15.8 million, or 15.2%, compared to $103.8 million in 2018. The increase in 2020 was due to a $4.6 million increase in salary expense, which was primarily related to increases in base salary and $3.6 million in severance and restructuring related expense, a $1.9 million increase in additional compensation expense, an $850,000 increase in the vacation accrual and a $1.0 million increase in share-based compensation expenses related to PBRSU awards granted under the Park 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2013 Incentive Plan") (prior to 2017) and both PBRSU and TBRSU awards granted under the Park 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan for Employees (the "2017 Employee LTIP").
The increase in salaries expense in 2019 was due to a $13.2 million increase in salary expense, excluding merger-related costs, a $1.6 million increase in salary expense due to merger-related costs for the Carolina Alliance acquisition, and a $1.0 million increase in share-based compensation expense related to PBRSU awards granted under the 2013 Incentive Plan (prior to 2017) and the 2017 Employee LTIP. Park had 1,755 full-time equivalent employees at year-end 2020, compared to 1,907 full-time equivalent employees at year-end 2019, of which 93 full-time equivalent employees were at Carolina Alliance, and compared to 1,782 full-time equivalent employees at year-end 2018, of which 40 full-time equivalent employees were at NewDominion. During 2020, Park closed 23 offices, which resulted to the significant reduction in full-time equivalent employees during 2020.
Employee benefits expense increased $309,000, or 0.8%, to $37.1 million in 2020, compared to $36.8 million in 2019. The $36.8 million in 2019 was an increase of $6.5 million, or 21.5%, compared to $30.3 million in 2018. The increase in 2020 was due to a $2.4 million increase in pension plan expense, a $505,000 increase in miscellaneous employee benefits and a $300,000 increase in the KSOP match, partially offset by a $3.0 million decrease in group insurance costs. The increase in 2019 was due to a $5.0 million increase in group insurance costs, a $1.4 million increase in payroll taxes and a $951,000 increase in the KSOP match, partially offset by a $673,000 decrease in pension plan expense.
Occupancy expense increased by $987,000, or 7.7%, to $13.8 million in 2020, compared to $12.8 million in 2019. The $12.8 million in 2019 was an increase of $1.6 million, or 13.9%, compared to $11.3 million in 2018. The $987,000 increase in 2020 was primarily the result of increased depreciation on premises and a write-down in the right-of-use lease asset related to branches that closed September 30, 2020. The $1.6 million increase in 2019 was primarily related to the acquisition of Carolina Alliance.
Furniture and equipment expense increased $1.8 million, or 10.4%, to $18.8 million in 2020, compared to $17.0 million in 2019. The $17.0 million in 2019 was an increase of $893,000, or 5.5%, compared to $16.1 million in 2018. The increase in 2020 was primarily related to increased expenses related to repairs and maintenance on equipment, which also included software maintenance and costs, as well as increased depreciation on furniture and equipment. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to increases in maintenance and repairs on equipment, as well as the acquisition of Carolina Alliance.
Data processing fees increased by $909,000, or 8.5%, in 2020 to $11.7 million, compared to $10.8 million in 2019. The $10.8 million in 2019 was an increase of $2.3 million, or 26.8%, compared to $8.5 million in 2018. The increase in 2020 was related to increased mortgage processing costs, debit card processing costs and other data processing and software costs. The increase in 2019 was primarily related to the acquisition of Carolina Alliance, as well as an increase in debit card related costs due to an increase in debit card transactions.
Professional fees and services decreased by $2.0 million, or 6.0%, to $31.3 million in 2020, compared to $33.3 million in 2019. The $33.3 million in 2019 was an increase of $4.4 million, or 15.3%, compared to $28.9 million in 2018. This subcategory of total other expense includes legal fees, management consulting fees, director fees, audit fees, regulatory examination fees and memberships in industry associations. The decrease in professional fees and services expense in 2020 was largely related to a $4.4 million decrease in fees related to the acquisition of Carolina Alliance and a $1.0 million decrease in legal expense, partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in management and consulting expense and a $1.2 million increase in title, appraisal and credit costs. The increase in professional fees and services expense in 2019 was largely related to increases in fees related to the acquisition of Carolina Alliance, as well as increases in management and consulting expense.
Insurance expense increased by $3.3 million, or 105.2%, to $6.4 million in 2020, compared to $3.1 million in 2019. The $3.1 million in 2019 was a decrease of $2.2 million, or 40.8%, compared to $5.3 million in 2018. The increase in 2020 and the decrease in 2019 were primarily due to the utilization of a $2.2 million assessment credit to reduce the FDIC insurance expense during the third and fourth quarters of 2019. 2020 was also impacted by an increase in the assessment base compared to 2019.
Communication expense decreased by $1.3 million, or 23.7%, to $4.1 million in 2020, compared to $5.4 million in 2019. The decrease in 2020 was primarily related to a change in statement mailing and production costs, which resulted in
lower direct postage expense, but was more than offset by an increase in supply expense which is included in miscellaneous expense.
Amortization of intangible assets increased $1.8 million, to $2.4 million in 2019, compared to $578,000 in 2018. The amortization of intangible assets was due to the core deposit intangibles from the acquisitions of both NewDominion and Carolina Alliance.
The subcategory "Miscellaneous" other expense includes expenses for supplies, travel, charitable contributions, and other miscellaneous expense. The subcategory miscellaneous other expense decreased by $1.5 million, or 13.1%, to $9.8 million in 2020, compared to $11.2 million in 2019. The $11.2 million in 2019 was an increase of $4.3 million, or 15.4%, compared to $6.9 million in 2018. The $1.5 million decrease in 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in training and travel related expenses as well as a decrease in non-loan related losses. The $4.3 million increase in 2019 was primarily due to a $1.3 million expense related to the write-down of the NewDominion trade name intangible, a $1.3 million increase in operating lease depreciation, a $475,000 increase in training and travel related expenses, a $421,000 increase in miscellaneous merger-related expenses, and a $319,000 increase in supplemental executive retirement plan expense.
Items Impacting Comparability:
From time to time, revenue, expenses, and/or taxes are impacted by items judged by management of Park to be outside of ordinary banking activities and/or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by management of Park at that time to be infrequent or short term in nature. Most often, these items impacting comparability of period results are due to merger and acquisition activities, management restructuring, branch closures, a rebranding initiative, COVID-19 related expenses and revenue and expenses related to former Vision Bank loan relationships. In other cases, they may result from management's decisions associated with significant corporate actions outside of the ordinary course of business.
The following table details those items which management believes impacts the comparability of current and prior period amounts.
Income Taxes: Income tax expense was $26.7 million in 2020, compared to $22.1 million in 2019, and $20.9 million in 2018. Income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 17.3% in 2020, 17.7% in 2019 and 15.9% in 2018. The difference between the statutory federal corporate income tax rate of 21% for 2020 and Park’s effective tax rate reflects permanent tax differences, primarily consisting of tax-exempt interest income from municipal investments and loans, qualified affordable housing and historical tax credits, bank owned life insurance income, and dividends paid on common shares held within Park’s salary deferral plan. Park's permanent federal tax differences for 2020 were approximately $6.7 million, compared to $5.3 million for 2019. Park expects permanent federal tax differences for 2021 will be approximately $5.9 million.
CREDIT EXPERIENCE
The allowance for loan losses is that amount believed adequate to absorb probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio based on management’s evaluation of various factors. The determination of the allowance requires significant estimates, including the timing and amounts of expected cash flows on impaired loans, consideration of current economic conditions, and historical loss experience pertaining to pools of homogeneous loans, all of which may be susceptible to change. The allowance is increased through a provision for loan losses that is charged to earnings based on management’s quarterly evaluation of the factors previously mentioned and is reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries.
Provision for Loan Losses: The provision for loan losses is the amount added to the allowance for loan losses to ensure the allowance is sufficient to absorb probable, incurred credit losses. The amount of the provision for loan losses is determined by management after reviewing the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, historic and current loan loss experience and current economic conditions.
The table below provides additional information on the provision for loan losses and the ALLL for 2020, 2019 and 2018.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, gross income of $9.3 million would have been recognized on loans that were nonaccrual as of December 31, 2020 had these loans been current in accordance with their original terms. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recorded on a cash basis and be included in earnings only when Park expects to receive the entire recorded investment of the loan. Of the $9.3 million that would have been recognized, approximately $3.7 million was included in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Charge-offs for 2020 include the charge-off of $283,000 in specific reserves for which provision expense had been recognized in a prior year, compared to $236,000 for 2019 and $20,000 for 2018. Net (recoveries) charge-offs adjusted for changes in specific reserves as a percentage of average loans for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were (0.24)%, 0.06%, and 0.15%, respectively.
Loans acquired as part of the acquisitions of NewDominion and Carolina Alliance were recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition. An allowance is only established on these loans as a result of credit deterioration post acquisition. As of December 31, 2020, there was a $678,000 allowance related to acquired loans which were not designated as Purchased Credit Impaired ("PCI") and an allowance of $167,000 related to acquired PCI loans.
SEPH, as a non-bank subsidiary of Park, does not carry an ALLL balance, but recognizes a provision for loan losses when a charge-off is taken and recognizes a recovery of loan losses when a recovery is received.
At year-end 2020, the allowance for loan losses was $85.7 million, or 1.19%, of total loans outstanding, compared to $56.7 million, or 0.87%, of total loans outstanding at year-end 2019, and $51.5 million, or 0.90% of total loans outstanding at year-end 2018. The table below provides additional information related to specific reserves on impaired commercial loans, additional reserves on PCI loans and general reserves for all other loans in Park’s portfolio at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
(1) Excludes PCI loans which are individually evaluated for impairment due to additional credit deterioration post acquisition. These loans had a balance of $0, $5,000 and $475,000 as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
(2) Excludes $337.1 million of PPP loans and $337,000 in related allowance at December 31, 2020. No PPP loans were outstanding at December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018.
The allowance for loan losses of $85.7 million at December 31, 2020 represented a $29.0 million, or 51.2%, increase compared to $56.7 million at December 31, 2019. This increase was largely the result of a $28.2 million increase in general reserves on total originated loans and a $204,000 increase in specific reserves. As of December 31, 2020, a $678,000 allowance had been established for performing purchased loans and a $167,000 allowance had been established for PCI loans. In addition to the established allowance related to purchased loans, as of December 31, 2020, these loans have a remaining purchase accounting discount of $7.2 million. The $28.2 million increase in general reserves was the result of the estimated increase in incurred losses as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This estimate was established based on consideration of Park's existing environmental loss factors, modification programs Park has put in place, and balances of high risk portfolios such as hotel and accommodations, restaurants and food service and strip shopping centers. Much is still unknown about the long-term economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and management will continue to evaluate this estimate of incurred losses as new information becomes available
Management believes that the allowance for loan losses at year-end 2020 is adequate to absorb probable, incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio. See "Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the discussion under the heading “CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES” earlier in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for additional information on management’s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.
The table below provides a summary of Park's loan loss experience over the past five years:
The following table summarizes Park's allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the past five years:
As of December 31, 2020, Park had no concentrations of loans exceeding 10% to borrowers engaged in the same or similar industries nor did Park have any loans to foreign governments.
Nonperforming Assets: Nonperforming assets include: 1) loans whose interest is accounted for on a nonaccrual basis; 2) troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) on accrual status; 3) loans which are contractually past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest payments, where interest continues to accrue; 4) OREO which results from taking possession of property that served as collateral for a defaulted loan; and 5) other nonperforming assets. As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, other nonperforming assets consisted of aircraft acquired as part of a loan workout.
Generally, management obtains updated appraisal information for nonperforming loans and OREO annually. As new appraisal information is received, management performs an evaluation of the appraisal and applies a discount for anticipated disposition costs to determine the net realizable value of the collateral, which is compared to the outstanding principal balance to determine if additional write-downs are necessary.
The following is a summary of Park’s nonperforming assets at the end of each of the last five years:
Included in nonaccrual loans in the previous table were $1.6 million, $10.3 million and $11.7 million of SEPH nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 30, 2016, respectively. There were no SEPH nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019. Included in OREO totals above were $594,000 of SEPH OREO at December 31, 2020, $929,000 of SEPH OREO at December 31, 2019, $1.5 million of SEPH OREO at December 31, 2018, $7.7 million of SEPH OREO at December 31, 2017 and $7.9 million of SEPH OREO at December 31, 2016.
Park classifies loans as nonaccrual when a loan 1) is maintained on a cash basis because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower, 2) payment in full of principal or interest is not expected, or 3) principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days for commercial loans and 120 days for all other loans. As a result, loans may be classified as nonaccrual despite being current with their contractual terms. The following table details the delinquency status of nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.
Credit Quality Indicators: When determining the quarterly and annual loan loss provision, Park reviews the grades of commercial loans. These loans are graded from 1 to 8. A grade of 1 indicates little or no credit risk and a grade of 8 is considered a loss. Commercial loans that are pass-rated (1 through 4) are considered to be of acceptable credit risk. Commercial loans graded a 5 (special mention) are considered to be watch list credits and a higher loan loss reserve percentage is allocated to these loans. Commercial loans graded a 6 (substandard), also considered watch list credits, are considered to represent higher credit risk and, as a result, a higher loan loss reserve percentage is allocated to these loans. Generally, commercial loans that are graded a 6 are considered for partial charge-off or have been charged down to the net realizable value of the underlying collateral. Commercial loans graded a 7 (doubtful) are shown as nonperforming and Park charges these loans down to their fair value by taking a partial charge-off or recording a specific reserve. Any commercial loan graded an 8 (loss) is completely charged off.
The following table highlights the credit trends within the commercial loan portfolio.
Commercial loans include: (1) commercial, financial and agricultural loans; (2) commercial real estate loans; (3) certain construction real estate loans; (4) certain residential real estate loans; and (5) leases. Park’s watch list includes all criticized and classified commercial loans, defined by Park as loans rated special mention or worse, less those commercial loans currently considered to be impaired.
Park had $102.9 million of non-impaired commercial loans included on the watch list at December 31, 2020, compared to $28.3 million at December 31, 2019, and $16.5 million at December 31, 2018. The existing conditions of these loans do not warrant classification as nonaccrual. However, these loans have shown some weakness and management performs additional analysis regarding each borrower's ability to comply with payment terms. The $74.6 million increase in non-impaired commercial watch list loans from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 was largely due to $73.2 million of hotels and accommodation loans that were downgraded to special mention or substandard as a result of the impact of COVID-19. In addition to the $73.2 million in hotels and accommodation loans that were downgraded to special mention, $22.0 million in hotels and accommodation loans were downgraded to impaired status. Park is closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on
its borrowers' ability to repay their loans in accordance with contractual terms. As additional information becomes available, management will continue to evaluate loans to ensure appropriate risk classification.
Delinquencies have remained low over the past 36 months. Delinquent and accruing loans were $20.1 million, or 0.28% of total loans at December 31, 2020, compared to $23.8 million, or 0.37% of total loans at December 31, 2019, and $31.4 million, or 0.55% of total loans at December 31, 2018.
Impaired Loans: Park’s allowance for loan losses includes an allocation for loans specifically identified as impaired under U.S. GAAP. At December 31, 2020, loans considered to be impaired consisted substantially of commercial loans graded as "substandard" or “doubtful” and placed on non-accrual status. Specific reserves on impaired commercial loans are typically based on management’s best estimate of the fair value of the collateral securing these loans. The amount ultimately charged off for these loans may be different from the specific reserve as the ultimate liquidation of the collateral may be for amounts different from management’s estimates.
Impaired commercial loans were $108.4 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $30.9 million, compared to $77.5 million at December 31, 2019. A majority of this increase occurred in the second and third quarters of 2020 with September 30, 2020 impaired loans totaling $116.1 million. The $108.4 million of impaired commercial loans at December 31, 2020 included $8.8 million of loans modified in a TDR which are currently on accrual status and performing in accordance with the restructured terms, up from $8.4 million at December 31, 2019. Impaired commercial loans are individually evaluated for impairment and specific reserves are established to cover any probable, incurred losses for those loans that have not been charged down to the net realizable value of the underlying collateral or to the net present value of expected cash flows.
As of December 31, 2020, management had taken partial charge-offs of $655,000 related to the $108.4 million of commercial loans considered to be impaired, compared to charge-offs of $719,000 related to the $77.5 million of impaired commercial loans at December 31, 2019. The table below provides additional information related to Park's impaired commercial loans at December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.
PCI loans: In conjunction with the NewDominion acquisition, Park acquired loans with deteriorated credit quality with a book value of $5.1 million which were recorded at the preliminary fair value of $4.9 million. In conjunction with the Carolina Alliance acquisition, Park acquired loans with deteriorated credit quality with a book value of $19.9 million which were recorded at the initial fair value of $18.4 million. The carrying amount of loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality at December 31, 2020 was $11.2 million, of which none were considered impaired due to additional credit deterioration post acquisition. The carrying amount of loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality at December 31, 2019 was $14.3 million, of which $5,000 were considered impaired due to additional credit deterioration post acquisition. The remaining $14.3 million were not included in impaired loan totals. The carrying amount of loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality at December 31, 2018 was $4.4 million, of which $475,000 were considered impaired due to additional credit deterioration post acquisition. The remaining $3.9 million were not included in impaired loan totals.
Allowance for loan losses: Loss factors are reviewed quarterly and updated at least annually to reflect recent loan loss history and incorporate current risks and trends which may not be recognized in historical data.
For all loan types, management considers the following factors in determining loan collectability and the appropriate level of the allowance:
•Changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans, including:
◦Trends (e.g., growth, reduction) in specific categories of the loan portfolio, as well as adjustments to the types of loans offered by PNB and GFSC.
◦Level of and trend in loan delinquencies, troubled loans, commercial watch list and impaired loans.
◦Level of and trend in new nonaccrual loans.
◦Level of and trend in loan charge-offs and recoveries.
•Changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices.
•Changes in national and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio.
•The effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated losses in Park's existing portfolio.
The judgmental increases discussed below incorporate management’s evaluation of the impact of environmental qualitative factors which pose additional risks and assignment of a component of the allowance for loan losses in consideration of these factors. Such environmental qualitative factors include: global, national and local economic trends and conditions; experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff; effects of any changes in lending policies and procedures; and levels of, and trends in, consumer bankruptcies, delinquencies, impaired loans and charge-offs and recoveries. The determination of this component of the allowance for loan losses requires considerable management judgment. Actual loss experience may be more or less than the amount allocated.
Commercial Loans
Excluding acquired loans, the allowance for loan losses related to performing commercial loans was $57.1 million, or 1.55% of the outstanding principal balance of performing commercial loans at December 31, 2020. Excluding acquired loans, at December 31, 2020, the coverage level within the commercial loan portfolio was approximately 5.56 times the 132-month historical loss factor compared to 3.40 times the 120-month historical loss factor at December 31, 2019. Historical loss experience, defined as charge-offs plus changes in specific reserves, over the 132-month period ended December 31, 2020, for the commercial loan portfolio was 0.28%. This 132-month loss experience includes only the performance of the PNB loan portfolio and excludes the impact of PNB participations in Vision Bank loans.
Excluding acquired loans, the overall reserve of 1.55% for other accruing commercial loans breaks down as follows: PPP loans are reserved at 0.10%; pass-rated commercial loans are reserved at 1.64%; special mention commercial loans are reserved at 3.47%; and substandard commercial loans are reserved at 3.83%. The reserve levels for pass-rated, special mention and substandard commercial loans in excess of the 132-month loss experience of 0.28% are due to the following factors which management reviews on a quarterly or annual basis:
•Historical Loss Factor: In calculating the allowance for loan losses, management believes it is appropriate to consider historical loss rates that are comparable to the current period being analyzed, giving consideration to losses experienced over a full cycle. As such, a year is added to the look back period each time historical losses are updated, until the economic cycle is complete, as defined by a period of rising charge-offs, considering both internal and industry trends. In updating the historical loss rates to incorporate 2020 losses, management considered if the economic deterioration as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic represented the end of a cycle for the purposes of the allowance for loan loss calculation, but, due to the historically low level of charge-offs, determined 2020 should be included in the cycle beginning in 2010. For the historical loss factor at December 31, 2020, the Company utilized an annual loss rate, calculated based on an average of the net charge-offs and the annual change in specific reserves for impaired commercial loans, experienced during 2010 through 2020 within the individual segments of the commercial and consumer loan categories.
•Loss Emergence Period Factor: Typically, management calculates the loss emergence period for each commercial loan segment on an annual basis. The loss emergence period is calculated based upon the average period of time it takes from the probable occurrence of a loss event to the loan being moved to nonaccrual. If the loss emergence period for any commercial loan segment is greater than one year, management applies additional general reserves to all performing loans within that segment of the commercial loan portfolio. The loss emergence period was last updated in the fourth quarter of 2019. Management did not update the loss emergence period calculation in 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, management performed a timely analysis into its commercial loan portfolio to identify loans
negatively impacted by the pandemic. This resulted in the downgrade of numerous loans to nonaccrual status within months of the loss event (the COVID-19 pandemic). Including these loans artificially lowers the loss emergence period for 2020. Management does not believe this is reflective of what is expected as the loss emergence period for the remaining portfolio.
During the third quarter of 2020, Park made the decision to extend the loss emergence period on all commercial loan types by six months. Management believes that the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 represents the loss event. Management continues to refine its estimate of incurred losses as a result of this March 2020 loss event. Approximately nine months following the start of the pandemic, Park has experienced very little, if any, increase in delinquencies and charge-offs. Management believes that this is due to the unprecedented level of economic stimulus, CARES Act accommodations, and Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 accommodations provided by the U.S. government which has delayed loan defaults and losses.
•Loss Migration Factor: Park’s commercial loans are individually risk graded. If loan downgrades occur, the probability of default increases, and accordingly, management allocates a higher percentage reserve to those accruing commercial loans graded special mention and substandard. Annually, management calculates a loss migration factor for each commercial loan segment for special mention and substandard credits based on a review of losses over the period of time a loan takes to migrate from pass-rated to impaired. The loss migration factor was last updated in the fourth quarter of 2020.
•Environmental Loss Factor: Management has identified certain macroeconomic factors that trend in accordance with losses in Park’s commercial loan portfolio. Certain environmental loss factors have been determined to correlate with higher charge-offs while other adjustments are based on a subjective evaluation of other environmental loss factors. Environmental factors applicable to the commercial loan portfolio include: the Ohio unemployment rate, percent change in Ohio GDP, the consumer confidence index, the prevalence of fixed rate loans in the portfolio and other environmental factors. In evaluating the ongoing relevance and amount of the other environmental factors, management considers: changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off and recovery practices, changes in national and local economic and business conditions, and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, and the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated losses in Park's existing portfolio. All of these factors are evaluated in relation to the historical look back period. At both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, such subjective environmental loss factor inputs accounted for 42% of the allowance for loan losses driven by environmental loss factors.
These macroeconomic factors are reviewed quarterly and the adjustments made to the environmental loss factor impacting each segment in the performing commercial loan portfolio correlate to changes in the macroeconomic environment in relation to the historical loss period. The environmental loss factors were updated in each quarter of 2020 to consider the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors were increased from 0.60% of applicable loans at December 31, 2019 to 0.675% of applicable loans at March 31, 2020, to 0.75% of applicable loans at June 30, 2020, to 0.825% at September 30, 2020, and to 0.855% at December 31, 2020. The increases in the first and second quarters of 2020 were the result of upward adjustments to the factors for Ohio unemployment, percent change in Ohio GDP and consumer confidence. The increase in the third quarter of 2020 was due to the increased uncertainty in the overall economic environment, the unknown length and severity of the pandemic and the limitations in the incurred loss model to capture all probable incurred losses during such uncertain times. The increase in the fourth quarter was a result of consideration of the other environmental factors in relation to the extended 132-month historical loss period. Management will continue to evaluate this estimate of incurred losses as new information becomes available.
In addition to the increases in the environmental loss factor, in the second quarter, Park added additional reserves for three industries at particularly high risk due to the pandemic: hotels and accommodations, restaurants and food service, and strip shopping centers. These industries have had high levels of deferrals and have been particularly impacted by shut downs of non-essential businesses, increased health department regulations, and changes in consumer behavior. Management expects that a high percentage of the 4-rated credits in these portfolios will eventually migrate to special mention, substandard, or impaired status. As a result, additional reserves totaling $3.8 million were added for these portfolios on top of that already calculated. This amount was calculated by applying the loss factor for special mention credits to all 4-rated loans in these
portfolios. A breakout of the 4-rated balances and additional reserve related to these portfolios is detailed in the following table.
Additionally, management applied a 1% reserve to all hotels and accommodations loans in the general reserve population to account for increased valuation risk. At December 31, 2020, Park's originated hotels and accommodations loans had a balance of $181.4 million with an additional reserve specific to valuation risks of $1.8 million.
As of December 31, 2020, Park had $337.1 million of PPP loans which are included in the commercial, financial and agricultural portfolio segment. These loans are guaranteed by the SBA and thus have not been reserved for using the same methodology as the rest of Park’s loan portfolio. A 10 basis point reserve was calculated for these loans to reflect minimal credit risk.
Consumer Loans
Generally, consumer loans are not individually graded. Consumer loans include: (1) mortgage and installment loans included in the construction real estate segment of the loan portfolio; (2) mortgage, home equity lines of credit ("HELOC"), and installment loans included in the residential real estate segment of the loan portfolio; and (3) all loans included in the consumer segment of the loan portfolio. The amount of loan loss reserve assigned to these loans is based on historical loss experience over the past 132 months, through December 31, 2020. Management generally considers a one-year coverage period (the “Historical Loss Factor”) appropriate because the probable loss on any given loan in the consumer loan pool should ordinarily become apparent in that time frame. However, management may incorporate adjustments to the Historical Loss Factor as circumstances warrant additional reserves (e.g., increased loan delinquencies, improving or deteriorating economic conditions, changes in lending management and changes in underwriting standards). The loss factor applied to Park’s consumer loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020 was based on the historical loss experience over the preceding 132 months, plus an additional judgmental reserve, increasing the total allowance for loan loss coverage in the consumer loan portfolio to 2.63 times the 132-month historical loss factor of 0.28% compared to 1.90 times the 120-month historical loss factor of 0.31% at December 31, 2019.
For the consumer portfolio, a specific COVID-19 factor was added to each segment equal to 75% of the 132-month historical loss factor (representing 9 months of charge-off delay). This increase considers the payment deferrals being provided to consumer loan customers and unprecedented level of government stimulus as well as the likely delays in delinquencies and charge-offs as a result.
Much is still unknown about the economic impact of COVID-19, including the duration of the pandemic, future government programs that may be established as a result of the pandemic, and the resiliency of the U.S. economy. Management will continue to evaluate this estimate of incurred losses as new information becomes available. Given uncertainty about the magnitude and length of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic shutdown, additional loan loss provisions may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods.
Purchased Loans
Loans acquired as part of the acquisitions of NewDominion and Carolina Alliance were recorded at fair value on the respective dates of acquisition. An allowance is only established on these loans as a result of credit deterioration post acquisition. At December 31, 2020, there was a $678,000 allowance related to performing acquired loans. At December 31, 2020, a reserve of $167,000 had been established related to PCI loans. At December 31, 2019, there was no allowance related to performing acquired loans, and a reserve of $268,000 related to PCI loans.
Current Expected Credit Losses: In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ("ASU 2016-13"). The new accounting guidance in FASB ASU 2016-13 replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodolgy, which is referred to as the CECL methodology. The CECL methodology is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables, HTM debt securities, and reinsurance receivables. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor. The CECL methodology requires an entity to estimate credit losses over the life of an asset or off-balance sheet credit exposure. The new accounting guidance was to have been effective for Park for annual reporting periods and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019.
Section 4014 of the CARES Act provided financial institutions with optional temporary relief from having to comply with ASU 2016-13 including the CECL methodology for estimating the allowance for credit losses. This temporary relief was set to expire on the earlier of the date on which the national emergency concerning COVID-19 terminated or December 31, 2020, with adoption being effective retrospectively as of January 1, 2020.
Section 540 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, amended Section 4014 of the CARES Act by extending the relief period provided in the CARES Act. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, modifies the CARES Act so that temporary relief will expire on the earlier of the first day of the fiscal year that begins after the date on which the national emergency concerning COVID-19 terminates or January 1, 2022.
Park elected to delay the implementation of CECL following the approval of the CARES Act. The CECL standard requires financial institutions to calculate an allowance utilizing a reasonable and supportable forecast period which Park has established as a one-year period. In the unprecedented circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and the response thereto, Park believes that adopting the CECL methodology in the first quarter of 2020 would have added an unnecessary level of subjectivity and volatility to the calculation of the allowance for credit losses. With the approval of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, management has elected to further delay adoption of CECL to January 1, 2021. This will allow Park to utilize the CECL standard for the entire year of adoption.
Park formed a cross-functional CECL Committee and engaged a third party vendor to assist with the adoption of ASU 2016-13. The Company currently intends to use a blend of multiple economic forecasts to estimate expected credit losses over a one year reasonable and supportable forecast period and then revert, over a one year period to longer term historical loss experience to arrive at lifetime expected losses. Based on preliminary modeling results, management estimates that the reserve will increase to between $90 million and $100 million upon adoption, with the day 1 increase being recorded through a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2021. The actual impact from adopting this guidance may be subject to change based upon refinement and finalization of the model and associated assumptions, the refinement and finalization of qualitative factors, the implementation and testing of certain internal controls ensuring model effectiveness and management's judgment.
Park expects the Allowance for Credit Losses for unfunded commitments to increase to between $3.5 million and $4.5 million upon adoption of ASU 2016-13, with the day 1 increase being recorded through a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2021.
While it is expected that the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will increase the allowance for credit losses, many factors will determine the ultimate calculation at January 1, 2021. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 will not, however, change the overall credit risk in the Company's loan, lease and investment securities portfolios or the ultimate losses with respect thereto. The transition adjustment to increase the allowance will primarily result in a decrease to shareholders' equity, net of income taxes. The ultimate impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will depend on the composition of the loan, lease and investment securities portfolios, finalization of credit loss models, and macroeconomic conditions and forecasts that exist at the date of adoption.
CAPITAL RESOURCES
Liquidity and Interest Rate Sensitivity Management: Park’s objective in managing its liquidity is to maintain the ability to continuously meet the cash flow needs of customers, such as borrowings or deposit withdrawals, while at the same time seeking higher yields from longer-term lending and investing activities.
Cash and cash equivalents increased by $210.5 million during 2020 to $370.5 million at year end. Cash provided by operating activities was $111.6 million in 2020, $111.6 million in 2019 and $132.0 million in 2018. Net income was the primary source of cash provided by operating activities during each year.
Cash used in investing activities was $455.9 million in 2020, while cash provided by investing activities was $60.1 million in 2019 and $45.4 million in 2018. Investment securities transactions and loan originations/repayments are the major uses or sources of cash in investing activities. Proceeds from the sale, repayment or maturity of investment securities provide cash and purchases of investment securities use cash. Net investment securities transactions provided cash of $188.1 million in 2020, $302.2 million in 2019 and $77.8 million in 2018. Cash used by the net increase in the loan portfolio was $620.2 million in 2020, $216.4 million in 2019 and $57.3 million in 2018.
Cash provided by financing activities was $554.8 million in 2020, while cash used in financing activities was $179.0 million in 2019 and $179.3 million in 2018. A major source of cash provided by or used in financing activities is the net change in deposits. Deposits increased and provided $520.0 million of cash in 2020, $159.7 million of cash in 2019 and $159.6 million of cash in 2018. Other major sources of cash from financing activities are short-term borrowings and long-term debt. In 2020, net short-term borrowings increased and provided $111.6 million in cash and net long-term debt increased and provided $2.1 million in cash. In 2019, net short-term borrowings decreased and used $20.1 million in cash and net long-term debt decreased and used $208.1 million in cash. In 2018, net short-term borrowings decreased and used $169.3 million in cash and net long-term debt decreased and used $100.2 million in cash. Cash used in the repurchase of common shares was $7.5 million in 2020, $40.5 million in 2019 and $5.8 million in 2018. Finally, cash declined by $70.4 million in 2020, $69.1 million in 2019 and $63.0 million in 2018, from the payment of cash dividends.
Funds are available from a number of sources, including the capital markets, the investment securities portfolio, the core deposit base, FHLB borrowings, the capability to securitize or package loans for sale, and a $15.0 million revolving line of credit with another financial institution, which did not have an outstanding balance as of December 31, 2020. In the opinion of Park's management, the present funding sources provide more than adequate liquidity for Park to meet our cash flow needs.
The following table shows interest rate sensitivity data for five different time intervals as of December 31, 2020:
(1)Investment securities and loans that are subject to prepayment are shown in the table by the earlier of their re-pricing date or their expected repayment date and not by their contractual maturity date. Nonaccrual loans of $117.4 million are included within the three-month to twelve-month maturity category.
(2)Management considers interest bearing transaction accounts and savings accounts to be core deposits and, therefore, not as rate sensitive as other deposit accounts and borrowed money. Accordingly, only 29% of interest bearing transaction accounts and 47% of savings accounts are considered to re-price within one year. If all of the interest bearing transaction accounts and savings accounts were considered to re-price within one year, the one-year cumulative gap would change from a positive 15.29% to a negative 12.51%.
The interest rate sensitivity gap analysis provides an overall picture of Park’s static interest rate risk position. At December 31, 2020, the cumulative interest earning assets maturing or repricing within twelve months were $3,873 million compared to the cumulative interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within twelve months of $2,579 million. For the twelve-month cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap position, rate sensitive assets exceeded rate sensitive liabilities by $1,294 million or 15.29% of interest earning assets.
A positive twelve-month cumulative rate sensitivity gap (assets exceed liabilities) would suggest that Park’s net interest margin would increase if interest rates were to increase. Conversely, a negative twelve-month cumulative rate sensitivity gap would suggest that Park’s net interest margin would decrease if interest rates were to increase. However, the usefulness of the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis as a forecasting tool in projecting net interest income is limited. The gap analysis does not consider the magnitude, timing or frequency by which assets or liabilities will reprice during a period and also contains assumptions as to the repricing of transaction and savings accounts that may not prove to be correct.
The cumulative twelve-month interest rate sensitivity gap position at year-end 2019 was a positive $303 million or 3.89% of total interest earning assets. The percentage of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year was 45.7% at year-end 2020, compared to 43.2% at year-end 2019. The percentage of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year was 47.7% at year-end 2020, compared to 55.3% at year-end 2019.
Management supplements the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis with periodic simulations of balance sheet sensitivity under various interest rate and what-if scenarios to better forecast and manage the net interest margin. Park’s management uses an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates. This model is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for balance sheet instruments and incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on the prepayment rate of certain assets and liabilities. This model also includes management’s projections for activity levels of various balance sheet instruments and non-interest fee income and operating expense. Assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into this earnings simulation model. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure net interest income and net income. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies.
Management uses a 50 basis point change in market interest rates per quarter for a total of 200 basis points per year in evaluating the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income and net income over a twelve-month horizon. At December 31, 2020, the earnings simulation model projected that net income would decrease by 2.9% using a rising interest rate scenario and decrease by 8.8% using a declining interest rate scenario over the next year. At December 31, 2019, the earnings simulation model projected that net income would decrease by 1.9% using a rising interest rate scenario and increase by 0.5% using a declining interest rate scenario over the next year. At December 31, 2018, the earnings simulation model projected that net income would decrease by 0.4% using a rising interest rate scenario and decrease by 3.1% using a declining interest rate scenario over the next year. Consistently, over the past several years, Park’s earnings simulation model has projected that changes in interest rates would have only a small impact on net income and the net interest margin. Park’s net interest margin was 3.93% in 2020, 3.89% in 2019 and 3.84% in 2018.

As of December 31, 2020, Park had $6.2 million in unfunded commitments related to certain equity investments which are not included in "Table 41 - Contractual Obligations" above. Commitments are funded when capital calls are made by the general partner.
The Corporation’s operating lease obligations represent short-term and long-term lease and rental payments for facilities and equipment. Purchase obligations represent obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Corporation.
Commitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: In order to meet the financing needs of our customers, the Corporation issues loan commitments and standby letters of credit. At December 31, 2020, the Corporation had $1,372.2 million of loan commitments for commercial, commercial real estate, and residential real estate loans and had $17.0 million of standby letters of credit.

Commitments to extend credit under loan commitments and standby letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. These commitments often expire without being drawn upon. However, all of the loan commitments and standby letters of credit were permitted to be drawn upon in 2020. See "Note 25 - Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk and Financial Instruments with Concentration of Credit Risk" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "ITEM 8.

At December 31, 2020, tangible shareholders' equity was 9.57% of total tangible assets [total assets ($9,279 million) less goodwill ($159.6 million) and other intangible assets ($9.3 million)], compared to 9.51% of total tangible assets [total assets ($8,558 million) less goodwill ($159.6 million) and other intangible assets ($11.5 million)] at December 31, 2019.
Net income was $127.9 million in 2020, $102.7 million in 2019 and $110.4 million in 2018.
Cash dividends declared for Park's common shares were $70.6 million in 2020, $69.5 million in 2019 and $63.6 million in 2018. On a per share basis, the cash dividends declared were $4.28 per share in 2020, $4.24 per share in 2019 and $4.07 per share in 2018.
The table below shows the repurchases and issuances of common shares and treasury shares for 2018 through 2020.
Park issued 1,037,205 and 435,457 new common shares, which had not already been held as treasury shares, during 2019 and 2018 in the acquisitions of CABF and NewDominion, respectively, but did not issue any new common shares, which had not already been held as treasury shares, in 2020. Common shares had a balance of $460.7 million, $459.4 million and $358.6 million at December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (net) reflected income of $5.6 million at December 31, 2020, compared to a loss of $9.6 million at December 31, 2019, and a loss of $49.8 million at December 31, 2018. During the 2020 year, the change in net unrealized holding gain (loss) on AFS debt securities, net of income tax, was a gain of $23.2 million. During the 2019 year, the change in net unrealized holding gain (loss) on AFS debt securities, net of income tax, was a gain of $37.7 million. During the 2018 year, the change in net unrealized holding gain (loss) on AFS debt securities, net of income tax, was a loss of $15.6 million. Additionally, Park recognized an other comprehensive loss of $7.7 million, net of income tax, related to the change in pension plan assets and benefit obligations in 2020, compared to an other comprehensive gain of $3.0 million, net of income tax, related to the change in pension plan assets and benefit obligations in 2019, and compared to an other comprehensive loss of $3.0 million, net of income tax, related to the change in pension plan assets and benefit obligations in 2018. Finally, during the 2020 year, Park recognized an other comprehensive loss of $244,000, net of income tax, related to an unrealized net holding loss on cash flow hedging derivatives, compared to an other comprehensive loss of $454,000, net of income tax, related to an unrealized net holding loss on cash flow hedging derivatives in 2019. Beginning accumulated other comprehensive loss (net) as of January 1, 2018, included a $995,000 adjustment related to the adoption of ASU 2016-01- Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.
Financial institution regulators have established guidelines for minimum capital ratios for banks, thrifts and bank holding companies. Park has elected not to include the net unrealized gain or loss on AFS debt securities in computing regulatory capital. During the first quarter of 2015, Park adopted the Basel III regulatory capital framework as approved by the federal banking agencies. The adoption of this framework modified the calculation of the various capital ratios, added an additional ratio, common equity tier 1, and revised the adequately and well-capitalized thresholds under the prompt corrective action regulations applicable to PNB. Additionally, under this framework, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, Park must hold a capital conservation buffer of 2.50% above the adequately capitalized risk-based capital ratios. The Federal Reserve Board also adopted requirements Park must maintain to be deemed "well-capitalized" and to remain a financial holding company.
Park and PNB met each of the well-capitalized ratio guidelines applicable to them at December 31, 2020. The following table indicates the capital ratios for PNB and Park at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
Effects of Inflation: Balance sheets of financial institutions typically contain assets and liabilities that are monetary in nature and, therefore, differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies which have significant investments in premises, equipment and inventory. During periods of inflation, financial institutions that are in a net positive monetary position will experience a decline in purchasing power, which does have an impact on growth. Another significant effect on internal equity growth is other expenses, which tend to rise during periods of inflation.
Management believes the most significant impact on financial results is the Corporation's ability to align our asset/liability management program to react to changes in interest rates.
