During the current fiscal year we ceased doing business with one of our former primary customers due to them becoming a credit risk, this resulted in our decrease in revenue.
Cost of Revenue
For the year ended June 30, 2020, cost of revenue was $398,385, compared to $458,066 for the year ended June 30, 2019; a decrease of $59,681 or 13%. Cost of sales in the current year consists of $129,383 of direct materials, $186,851 of direct labor and $82,152 of manufacturing overhead. Cost of sales in the prior year consists of $228,410 of direct materials, $156,432 of direct labor and $73,224 of manufacturing overhead. Cost of revenue decreased in conjunction with our decrease in revenue.
Professional fees
Professional fees were $37,055 for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to $26,475 for the year ended June 30, 2019; a decrease of $10,580 or 401%. Professional fees consist of accounting, audit and legal fees. The increase in fees in the current year is due to an increase audit fees.
Payroll expense
Payroll expense was $82,113 for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to $42,680 for the year ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $39,433 or 92.4%. The increase can be attributed to an increase of our administrative staff.
General & administrative expenses
General & administrative expenses were $112,550 for the year ended June 30, 2020, compared to $79,153 for the year ended June 30, 2019; an increase of $33,397 or 42.2%. The increase in the current year is partially due to an increase I bad debt and consulting expense.
Other expense
Interest expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 was $43,838 compared to $21,186 for the year ended June 30, 2019. Interest expense has increased due to the addition of our related party loan, line of credit, mortgage and equipment loans. In the current year we also incurred $137,500 of debt discount amortization, a $75,000 loss on the issuance of convertible debt as a result of the issuance of a new convertible promissory note and a $40,000 loss on the issuance of common stock for services.
Net Loss
Net loss for the year ended June 30, 2020 was $321,008, compared to net income of $102,743 for the year ended June 30, 2019. The change from net income in the prior year to a net loss in the current year can be attributed to the loss of one of our larger customers as well as our non-cash expense for stock compensation and the issuance of a convertible note.

We believe that our principal difficulty in our inability to successfully implement our plan in full force and attain profits has been the lack of available capital to operate and expand our business. We believe that because our shareholders can’t deposit their shares and clear shares with certain broker dealers and clearing firms due to extreme FINRA and SEC regulatory burden, it has caused us to not be able to raise capital since we do not have an active trading market for our common stock. As of the date of this filing we have no other commitment from any investor or investment-banking firm to provide us with the necessary funding and there can be no assurances we will obtain such funding in the future. Failure to obtain this additional financing will have a material negative impact on our ability to generate profits in the future. To such end, our auditor has indicated in its report on our financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2020.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Note 2 to the Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, contingencies and taxes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Financial Statements.
We are subject to various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when management concludes that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted.
We recognize deferred tax assets (future tax benefits) and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the expected future tax return consequences of those differences, which are expected to be either deductible or taxable when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Future tax benefits have been fully offset by a 100% valuation allowance as management is unable to determine that it is more likely than not that this deferred tax asset will be realized.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
