ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES AND SHARE AMOUNTS)
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our disclaimer on “Forward-Looking Statements,” “Item 1. Business,” and our Consolidated Financial Statements, the notes to those statements and other financial information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
During fiscal years 2021 and 2020, Trio-Tech International operated in four segments: manufacturing, testing services, distribution, and real estate. In fiscal year 2021, revenue from the manufacturing, testing services, distribution and real estate segments represented 40.5%, 42.7%, 16.7% and 0.1% of our revenue, respectively, as compared to 33.7%, 43.0%, 23.1% and 0.2%, respectively, in fiscal year 2020.
Semiconductor testing and manufacturing (assembly) of test equipment is our core business. We provide third-party semiconductor testing and burn-in services primarily through our laboratories in Asia. At or from our facilities in the U.S. and Asia, we also design, manufacture and market equipment and systems to be used in the testing and production of semiconductors and distribute semiconductor processing and testing equipment manufactured by other vendors.
Our distribution segment operates primarily in Asia. This segment markets and supports distributing complementary products supplied by other manufacturers that are used by its customers and other semiconductor and electronics manufacturers. We believe this will help us to reduce our exposure to multiple risks arising from being a mere distributor of manufactured products from others.
The main revenue component for the real estate segment was rental income.
No other investment income was recorded as “revenue” by the real estate segment in either of fiscal years 2021 or 2020.
The rental income is generated from the rental properties acquired from MaoYe Property Ltd. (“MaoYe”) and Chongqing FuLi Real Estate Development Co. Ltd (“FuLi”) in Chongqing, China. In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the investment made with JiaSheng Property Development Co. Ltd (“JiaSheng”), which was deemed as loans receivable, was transferred to down payment for purchase of investment property in China.
Trio-Tech Chongqing Co., Ltd. (“TTCQ”) invested RMB 5,554 in rental properties in MaoYe during fiscal year 2008, RMB 3,600 in rental properties from JiangHuai Property Development Co. Ltd. (“JiangHuai”) during fiscal year 2010 and RMB 4,025 in rental properties in FuLi during fiscal year 2010. During fiscal year 2019, TTCQ completed the sale of thirteen of the fifteen units constituting the MaoYe property, which contributed a capital gain of $685. The total investment in properties in China was RMB 9,649, in fiscal year 2021 and 2020, approximately $1,493 and $1,363 respectively. The carrying value of these investment properties in China was RMB 4,402 and RMB 4,884, or approximately $681 and $690, in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. These properties generated a total rental income of $28 and $62 for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. TTCQ’s investment in properties that generated rental income is discussed further in this Form 10-K.
TTCQ has yet to receive the title deed for properties purchased from JiangHuai. TTCQ was in the legal process of obtaining the title deed until the developer encountered cash flow difficulties in recent years. Since then, JiangHuai company is under liquidation and is now undergoing asset distribution. The JiangHuai property did not generate any income during fiscal 2021 or 2020.
On October 14, 2014, TTCQ and Jun Zhou Zhi Ye entered into a memorandum of understanding. Based on the memorandum of understanding, both parties agreed to register a sales and purchase agreement upon Jun Zhou Zhi Ye obtaining a license to sell the commercial property (the Singapore Themed Resort Project) located in Chongqing, China. The proposed agreement is for the sale of shop lots with a total area of 1,484.55 square meters as consideration for the outstanding amounts owed to TTCQ by Jun Zhou Zhi Ye as follows:
a) Long-term loan receivable RMB 5,000, or approximately $773, as disclosed in Note 6, plus the interest receivable on the long-term loan receivable of RMB 1,250;
b) Commercial units measuring 668 square meters and
c) RMB 5,900 as part of the unrecognized cash consideration of RMB 8,000 relating to the disposal of the joint venture.
These considerations do not include the remaining outstanding amount of RMB 2,000, or approximately $309, which will be paid to TTCQ in cash.
The shop lots are to be delivered to TTCQ upon completion of the construction of the shop lots in the Singapore Themed Resort Project. The initial targeted date of completion was December 31, 2016. Based on discussions with the developer, the completion date is estimated to be December 31, 2022. The delay was primarily due to the time needed by the developer to work with various parties to inject sufficient funds into this project, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the available information, the developer had applied for asset reorganization and this application is currently pending for further approvals by the local government departments.
The Company recorded a one-time, non-cash impairment charge of $1,580 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 related to the doubtful recovery of a down payment on shop lots in the Singapore Theme Resort Project in Chongqing, China. We elected to take this non-cash impairment charge because of increased uncertainties regarding the project’s viability given the developers weakening financial condition as well as uncertainties arising from the negative real-estate environment in China, implementation of control measures on real-estate lending and its relevant government policies, together with effects of the ongoing pandemic.

General Financial Information
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, total assets increased by $2,646 from $38,306 in fiscal year 2020 to $39,886 in fiscal year 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents, trade account receivables, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets, operating lease right-of-use assets, financed sales receivable and restricted term deposits. The increase was partially offset by the decrease in short term deposits, other receivables, other assets, deferred tax assets, investment properties and property, plant and equipment.
Cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2021, were $5,836, an increase of $1,686, or 40.6%, compared to $4,150 at June 30, 2020, primarily due to the cash inflow generated from the operating activities.
Trade account receivables at June 30, 2021, was $8,293, representing an increase of $2,342, or 39.4%, compared to $5,951 at June 30, 2020. The increase was attributable to an increase in the overall sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 compared to the same period in the last fiscal year. The number of days’ sales outstanding in account receivables was 79 days and 68 days for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
As at June 30, 2021, other receivables were $662, a decrease of $336, or 33.7%, compared to $998 at June 30, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in advance payment to vendors and government grant receivables in the Singapore operations.
Inventories at June 30, 2021, were $2,080, an increase of $158, or 8.2%, compared to $1,922 at June 30, 2020. The increase in inventories was mainly due to the delay requested by one customer for further enhancement. The number of days’ inventory held was 73 days at the end of fiscal 2021, compared to 88 days at the end of fiscal year 2020.
Investment properties in China as of June 30, 2021, were $681, a decrease of $9 from $690 at June 30, 2020. The decrease was attributable to the depreciation charged for the year.
Property, plant and equipment at June 30, 2021, were $9,531, a decrease of $779 compared to $10,310 at June 30, 2020. This was mainly due to depreciation charged for the year and the foreign currency exchange movement between fiscal year 2021 and 2020. The decrease was partially offset by the new acquisition of property, plant and equipment in the Singapore, Malaysia, China and Thailand operations.
Other assets at June 30, 2021, were $262, a decrease of $1,347, or 84%, compared to $1,609 at June 30, 2020. The decrease in other assets was primarily due to the impairment provision for down payment made to Jun Zhou Zhi Ye for the shop lots in the Singapore Themed Resort Project located in Chongqing, China.
Financed sales receivable at June 30, 2021, was $58 arose from a sales-type lease contract entered by the China operation.
Restricted term deposits at June 30, 2021 were $1,741, compared to $1,660 at June 30, 2020. The increase was mainly due to the currency translation difference between functional currency and U.S. dollars from June 30, 2020 to June 30, 2021.
Total liabilities at June 30, 2021, were $12,253, an increase of $1,739, or 16.5%, compared to $10,514 at June 30, 2020. The increase in liabilities was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and operating leases, but partially offset by the decrease in lines of credit, income taxes payable, bank loans payable, finance lease, PPP loan and other non-current liabilities.
Accounts payable as of June 30, 2021, increased by $1,112, or 42.9% to $3,702 from $2,590 as of June 30, 2020. The increase was mainly due to the increase in purchases in the Singapore operations to meet the increase of customer demand.
Accrued expenses as at June 30, 2021, increased by $358, or 11.9% to $3,363 from $3,005 as at June 30, 2020. The increase was mainly due to an increase in accrued payroll liability in the Singapore and China operations.
Income tax payable as at June 30, 2021, decreased by $75 to $699 from $774 as at June 30, 2020. The decrease was mainly due to the repayment made for the Repatriation Tax that arose from the introduction of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act 2017 in fiscal year 2021.
Bank loans payable decreased by $146 to $2,060 as at June 30, 2021, as compared to $2,206 as at June 30, 2020. This was due to the repayments made in the Malaysia operation.
Finance leases decreased by $216 to $450 as at June 30, 2021, as compared to $666 as at June 30, 2020. This was due to the repayments made in the Singapore and Malaysia operations.
Operating lease right-of-use assets and the corresponding lease liabilities increased by $932 to $1,876 as of June 30, 2021, as compared to $944 as at June 30, 2020. This was due to the renewal of the lease agreements in the Singapore and China Operations. The increase was partially offset with the repayment made and the operating lease expenses charged for the period.
As of June 30, 2021, the Company received the loan forgiveness for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) of $121, which was created by the United States Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
Impact of COVID-19 on our Business
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”), was reported to have surfaced in China, resulting in shutdowns of manufacturing and commerce in the months that followed. Since then, the COVID-19 pandemic has spread to multiple countries worldwide and has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the disease and slow its spread, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. These measures have created significant uncertainty and economic disruption, both short-term and potentially long-term.
The health and safety of our employees and our customers are a top priority for us. In an effort to protect our employees, we took and continue to take proactive and aggressive actions, starting with the earliest signs of the outbreak, to adopt social distancing policies at our locations, including working from home and suspending employee travel. Our operations have been classified as part of the global supply chain and essential businesses in many jurisdictions, and employees who are working on-site are required to adhere to strict safety measures, including the use of masks and sanitizer, wellness screenings prior to accessing work sites, staggered break times to prevent congregation, prohibitions on physical contact with coworkers or customers, restrictions on access through only a single point of entry and exit and utilizing video conferencing. We have also incorporated other rules such as restricting visitors to any of our facilities that remain open and proactively providing employees with hand sanitizer.
The most significant near-term impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our financial performance are declines in customers’ revenue in our distribution segment in this fiscal year, as compared to the prior fiscal year. However, we are seeing a recovery in customers’ forecast, which were previously impacted by the supply chain disruption and resulted in the delay in deliveries. In addition, we are seeing an improvement in the manufacturing and testing segments’ financial performance beginning with the second and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, respectively.
The Company received government assistance amounting to $401 in the Singapore and Malaysia operations to mitigate the adverse impact on the business from the pandemic in fiscal year 2021. In fiscal year 2020, the Company also received a PPP loan of $121 in the U.S. operation to support the business amid the pandemic, for which the Company received the full loan forgiveness in fiscal year 2021.
As of June 30, 2021, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits totaling $12,487 and an unused line of credit of $5,641. We finance operations primarily through our existing cash balances, cash collected from operations, bank borrowings and capital lease financing. We believe these sources are sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future.
While we have implemented safeguards and procedures to counter the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the full extent to which the pandemic has and will directly or indirectly impact us, including our business, financial condition, and result of operations, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. The new variant of COVID-19 has resulted in a surge of the number of Covid-19 cases worldwide. This may require further mitigation efforts taken to contain the virus or treat its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets despite a few countries that had loosened their restriction policies. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by the governments or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and stockholders.
Critical Accounting Estimates & Policies
The discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition presented in this section are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. During the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to sales, returns, pricing concessions, bad debts, inventories, investments, fixed assets, intangible assets, income taxes and other contingencies. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets. These estimates and assumptions may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
In response to the SEC’s Release No. 33-8040, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure about Critical Accounting Policy, we have identified the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial status depends. We determined that those critical accounting policies are related to the inventory valuation; allowance for doubtful accounts; revenue recognition; impairment of property, plant and equipment; investment properties and income tax. These accounting policies are discussed in the relevant sections in this management’s discussion and analysis, including the Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements discussed below.
Account Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
During the normal course of business, we extend unsecured credit to our customers in all segments. Typically, credit terms require payment to be made between 30 to 90 days from the date of the sale. We generally do not require collateral from customers. We maintain our cash accounts at credit-worthy financial institutions.
The Company’s management considers the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts: customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic industry trends, and changes in customer payment terms. The Company includes any account balances that are determined to be uncollectible, along with a general reserve, in the overall allowance for doubtful accounts. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. Based on the information available to management, the Company believed that its allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate as of June 30, 2021.
Inventory Valuation
Inventories of our manufacturing and distribution segments, consisting principally of raw materials, works in progress, and finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method, or market value. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change, short-term customer commitments and swiftly changing demand. Provisions for estimated excess and obsolete inventory are based on regular reviews of inventory quantities on hand and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers. Inventories are written down for not-saleable, excess or obsolete raw materials, works-in-process and finished goods by charging such write-downs to cost of sales. In addition to write-downs based on newly introduced parts, statistics and judgments are used for assessing provisions of the remaining inventory based on salability and obsolescence.
Property, Plant and Equipment & Investment Properties
Property, plant and equipment and investment properties are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is provided for over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is provided for over the lease terms or the estimated useful lives of the assets, whichever is shorter, using the straight-line method.
Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged directly to expense as incurred. Additions and improvements to property and equipment are capitalized. When assets are disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation thereon are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income or loss.
Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions
The United States dollar (“U.S. dollar”) is the functional currency of the U.S. parent company. The Singapore dollar, the national currency of Singapore, is the primary currency of the economic environment in which the operations in Singapore are conducted. We also have business entities in Malaysia, Thailand, China and Indonesia, of which the Malaysian ringgit (“RM”), Thai baht, Chinese renminbi (“RMB”) and Indonesian rupiah, are the national currencies. The Company uses the U.S. dollar for financial reporting purposes.
The Company translates assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries outside the U.S. into U.S. dollars using the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date, and the statement of operations is measured using average rates in effect for the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation of the subsidiaries’ financial statements from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars are recorded in shareholders' equity as part of accumulated comprehensive income or loss translation adjustment. Gains or losses resulting from transactions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies of the Company’s subsidiaries are reflected in income for the reporting period.
Revenue Recognition
The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC Topic 606”). This standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers.
We apply a five-step approach as defined in ASC Topic 606 in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized: (1) identifying the contract with customer; (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contracts; (3) determining the transaction price; (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognizing revenue when the corresponding performance obligation is satisfied.
Revenue derived from testing services is recognized when testing services are rendered. Revenue generated from sale of products in the manufacturing and distribution segments are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the products has occurred, customer acceptance has been obtained (which means the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer), the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Certain customers can request for installation and training services to be performed for certain products sold in the manufacturing segment. These services are mainly for helping customers with the test runs of the machines sold and are considered a separate performance obligation. Such services can be provided by other entities as well, and these do not significantly modify the product. The Company recognizes the revenue at the point in time when the Company has satisfied its performance obligation.
In the real estate segment: (1) revenue from property development is earned and recognized on the earlier of the dates when the underlying property is sold or upon the maturity of the agreement; if this amount is uncollectible, the agreement empowers the repossession of the property, and (2) rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. This means that, with respect to a particular lease, actual amounts billed in accordance with the lease during any given period may be higher or lower than the amount of rental revenue recognized for the period. Straight-line rental revenue is commenced when the tenant assumes possession of the leased premises. Accrued straight-line rents receivable represents the amount by which straight-line rental revenue exceeds rents currently billed in accordance with lease agreements.
Investment
The Company (a) evaluates the sufficiency of the total equity at risk, (b) reviews the voting rights and decision-making authority of the equity investment holders as a group, and whether there are any guaranteed returns, protection against losses, or capping of residual returns within the group and (c) establishes whether activities within the venture are on behalf of an investor with disproportionately few voting rights in making this VIE determination. The Company would consolidate a venture that is determined to be a VIE if it was the primary beneficiary. Beginning January 1, 2010, a new accounting standard became effective and changed the method by which the primary beneficiary of a VIE is determined. Through a primarily qualitative approach, the variable interest holder, if any, who has the power to direct the VIE’s most significant activities is the primary beneficiary. To the extent that the investment does not qualify as VIE, the Company further assesses the existence of a controlling financial interest under a voting interest model to determine whether the venture should be consolidated.
Equity Method
The Company analyzes its investments in joint ventures to determine if the joint venture should be accounted for using the equity method. Management evaluates both Common Stock and in-substance Common Stock as to whether they give the Company the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the joint venture even though the Company holds less than 50% of the Common Stock and in-substance Common Stock. If so, the net income of the joint venture will be reported as “Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures, net of tax” in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income or loss.
Cost Method
Investee companies not accounted for under the consolidation or the equity method of accounting are accounted for under the cost method of accounting. Under this method, the Company’s share of the earnings or losses of such investee companies is not included in the consolidated balance sheet or consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income or loss. However, impairment charges are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income or loss. If circumstances suggest that the value of the investee company has subsequently recovered, such recovery is not recorded.
Long-Lived Assets & Impairment
Our business requires heavy investment in manufacturing facilities and equipment that are technologically advanced but can quickly become significantly underutilized or rendered obsolete by rapid changes in demand. We have recorded intangible assets with finite lives related to our acquisitions.
We evaluate our long-lived assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for our business, significant negative industry or economic trends, and a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time. Impairment is recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value, and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analysis, if there is significant adverse change.
While we have not identified any changes in circumstances requiring further impairment test in fiscal year 2021 other than the circumstances related to the Singapore Theme Resort Project, we will continue to monitor impairment indicators, such as disposition activity, stock price declines or changes in forecasted cash flows in future periods. If the fair value of our reporting unit declines below the carrying value in the future, we may incur additional impairment charges.
During the third quarter of 2020, our operation in China provided impairment loss of $139 for seven pieces of equipment because one of our customers’ products came to the end of its product burn-in cycle earlier than expected. The cost of converting the seven pieces of equipment outweighed the benefit of utilizing said equipment. Operations did not foresee any future usage of these assets. There will be no future economic cash inflow generated from these assets. Based on these events, we concluded that it was more likely than not that value-in-use of these assets was less than their carrying value. Full impairment of these assets has been recorded.
During the fourth quarter of 2021, The Company recorded a impairment charge of $1,580 related to the doubtful recovery of a down payment on shop lots in the Singapore Theme Resort Project in Chongqing, China. The Company elected to take this non-cash impairment charge because of increased uncertainties regarding the project’s viability given the developers weakening financial condition as well as uncertainties arising from the negative real-estate environment in China, implementation of control measures on real-estate lending and its relevant government policies, together with effects of the ongoing pandemic.
Fair Value Measurements
Under the standard ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC Topic 820”), fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts its business. ASC Topic 820 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. In support of this principle, ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Under the standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy.
Income Tax
We account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASC Topic 740”), which requires an entity to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequence attributable to the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. Further, the effects of enacted tax laws or rate changes are included as part of deferred tax expenses or benefits in the period that covers the enactment date. Management believed it was more likely than not that the future benefits from these timing differences would not be realized. Accordingly, a full allowance was provided as of June 30, 2021, and 2020.
The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.
Stock-Based Compensation
We calculate compensation expense related to stock option awards made to employees and directors based on the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant. We determine the grant date fair value of our stock option awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and for awards without performance condition the related stock-based compensation is recognized over the period in which a participant is required to provide service in exchange for the stock-based award, which is generally four years. We recognize stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated statements of shareholders' equity based on awards ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs materially from original estimates.
Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires significant judgement. The determination of the grant date fair value of stock-based awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is affected by our estimated common stock fair value as well as other subjective assumptions including the expected term of the awards, the expected volatility over the expected term of the awards, expected dividend yield and risk-free interest rates. The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent management’s best estimates and are as follows:
●
Fair Value of Common Stock. We determined the fair value of each share of underlying common stock based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant.
●
Expected Term. The expected term of employee stock options reflects the period for which we believe the option will remain outstanding based on historical experience and future expectations.
●
Expected Volatility. We base expected volatility on our historical information over a similar expected term.
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements
We adopted ASC Topic 810, Consolidation (“ASC Topic 810”). This guidance establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This guidance requires that noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries be reported in the equity section of the controlling company’s balance sheet. It also changes the manner in which the net income of the subsidiary is reported and disclosed in the controlling company’s income statement.
Loan Receivables
The loan receivables are classified as current assets carried at face value and are individually evaluated for impairment. The allowance for loan losses reflects management’s best estimate of probable losses determined principally on the basis of historical experience and specific allowances for known loan accounts. All loans or portions thereof deemed to be uncollectible or to require an excessive collection cost are written off to the allowance for losses.
Interest Income
Interest income on loans is recognized on an accrual basis. Discounts and premiums on loans are amortized to income using the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity. The amortization of discounts into income is discontinued on loans that are contractually 90 days past due or when collection of interest appears doubtful.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06: Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivative and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). This ASU reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock, as well as amend the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions. In addition, this ASU improves and amends the related EPS guidance. These amendments are effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption is either a modified retrospective method or a fully retrospective method of transition. The Company has completed its assessment and concluded that this update has no significant impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In March 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-04 ASC Topic 848: Reference Rate Reform: Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or by another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The amendments are effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020, and the Company may elect to apply the amendments prospectively through December 31, 2022. The Company has completed its assessment and concluded that this update has no significant impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In June 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-13 ASC Topic 326: Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (“ASC Topic 326”) for the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted, although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. ASC Topic 326 is effective for the Company for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company has completed its assessment and concluded that this update has no significant impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Other new pronouncements issued but not yet effective until after June 30, 2021, are not expected to have a significant effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Comparison of Operating Results
The following table presents certain data from the consolidated statements of operating income as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, and 2020:
Overall Revenue
The overall revenue is composed of the revenues from the manufacturing, testing services, distribution and real estate segments. The following table presents the components of the overall revenue realized in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 in percentage format.
Revenue in fiscal year 2021 was $32,462, a decrease of $2,003, or 5.8%, compared to $34,465 in fiscal year 2020. The decrease in revenue was due to a decrease in sales across all segments amid the pandemic except the manufacturing segment.
As a percentage of total revenue, the revenue generated by the manufacturing segment in fiscal year 2021 accounted for 40.5%, an increase of 6.8%, as compared to 33.7% in fiscal year 2020. In terms of dollar amount, the revenue generated by the manufacturing segment in fiscal year 2021 was $13,151, reflecting an increase of $1,546, or 13.3%, compared to $11,605 in fiscal year 2020. The increase in revenue generated by the manufacturing segment was due to an increase in the manufacturing segment in the U.S. and Singapore operations. Despite substantial headwinds caused by the pandemic, the demand for our equipment was strong in this fiscal year.
Backlog in the manufacturing segment was $5,040 as of June 30, 2021, representing an increase of $30 from $5,010 as of June 30, 2020. We expect the demand for our products to increase at a slower pace in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021, depending on the recovery speed of the global market for testing equipment and systems from the highly uncertain economy outlook caused by the pandemic.
As a percentage of total revenue, the revenue generated by the testing services segment in fiscal year 2021 accounted for 42.7% of total sales compared to 43.0% in fiscal year 2020. In terms of dollar amounts, the revenue generated by the testing services segment for fiscal year 2021 was $13,846, reflecting a decrease of $994, or 6.7% compared to $14,840 for fiscal year 2020. The decrease in revenue generated by the testing segment was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue in the Malaysia and China operations. The decrease was attributable to a decrease in the volume of testing services requested by our customers in these operations amid the global pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by the increase in revenue as a result of higher volume in the Singapore and Thailand operations during fiscal year 2021. With effect from fiscal 2022, the Company had increased its average selling price for testing services. Demand for testing services varies from country to country, depending on changes taking place in the market and our customers’ forecasts. Because it is difficult to accurately forecast fluctuations in the market, we believe that it is necessary to maintain testing facilities in close proximity to our customers in order to make it convenient for them to send us their newly manufactured parts for testing and to enable us to maintain a share of the market.
Backlog in the testing services segment as of June 30, 2021, was $3,775, an increase of $860 as compared to $2,915 at June 30, 2020. The increase in backlog was mainly from the China operations. The backlog depends on the estimates volume provided by customers, which are in turn dependent upon the customers’ inventory levels and demand.
As a percentage of total revenue, the revenue generated by the distribution segment in fiscal year 2021 accounted for 16.7% of total sales, a decrease of 6.4% compared to 23.1% in fiscal year 2020. In terms of dollar amounts, revenue for fiscal year 2021 was $5,437, a decrease of $2,521, or 31.7%, compared to $7,958 for fiscal year 2020. The decrease in revenue in our distribution segment was due to the decrease in orders from the major customers in our Singapore operations during the uncertain market caused by the pandemic.
Backlog in the distribution segment as of June 30, 2021, was $4,648, reflecting an increase of $3,239 compared to the backlog of $1,409 at June 30, 2020. The increase in backlog was mainly due to an increase in the forecast from customers, coupled with the disruption of the supply, which resulted in the delay of deliveries. We believe that our competitive advantage in the distribution segment is our design and engineering capabilities in components and touch screen products, which allow customization to meet the specific requirement of our customers. Product volume for the distribution segment depends on sales activities such as placing orders and queries for products and backlog. Equipment and electronic component sales are very competitive, as the products are readily available in the market.
As a percentage of total revenue, the revenue generated by the real estate segment was 0.1% and 0.2% of total sales in fiscal year 2021 and 2020, respectively. In terms of dollar value, revenue generated by the real estate segment for fiscal years 2021 was $28, a decrease of $34, or 54.8%, compared to $62 for fiscal year 2020. Our real estate segment saw a decrease in rental income due to the low occupancy rate in MaoYe and FuLi properties amid the pandemic.
Backlog in the real estate segment as of June 30, 2021 was $40, an increase of $34 as compared to $6 at June 30, 2020.
Overall Gross Margin
Overall gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 23.6% in fiscal year 2021, an increase of 2.5% compared to 21.1% in fiscal year 2020. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was mainly attributable to the manufacturing segments. In terms of dollar value, the overall gross profit for fiscal year 2021 was $7,670, an increase of $404, or 5.6%, compared to $7,266 for fiscal year 2020. The increase in the dollar value of the overall gross margin was mainly due to an increase of sales in the manufacturing segments, which was partially offset by a decrease in sales in the testing and distribution segment.
The gross margin as a percentage of revenue in the manufacturing segment was 25.4% in fiscal year 2021, an increase of 2.3% compared to 23.1% in fiscal year 2020. In terms of dollar amounts, the gross profit for the manufacturing segment in fiscal year 2021 was $3,342, an increase of $664, or 24.8%, compared to $2,678 in fiscal year 2020. The increase in the absolute dollar amount of gross margin was mainly due to an increase in revenue in our Singapore operations.
The gross margin as a percentage of revenue in the testing services segment was 24.7% in fiscal year 2021, an increase of 1.2% compared to 23.5% in fiscal year 2020. The increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the continuous effort of cost control in the China and Malaysia operations, despite a decrease in revenue brought about by a decrease in orders in the China and Malaysia operations. In terms of dollar amounts, gross profit in the testing services segment in fiscal year 2021 was $3,415, a decrease of $72, or 2.1%, compared to $3,487 in fiscal year 2020. A significant portion of our cost of sales is fixed in the testing segment. Thus, as the demand for services and factory utilization decreases, the fixed costs are spread over the decreased output, which decreases the gross profit margin. However, the negative impact on gross profit margin was partially offset by the cost saving measures.
The gross margin as a percentage of revenue in the distribution segment was 17.7% in fiscal year 2021, an increase of 3.7% compared to 14.0% in fiscal year 2020. The increase in gross margin percentage was due to the distribution segment having more sales of products with a higher profit margin compared to the same period of last fiscal year. In terms of dollar amounts, gross profit in the distribution segment was $962, a decrease of $149, or 13.4%, compared to $1,111 in fiscal year 2020. The gross margin of the distribution segment was not only affected by the market price of our products, but also our product mix, which changed frequently as a result of the changed in market demand.
The gross loss margin as a percentage of revenue in the real estate segment was a negative of 175.0% in fiscal year 2021, an increase of 158.9% compared to 16.1% in fiscal year 2020. In absolute dollar amount, gross loss margin in the real estate segment was $49 in fiscal year 2021, an increase of $39 as compared to $10 in fiscal year 2020. The increase in gross loss was due to lower rental income amid the pandemic.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:
General and administrative expenses were $6,938 in fiscal year 2021, compared to $7,064 in fiscal year.
Selling expenses decreased by $233, or 34.3%, to $446 in fiscal year 2021, compared to $679 in fiscal year 2020. The decrease in selling expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in commission expenses in the Singapore operations as a result of fewer commissionable sales, coupled with lower traveling expenses due to the worldwide travel restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the pandemic.
Loss from Operations
Loss from operations was $70 in fiscal year 2021, an increase of $877, as compared to $947 in fiscal year 2020 (restated).
Interest Expenses
The interest expenses for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were as follows:
Interest expenses decreased by $104, or 45.2%, to $126 in fiscal year 2021 from $230 in fiscal year 2020. The decrease in interest expenses was mainly due to lower utilization of short-term loans in the Singapore operations. Additionally, the bank loan payable decreased by $146 to $2,060 in fiscal year 2021, as compared to $2,206 in fiscal year 2020.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was as follows:
Other income increased by $29 to $363 for fiscal year 2021 as compared to $334 for fiscal year 2020. The increase in other income in fiscal year 2021 was mainly due to an increase of $32 and $121 from dividend income and forgiveness of the PPP loan, respectively. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $59 in interest income.
Government grant
During fiscal year 2021, the Company received government grants amounting to $514, of which $401 were the financial assistance received from the Singapore and Malaysia governments amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
During fiscal year 2020, the Company received government grants amounting to $778, of which $718 were the financial assistance received from the Singapore, Malaysia and China governments amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Gain on Sale of Properties
The Company’s Malaysia operation completed the sale of properties and recognized a net gain of RM4,901 or $1,172 in the fiscal year 2020, excluding capital gain tax.
Income Tax (Expenses) / Benefits
Income tax expenses for fiscal year 2021 were $228, representing an increase of $240, as compared to income tax benefits of $12 for fiscal year 2020. The change was primarily because the Company had fully utilized the tax benefits and was subject to tax in the Singapore operation. The one-off and non-cash impairment charge resulted in higher losses before tax, which the Company was still subjected to tax for those profitable operations.
At June 30, 2021, the Company had no federal net operating loss carry-forwards, and a state net operating loss carry-forward of $1,248, which expires in 2033. These carryovers may be subject to limitations under I.R.C. Section 382. Management of the Company is uncertain whether it is more likely than not that these future benefits will be realized. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance was established.
Loss from Discontinued Operations
Loss from discontinued operations was $28 and $3 in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. We discontinued our fabrication segment in fiscal year 2013.
Noncontrolling Interest
As of June 30, 2021, we held an indirect 55% interest each in Trio-Tech (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. (“TTM”), Trio-Tech (Kuala Lumpur) Sdn. Bhd. (“TTKL”), SHI and PT SHI, and a 76% interest in Prestal Enterprise Sdn. Bhd. (“Prestal”). The noncontrolling interest for fiscal year 2021, in the net loss of subsidiaries, was $564, a change of $802 compared to a noncontrolling interest in the net income of $238 for the previous fiscal year. The change in the noncontrolling interest was primarily attributable to the net loss generated by the Malaysia operation in fiscal year 2021, as compared to the net income generated by the Malaysia operations from the sales of properties in fiscal year 2020.
Net (Loss) / Income Attributable to Trio-Tech International Common Shareholders
Net loss attributable for fiscal year 2021 was $591 compared to the net income of $878 for fiscal year 2020 (restated).
(Loss) / Earnings per Share
Basic loss per share from continuing operations was $0.16 in fiscal year 2021, as compared to basic earnings per share of $0.24 in fiscal year 2020 (restated). Basic loss per share from discontinued operations was $nil for fiscal year 2021 and $nil for fiscal year 2020.
Diluted loss per share from continuing operations was $0.15 in fiscal year 2021, as compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.24 in fiscal year 2020 (restated). Diluted loss per share from discontinued operations was $nil for fiscal year 2021 and $nil for fiscal year 2020.
Segment Information
The revenue, gross margin and income or loss from each segment for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 are presented below. As the segment revenue and gross margin have been discussed in previous sections, only the comparison of income or loss from operations is discussed below.
Manufacturing Segment
The revenue, gross margin and income/(loss) from operations for the manufacturing segment for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were as follows:
Income from operations in the manufacturing segment was $376 in fiscal year 2021, an improvement of $702 as compared to a loss from operations of $326 in fiscal year 2020. The net income was attributable to an increase in the absolute amount of gross margin amounting to $664 and a decrease in operating expenses of $38. Operating expenses were $2,966 and $3,004 for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to a decrease in selling expenses of $76. The decrease was partially offset by the increase in general and administrative expenses of $43.
The decrease in selling expenses was primarily due to lower traveling expenses amid the pandemic. The increase in general and administrative expenses was mainly attributable to an increase in payroll-related expenses.
Testing Services Segment
The revenue, gross margin and loss from operations for the testing services segment for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were as follows:
Loss from operations in the testing services segment in fiscal year 2021 was $997 remained comparable from $1,040 in fiscal year 2020. The slight decrease in operating loss was attributable to a decrease in operating expense of $115, partially offset by a decrease in absolute amount of gross margin of $72. Operating expenses were $4,412 and $4,527 for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in operating expenses was mainly attributable to a decrease in selling expenses, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses, coupled with the absence of any impairment on the long-lived asset in this fiscal year.
Distribution Segment
The revenue, gross margin and income from operations for the distribution segment for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were as follows:
Income from operations in the distribution segment was $657 in fiscal year 2021 as compared to $751 in fiscal year 2020. The decrease was mainly due to the decrease in gross margin of $149, as discussed earlier. These decreases were partly offset by a decrease in operating expenses. Operating expenses were $306 and $362 for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Real Estate
The revenue, gross margin and loss from operations for the real estate segment for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were as follows:
Loss from operations in the real estate segment was $116 in fiscal year 2021 as compared to $97 in fiscal year 2020. Operating expenses were $67 and $87 in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Corporate
The following table presents the loss from operations for Corporate for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively:
In fiscal year 2021, corporate operating income was $10, a change of $245 compared to operating loss of $235 in fiscal year 2020.
Liquidity
The Company’s core businesses-testing services, manufacturing and distribution-operate in a volatile industry, in which its average selling prices and product costs are influenced by competitive factors. These factors create pressures on sales, costs, earnings and cash flows, which impact liquidity.
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1,373 to $1,638 for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, from $3,011 in the same period of last fiscal year. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in net income of $2,271, an increase of $121 due to forgiveness of our PPP loan and a decrease of $3,457 cash inflow from trade account receivables. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in the impairment loss on other assets of $1,580 and an increase in accounts payables and accrued expenses of $2,345.
Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $2,050 to an outflow of $567 for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 from $2,617 for the same period of last fiscal year. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in cash inflows of $2,335 from the withdrawal of unrestricted deposits and a decrease of $1,016 for investments in restricted and unrestricted deposits. The decrease in cash outflow partially offset by a decrease of $1,167 from the assets held for sale proceeds.
Net cash used in financing activities for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, was $2, representing a decrease of $730 compared to $732 during the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. Cash outflow decreased mainly due to a decrease in a cash outflow of $1,848 from the payment on lines of credit, and an increase in cash inflow of $754 and $205 from the stock option exercise proceeds and bank loans proceeds, respectively. The increase in cash outflow was partially offset by a decrease in lines of credit payments by $1,888, and elimination of PPP loan amounting to $121.
We believe that our projected cash flows from operations, borrowing availability under our revolving lines of credit, cash on hand, trade credit and the secured bank loans will provide the necessary financial resources to meet our projected cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. Should we find an attractive capital investment, we may seek additional debt or equity financing in order to fund the transaction, in the form of bank financing, convertible debt, or the issuance of Common Stock.
Capital Resources
Our working capital (defined as current assets minus current liabilities) has historically been generated primarily from the following sources: operating cash flow, availability under our revolving line of credit, and short-term loans. The working capital was $15,200 as of June 30, 2021, representing an increase of $2,243, or 17.3%, compared to working capital of $12,957 as of June 30, 2020 (restated). The increase in working capital was mainly due to increases in current assets such as cash and cash equivalents, trade account receivables, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets and decreases in current liabilities such as lines of credit, income taxes payable, bank loans payable, finance leases and PPP loan. Such fluctuations were partially offset by decreases in current assets such as short-term deposits, other receivables and increases in current liabilities such as accounts payable, accrued expenses, and operating lease payable, as discussed above.
The majority of our capital expenditures are based on demands from our customers, as we are operating in a capital-intensive industry. Our capital expenditures were $1,112 and $1,017 for fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020, respectively. The capital expenditures in fiscal year 2021 were mainly in the Singapore, China, Malaysia and Thailand operations, which provide testing services to our customers. We financed our capital expenditures and other operating expenses through operating cash flows and long-term debts.
Our credit rating provides us with ready and adequate access to funds in the global market. At June 30, 2021, the Company had certain lines of credit that are collateralized by restricted deposits.
As of June 30, 2020, the Company had certain lines of credit that are collateralized by restricted deposits.
On November 18, 2019, Trio-Tech International Pte. Ltd. signed an agreement with JECC Leasing (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. for an Account Receivables Financing facility for SGD 1,000, or approximately $743 based on the market exchange rate. Interest is charged at LIBOR rate +1.3% for USD financing and SIBOR rate +1.25% for SGD financing. The financing facility was set up to facilitate the working capital in our operations in Singapore. The Company started to use this facility in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not consider the Company to have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
