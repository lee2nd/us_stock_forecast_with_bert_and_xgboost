Going Concern
The audited consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K have been prepared on the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has accumulated losses from inception through the period ended December 31, 2020, of $51,560,884 as well as negative cash flows from operating activities. Furthermore, as of the date of this filing, the Company does not have sufficient cash resources to achieve its goals through December 31, 2021.

Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, the Company may not be able to take advantage of prospective business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict its future plans for developing its business and achieving commercial revenues. If the Company is unable to obtain necessary capital, the Company may have to cease operations.
