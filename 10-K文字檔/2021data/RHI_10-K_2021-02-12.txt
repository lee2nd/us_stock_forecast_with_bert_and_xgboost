Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Certain information contained in Management’s Discussion and Analysis and in other parts of this report may be deemed forward-looking statements regarding events and financial trends that may affect the Company’s future operating results or financial positions. These statements may be identified by words such as “estimate”, “forecast”, “project”, “plan”, “intend”, “believe”, “expect”, “anticipate”, or variations or negatives thereof or by similar or comparable words or phrases. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: changes to or new interpretations of U.S. or international tax regulations, the global financial and economic situation; the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to mitigate its spread; changes in levels of unemployment and other economic conditions in the United States or foreign countries where the Company does business, or in particular regions or industries; reduction in the supply of candidates for contract employment or the Company’s ability to attract candidates; the entry of new competitors into the marketplace or expansion by existing competitors; the ability of the Company to maintain existing client relationships and attract new clients in the context of changing economic or competitive conditions; the impact of competitive pressures, including any change in the demand for the Company’s services, on the Company’s ability to maintain its margins; the possibility of the Company incurring liability for its activities, including the activities of its engagement professionals, or for events impacting its engagement professionals on clients’ premises; the possibility that adverse publicity could impact the Company’s ability to attract and retain clients and candidates; the success of the Company in attracting, training, and retaining qualified management personnel and other staff employees; the Company’s ability to comply with governmental regulations affecting personnel services businesses in particular or employer/employee relationships in general; whether there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes-Oxley or other regulatory compliance services; the Company’s reliance on short-term contracts for a significant percentage of its business; litigation relating to prior or current transactions or activities, including litigation that may be disclosed from time to time in the Company’s Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings; the ability of the Company to manage its international operations and comply with foreign laws and regulations; the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the possibility that the additional costs the Company will incur as a result of health care reform legislation may adversely affect the Company’s profit margins or the demand for the Company’s services; the possibility that the Company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems could be damaged or their service interrupted or the Company could experience a cybersecurity breach; and the possibility that the Company may fail to maintain adequate financial and management controls and as a result suffer errors in its financial reporting. Additionally, with respect to Protiviti, other risks and uncertainties include the fact that future success will depend on its ability to retain employees and attract clients; there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes-Oxley or other regulatory compliance services; failure to produce projected revenues could adversely affect financial results; and there is the possibility of involvement in litigation relating to prior or current transactions or activities. Because long-term contracts are not a significant part of the Company’s business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results.
Executive Overview
The Company’s financial results during 2020 were affected by the economic crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in the Company’s staffing business. Annual service revenues reached $5.11 billion in 2020, a decrease of 15.9% from the prior year. Full-year 2020 net income decreased to $306 million and diluted net income per share decreased to $2.70. Both the temporary and consultant staffing segment and the permanent placement staffing segment experienced revenue declines, while revenue in the risk consulting and internal audit services segment increased 11.8% in 2020 compared to last year.
Demand for the Company’s contract and consulting staffing, permanent placement staffing, and risk consulting and internal audit services is largely dependent upon general economic and labor trends both domestically and abroad. Although COVID-19 continues to impact the global economy, the Company has prioritized the health and safety of its employees, and a majority of global staffing and Protiviti employees continue working remotely. The Company has maintained full operations even where physical locations have remained closed. We believe that the Company is well positioned to participate fully as broader economic growth returns. Despite continued general economic declines, there is still strong competition for skilled talent, which increases the Company’s value to clients.
The extent of the economic disruption on the Company’s operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic and related actions taken by the U.S. government, state and local government officials, and international governments to prevent disease spread, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.
Given the magnitude of the COVID-19 impact on the Company’s business, we have worked to effectively manage our costs and pursue revenue-generation opportunities.
Protiviti continued its record of multi-year double-digit revenue growth, with particular strength in its technology consulting practice, and it continues to benefit from multiple solutions offerings and pipeline, including particularly robust growth from the blended solutions with the Company’s temporary and consultant staffing operations.
The United States economic backdrop during 2020 was one of uncertainty as real gross domestic product (“GDP”) decreased 3.5% compared with an increase of 2.3% in 2019. The unemployment rate increased from 3.5% in December 2019, to a peak of 14.7% during April 2020, ending with 6.7% in December 2020.
We monitor various economic indicators and business trends in all of the countries in which we operate to anticipate demand for the Company’s services. We evaluate these trends to determine the appropriate level of investment, including personnel, which will best position the Company for success in the current and future global macroeconomic environment. The Company’s investments in headcount are typically structured to proactively support and align with expected revenue growth trends and productivity metrics. We have limited visibility into future revenues not only due to the dependence on macroeconomic conditions noted above, but also because of the relatively short duration of the Company’s client engagements. Accordingly, we typically assess headcount and other investments on at least a quarterly basis. As such, during 2020, we decreased headcount in our staffing lines of business but increased headcount in the Protiviti line of business when compared to prior year-end levels. We are focused on the productivity levels of tenured staff and believe we have aligned staffing levels to drive increased profitability.
Capital expenditures, including $33 million related to cloud computing implementations, in 2020 totaled $67 million, approximately 71% of which represented investments in software initiatives and technology infrastructure, both of which are important to the Company’s future growth opportunities. Capital expenditures for cloud computing implementation costs are included in cash flows from operating activities on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Capital expenditures also included amounts spent on tenant improvements and furniture and equipment in the Company’s leased offices. We currently expect that 2021 capitalized expenditures will range from $85 million to $95 million, of which $50 million to $60 million relates to software initiatives and technology infrastructure, including capitalized costs relating to the implementation of cloud computing arrangements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
As described below, the Company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates are those that involve subjective decisions or assessments.
Service Revenues. The Company derives its revenues from three segments: temporary and consultant staffing, permanent placement staffing, and risk consulting and internal audit services. Revenues are recognized when promised goods or services are delivered to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. See Note C-“Revenue Recognition” to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II-Item 8 of this report.
Income Taxes. The Company’s operations are subject to U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign income taxes. In establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities and its provision for income taxes, the Company makes judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws that are applicable to its operations in various jurisdictions. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using current enacted tax rates, which the Company expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. The likelihood of a material change in the Company’s expected realization of its deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income and the effectiveness of its tax planning in the various relevant jurisdictions.
The Company also evaluates the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts. Management evaluates all positive and negative evidence and uses judgment regarding past and future events, including operating results, to help determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized. When appropriate, a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized. Valuation allowances of $24.1 million and $21.6 million were recorded as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The valuation allowances recorded relate primarily to net operating losses in certain foreign operations. If such losses are ultimately utilized to offset future segment income, the Company will recognize a tax benefit up to the full amount of the related valuation reserve.
While management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may materially affect the future financial results of the Company.

Results of Operations
Demand for the Company’s temporary and consultant staffing, permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services is largely dependent upon general economic and labor market conditions both domestically and abroad. Because of the inherent difficulty in predicting economic trends, future demand for the Company’s services cannot be forecast
with certainty. The Company’s investments in technology have allowed its internal staff to remain fully functional while working remotely during this pandemic. While uncertainty remains in the overall economic environment, we enter 2021 with renewed optimism about the Company’s positioning for future growth. We have retained our key staff and they are committed to driving our success as the backbone of our enterprise. Our technology investments have facilitated remote working models internally and, with the Company's advanced AI-driven capabilities, are providing clients with real-time choices of candidates from outside their local market area. Owing to its diversified solution offerings, Protiviti continues its record of multi-year double-digit revenue growth. The collaboration between Protiviti and staffing is at an all-time high.
The Company’s temporary and permanent staffing business conducts placement activities through 326 offices in 42 states, the District of Columbia and 17 foreign countries, while Protiviti has 62 offices in 23 states and 12 foreign countries.
The Company has changed its Consolidated Statements of Operations to separately present (income) loss from
investments held in employee deferred compensation trusts. Under the Company’s employee deferred compensation plans,
employees direct the investment of their account balances, and the Company invests amounts held in the associated investment
trusts consistent with these directions. As realized and unrealized investment gains and losses occur, the Company’s deferred
compensation obligation to employees changes accordingly. However, the value of the related investment trust assets also
changes by an equal and offsetting amount, leaving no net cost to the Company. Under the new presentation, changes in the Company’s employee deferred compensation obligations remain in selling, general and administrative expenses or, in the case of risk consulting and internal audit services, costs of services. However, the offsetting changes in the investment trust assets will be presented separately below selling, general and administrative expenses. This does not change the previously reported levels of pre-tax or after-tax income or cash flow. Under the new presentation, we replaced the discussion of consolidated operating income with the non-GAAP measure of combined segment income. This is calculated as consolidated income before income taxes adjusted for net interest income and amortization of intangible assets, and is equal to the sum of segment income.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The financial results of the Company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and the rules of the SEC. To help readers understand the Company’s financial performance, the Company supplements its GAAP financial results with the following non-GAAP measures: as adjusted revenue growth rates and combined segment income.
Variations in the Company’s financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, billing days, and certain intercompany adjustments. The Company provides “as adjusted” revenue growth calculations to remove the impact of these items. These calculations show the year-over-year revenue growth rates for the Company’s reportable segments on both a reported basis and also on an as adjusted basis for global, U.S. and international operations. The Company has provided this data because it focuses on the Company’s revenue growth rates attributable to operating activities and aids in evaluating revenue trends over time. The Company expresses year-over-year revenue changes as calculated percentages using the same number of billing days and constant currency exchange rates.
In order to calculate constant currency revenue growth rates, as reported amounts are retranslated using foreign currency
exchange rates from the prior year’s comparable period. Management then calculates a global, weighted-average number of
billing days for each reporting period based upon input from all countries and all lines of business. In order to remove the
fluctuations caused by comparable periods having different billing days, the Company calculates same billing day revenue
growth rates by dividing each comparative period’s reported revenues by the calculated number of billing days for that period
to arrive at a per billing day amount. Same billing day growth rates are then calculated based upon the per billing day amounts.
The term “as adjusted” means that the impact of different billing days and constant currency fluctuations are removed from the
revenue growth rate calculation.
Combined segment income is defined as income before income taxes adjusted for net interest income and amortization of intangible assets, and is equal to the sum of segment income. The Company provides combined segment income because it is
how the Company evaluates segment performance. A reconciliation of combined segment income to reported income before
income taxes is provided herein.
The non-GAAP financial measures provided herein may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company’s industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to actual revenue growth derived from revenue amounts presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of the as adjusted revenue growth rates to the reported revenue growth rates is provided herein.
