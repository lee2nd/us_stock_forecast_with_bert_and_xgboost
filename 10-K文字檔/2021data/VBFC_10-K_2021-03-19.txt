Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of financial condition and results of operations
The following discussion is intended to assist readers in understanding and evaluating the financial condition, changes in financial condition and the results of operations of the Company, consisting of the parent company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained elsewhere in this report.
Caution About Forward-Looking Statements
In addition to historical information, this report may contain forward-looking statements. For this purpose, any statement, that is not a statement of historical fact may be deemed to be a forward-looking statement. These forward-looking statements may include statements regarding profitability, liquidity, allowance for loan losses, interest rate sensitivity, market risk, growth strategy and financial and other goals. Forward-looking statements often use words such as “believes,” “expects,” “plans,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “anticipates,” “forecasts,” “intends” or other words of similar meaning.

General
The Company’s primary source of earnings is net interest income and income from mortgage banking activities, and its principal market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The Company is not able to predict market interest rate fluctuations and its asset/liability management strategy may not prevent interest rate changes from having a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.
Although we endeavor to minimize the credit risk inherent in the Company’s loan portfolio, we must necessarily make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio based on our experience and evaluation of economic conditions. If such assumptions or judgments prove to be incorrect, the current allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover loan losses and additions to the allowance may be necessary, which would have a negative impact on net income.
Response to COVID-19
As the circumstances with the COVID-19 pandemic began to unfold, the Company rapidly mobilized over 80% of non-branch team members to work-from-home, went to drive-thru only at our branches with lobby access by appointment, and actively worked with borrowers to defer loan payments to allow operations to return to some level of normalcy. With the continued uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to take the necessary measures to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees and customers as well as working with our borrowers who continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to believe that we are well positioned to weather the economic storm created by the COVID-19 pandemic and have built the balance sheet around a philosophy of prudent risk taking.
Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program
The Company was successful in getting SBA PPP funds out to our community under the CARE Act, which was designed to protect jobs and provide economic relief to small businesses that were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Through December 31, 2020, the Bank had funded approximately $185 million in PPP loans, which provided essential funds to over 1,500 businesses and nonprofits and protected more than 20,000 jobs in our community. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank had submitted 413 applications to the SBA for forgiveness totaling $63,251,000 and received proceeds of approximately $47,987,000 on 345 of those applications. The Bank is participating in the second round of PPP funding approved by Congress and signed into law by the President of the United States of America on December 27, 2020. The Bank expects the approval for forgiveness on PPP loans to pick up in the first half of 2021. This will result in the recognition of unamortized deferred fee income, net of deferred cost, associated with the PPP loans to occur at a higher rate in the first half of 2021 when compared to the second half of 2020.
Supporting customers through payment deferrals
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we began deferring payments for up to six months for impacted customers under the CARES Act, as amended by the CAA, which permits financial institutions to suspend requirements under GAAP for loan modifications to borrowers affected by COVID-19 that would otherwise be characterized as TDRs and suspend any determination related thereto if (i) the loan modification is made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the end of the COVID-19 emergency declaration and (ii) the applicable loan was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019. In addition, federal bank regulatory authorities have issued guidance to encourage financial institutions to make loan modifications for borrowers affected by COVID-19 and have assured financial institutions that they will neither receive supervisory criticism for such prudent loan modifications, nor be required by examiners to automatically categorize COVID-19-related loan modifications as TDRs. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $38.0 million in loans still under their modified terms. The Company’s modification program primarily included payment deferrals and interest only modifications. Below is a breakdown of the loan portfolio showing the percentage of loans deferred in each category at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):
(1) The table excludes PPP loans of $136,674 as the inclusion of these loans dilutes the impact of the deferral program.
(2) The SBA provided a financial reprieve to small business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The SBA automatically paid the principal, interest, and fees on current SBA 7(a) loans for a period of six months. These loans have been excluded from the September 30, 2020 metrics; however, as of December 31, 2020, six loans with a total outstanding balance of $3,407,000 went into a deferred payment status and were included in the deferred loan amount above.
Below is a breakdown of the loan portfolio showing the percentage of loans in deferral within select industry categories at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):
(1) The SBA provided a financial reprieve to small business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The SBA automatically paid the principal, interest, and fees on current SBA 7(a) loans for a period of six months. These loans have been excluded from the September 30, 2020 metrics; however, as of December 31, 2020, six loans with a total outstanding balance of $3,407,000 went into a deferred payment status and were included in the deferred loan amount and number above.
(2) Loans within this group include business such as grocery, convenience stores, drug stores, consumer durables, apparel, and personal services.
Liquidity Risk Management
Over the past eight years, the Company has worked to fund the balance sheet with core deposits and reserve wholesale funding capacity for short periods of rapid loan growth or for crises such as the current economic environment.
During the three month period ended March 31, 2020, the Company took aggressive measures to bolster its liquidity to ensure it could meet customer demands in the event customers made significant deposit withdrawals and fully drew on lines of credit. The Company increased liquid assets by $20,155,000, or 30.12% from $66,904,000 at December 31, 2019 to $87,059,000 at March 31, 2020 which was partially accomplished by raising an additional $3,733,000 in internet listing service time deposits, $15,000,000 in FHLB advances and $6,136,000 in brokered time deposits, which were at zero at December 31, 2019.
From March 31, 2020 through December 31, 2020, the Company did not experience excessive demand for deposit withdrawals or advances under lines of credit; however, the Company did experience significant growth in low cost relationship deposits (i.e. noninterest bearing, NOW, money market and savings). This growth in low cost relationship deposits was the result of the Company converting a significant portion of non-customer PPP loan applicants into customers and the migration of customer funds from time deposits into money market deposits during the periods. During this period, the Company acquired $45,120,000 in funds through the Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (“PPPLF”) to support the origination of PPP loans. As of December 31, 2020, the PPPLF totaled $41,529,000. As a result of the growth in low cost relationship deposits, the Company prepaid its remaining $31,000,000 in FHLB advances during the three month period ended December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had on balance sheet liquid assets of $84,295,000, which the Company believes are sufficient to cover its current liquidity needs. However, if the need were to arise the Company could access liquidity of approximately $95,145,000 in the PPPLF through March 31, 2021, it could pledge additional collateral to the FHLB in order to increase its available borrowing capacity up to 25% of assets, it could access the two federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks totaling $15,000,000, and it could add additional funding through raising internet listing service and brokered time deposits. There were no borrowings with the FHLB or against the lines of credit at December 31, 2020.
Capital Risk Management
The Bank remains in a strong, well-capitalized position with a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 13.35%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 13.35%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 14.20% and a leverage ratio of 9.28% as of December 31, 2020. The most significant risk to capital as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic is the risk of default within our loan portfolio and the potential loan losses as a result of those defaults. The Company has taken several steps to mitigate this risk to our capital by building a diversified loan portfolio over the years to be capable of sustaining through a crisis, working with our customers during this time to defer loan payments for up to six months to allow time for economic stabilization and participating in the SBA PPP loan program to help provide much needed funds to our borrowers and the community. While there will be pressure on capital levels as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company believes the actions we are taking will protect our capital levels and allow the Company to support all stakeholders through this difficult time.
While the long-term economic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic are unknown at this time, we believe that our culture of disciplined and conservative risk taking across the balance sheet has the Company well positioned to not only carry through the current crisis but to be a pillar of support for our employees, our customers, and our communities.
Results of Operations
The following presents management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and results of operations for the Company for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Summary
The Company recorded net income of $8,554,000, or $5.86 per fully diluted share, in 2020, compared to net income of $4,477,000, or $3.10 per fully diluted share, in 2019.
Net interest income
Net interest income, which represents the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, is the Company’s primary source of earnings. Net interest income can be affected by changes in market interest rates as well as the level and composition of assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity. Net interest spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The net yield on interest-earning assets (“net interest margin”) is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Generally, the net interest margin will exceed the net interest spread because a portion of interest-earning assets are funded by various noninterest-bearing sources, principally noninterest-bearing deposits and shareholders’ equity.
Interest income on earning assets increased by $2,339,000 compared to the same period in 2019 as a result of the following:
· During 2020, the Company originated $185,137,000 in PPP loans which resulted in SBA fees of $6,584,000. The SBA fee is being amortized, based on the term of the loan through net income, net of $1,052,000 in deferred costs associated with the origination of the PPP loans. The recognition of the fees, net of deferred costs, will be accelerated as loans are forgiven by the SBA. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank had recognized through interest income $2,762,000 in SBA fee income, net of deferred costs as a result of normal amortization and the receipt of $47,987,000 in funds from loans forgiven by the SBA.
· The yield on average earning assets contracted by 63 basis points to 4.12% for the year-ended December 31, 2020 vs. 4.75% for the year-ended December 31, 2019, primarily because of the 150 basis points Federal Reserve rate cut in March 2020 and the significant level of PPP loans originated by the Bank during 2020.
Interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities decreased by $897,000 compared to the same period in 2019 as a result of the following:
· The cost of interest bearing liabilities dropped by 42 basis points to 1.05% for the year-ended December 31, 2020 compared to 1.48% for the year-ended December 31, 2019, as a result of the Company’s continued efforts to build low cost relationship deposits and its disciplined approach to deposit pricing. Low cost relationship deposits grew by $86,372,000, or 49.42%, from December 31, 2019, while higher cost time deposits decreased by $32,275,000, or 23.52%, from December 31, 2019.
The following table illustrates average balances of total interest-earning assets and total interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated, showing the average distribution of assets, liabilities, shareholders' equity and related income, expense and corresponding weighted-average yields and rates (dollars in thousands). The average balances used in these tables and other statistical data were calculated using daily average balances. We have no tax exempt assets for the periods presented.
Average Balance Sheets, Income and Expense, Yields and Rates
Interest income and interest expense are affected by changes in both average interest rates and average volumes of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The following table analyzes changes in net interest income attributable to changes in the volume of interest-sensitive assets and liabilities compared to changes in interest rates. Nonaccrual loans are included in average loans outstanding. The changes in interest due to both rate and volume have been allocated to changes due to volume and changes due to rate in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the changes in each (dollars in thousands).
Provision for loan losses
The amount of the loan loss provision is determined by an evaluation of the level of loans outstanding, the level of nonperforming loans, historical loan loss experience, delinquency trends, underlying collateral values, the amount of actual losses charged to the reserve in a given period and assessment of present and anticipated economic conditions.
The level of the allowance reflects changes in the size of the portfolio or in any of its components as well as management’s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations, specific credit risks, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, and present economic, political and regulatory conditions. Portions of the allowance may be allocated for specific credits; however, the entire allowance is available for any credit that, in management’s judgment, should be charged off. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond the Company’s control, including the performance of the Company’s loan portfolio, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward loan classifications.
The Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $950,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of growth in the loan portfolio and an increase in the qualitative factors due to the anticipated economic impact of COVID-19. The increase in the qualitative factors due to COVID-19 were a result of deterioration in local economic factors such as the higher levels of unemployment and the increased credit risk due to loan payment deferrals under the CARES Act. The Company believes the current level of allowance for loan loss reserves are adequate to cover incurred losses. However, the full economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains unknown and the Company will continue to monitor the loan portfolio for indicators that would warrant additional provisions for loan losses through 2021 and beyond. The Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $135,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 because of an increase in the specific reserves associated with a relationship evaluated individually for impairment.
For more financial data and other information about the provision for loan losses refer to section, “Balance Sheet Analysis” under this Item 7 - “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, and Note 4 “Allowance for Loan Losses” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Noninterest income
Noninterest income includes service charges and fees on deposit accounts, fee income related to loan origination, gains and losses on sale of mortgage loans and securities held for sale. The most significant noninterest income item has been mortgage banking income, net of commissions, representing 79% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 64% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
· The increase in mortgage banking income, net is a result of increased loan originations and sales compared to the prior year due to the low rate environment.
· The Company sold approximately $8,000,000 and $6,500,000 in investment securities resulting in a net gain of $12,000 and $101,000 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
· The Company made the decision not to sell any SBA loan guarantee strips after the first quarter of 2020 which resulted in the recognition of $86,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the recognition of $288,000 gain on sale for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Noninterest expense
Noninterest expense includes all expenses of the Company with the exception of interest expense on deposits and borrowings, provision for loan losses and income taxes. Some of the primary components of noninterest expense are salaries and benefits, occupancy and equipment costs and professional and outside services. Over the last two years, the most significant noninterest expense item has been salaries and benefits, representing 62% and 60% of noninterest expense in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
· The increase in salaries and benefits expense of $679,000 was primarily driven by an increase in expenses related to mortgage production, as well as an increase in employee count to support several initiatives including expanding treasury management services, supporting information technology growth, and resources supporting PPP loan administration. These increases were offset by the deferral of $1,052,000 in salary and benefits costs associated with the origination of over 1,500 PPP loans during 2020. The deferred costs will be recognized over the life of the PPP loans as a component of interest income along with the origination fees. This level of deferred costs is not expected to be recognized in future quarters and the recognition of the deferred costs and fees will accelerate as PPP loans are forgiven or repaid.
· The decrease in foreclosed assets, net expense was the result of the sale of two foreclosed properties resulting in a gain of $175,000 during 2020.
· The increase in the FDIC insurance premium is related to the receipt of the small bank credit from the FDIC during 2019.
· The Loss on debt extinguishment during 2020 was the result of the Company prepaying the $31,000,000 outstanding of its FHLB advances during three month period ended December 31, 2020. This pre-payment resulted in the recognition of approximately $696,000 in prepayment fees. The pre-payment of the advances will save the Company approximately $983,000 in interest expense over the remaining life of those advances, and will save approximately $519,000 in interest expense during 2021.
Income taxes
The Company’s effective tax rate, income tax as a percent of pre-tax income, may vary significantly from the statutory rate due to permanent difference and available tax credits. Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, was $2,485,000 and $1,164,000, respectively, resulting in an effective tax rate of 22.5% and 20.6%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily related to a reduction in the tax credit received related to state taxes attributed to the Company and the mortgage banking segment. The Bank is not subject to Virginia income taxes, and instead is subject to a franchise tax based on bank capital.
The Company has a net deferred tax asset which is included in other assets on the balance sheet. For more financial data and other information about income taxes refer to Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 9 “Income Taxes” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Balance Sheet Analysis
Investment securities
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, all of our investment securities were classified as available for sale.
For more financial data and other information about investment securities refer to Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 2 “Investment Securities Available for Sale” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Loans
One of management’s objectives is to improve the quality of the loan portfolio. The Company seeks to achieve this objective by maintaining rigorous underwriting standards coupled with regular evaluation of the creditworthiness of and the designation of lending limits for each borrower. The portfolio strategies include seeking industry, loan type and loan size diversification in order to minimize credit concentration risk. Management also focuses on originating loans in markets with which the Company is familiar.
Approximately 62% of all loans are secured by mortgages on real property located principally in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Approximately 5% of the loan portfolio consists of rehabilitated student loans purchased by the Bank from 2014 to 2017 (see discussion following). The Company’s commercial and industrial loan portfolio represents approximately 32% of all loans. Loans in this category are typically made to individuals and small and medium-sized businesses, and range between $250,000 and $2.5 million. Based on underwriting standards, commercial and industrial loans may be secured in whole or in part by collateral such as liquid assets, accounts receivable, equipment, inventory, and real property. The collateral securing any loan may depend on the type of loan and may vary in value based on market conditions. The remainder of our loan portfolio is in consumer loans which represent less than 1% of the total.
The following tables present the composition of our loan portfolio at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands).
The Bank originated $185,137,000 in PPP loans as of December 31, 2020. These loans have provided essential funds to approximately 1,500 businesses and nonprofits and protected more than 20,000 jobs in our community. The Bank is participating in the second round of PPP funding approved by Congress and signed into law by the President of the United States of America on December 27, 2020. The processing fees earned on the PPP loans will help to support the Bank’s loan deferral program and potential credit losses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Below is a breakdown of PPP loans by loan size as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):
For more financial data and other information about loans refer to Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 3 “Loans” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Allowance for loan losses
We monitor and maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb an estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. For more financial data and other information about loans refer to Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 4 “Allowance for Loan Losses” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Asset quality
The following table summarizes asset quality information at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands).
(1) All loans 90 days past due and still accruing are rehabilitated student loans which have a 98% guarantee by the DOE.
(2) Loans are net of unearned income and deferred cost.
Nonperforming assets totaled $1,913,000 at December 31, 2020, compared to $2,394,000 at December 31, 2019. Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of $1,577,000 in nonaccrual loans, compared to $1,868,000 at December 31, 2019
The following table presents an analysis of the changes in nonperforming assets for 2020 (in thousands).
Nonperforming restructured loans are included in nonaccrual loans. Until a nonperforming restructured loan has performed in accordance with its restructured terms for a minimum of six months, it will remain on nonaccrual status.
Interest is accrued on outstanding loan principal balances, unless the Company considers collection to be doubtful. Commercial and unsecured consumer loans are designated as nonaccrual when the Company considers collection of expected principal and interest doubtful. Mortgage loans and most other types of consumer loans past due 90 days or more may remain on accrual status if management determines that concern over our ability to collect principal and interest is not significant. When loans are placed in nonaccrual status, previously accrued and unpaid interest is reversed against interest income in the current period and interest is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash is received. Interest accruals are resumed on such loans only when in the judgment of management, the loans are estimated to be fully collectible as to both principal and interest.
There were no specific allowances associated with the total nonaccrual loans of $1,577,000 at December 31, 2020 that were considered impaired. This compares to $1,868,000 in nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2019 of which one loan had specific allowances for loan losses of $135,000. This loan was charged off during 2020.
Cumulative interest income that would have been recorded had nonaccrual loans been performing would have been $84,000 and $136,000 for 2020 and 2019, respectively. Student loans totaling $2,193,000 and $2,567,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were past due 90 days or more and interest was still being accrued as principal and interest on such loans have a 98% guarantee by the DOE. The 2% not covered by the DOE guarantee is provided for in the allowance for loan losses.
Deposits
The following table gives the composition of our deposits at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands).
Total deposits increased by $145,174,000, or 32.76%, from December 31, 2019. Variances of note are as follows:
· Noninterest bearing demand account balances increased $91,077,000 from December 31, 2019, and represented 37.78% of total deposits at December 31, 2020 compared to 29.61% as of December 31, 2019. The increase in noninterest bearing deposits from December 31, 2019 was primarily a result of the Bank converting a significant portion of non-customer PPP loan applicants into customers.
· Low cost relationship deposits (i.e. interest checking, money market, and savings) balances increased $86,372,000, or 49.42%, from December 31, 2019. The increase in these accounts during 2020 was primarily a result of continued growth in accounts from non-customer PPP loan applicants and the migration of customer funds from time deposits.
· Time deposits decreased by $32,275,000, or 23.52%, from December 31, 2019. The decrease in time deposits was a result of our disciplined approached to deposit pricing to reduce our overall cost of funds and the migration of customers from time deposits to lower cost deposit products.
The variety of deposit accounts that we offer has allowed us to be competitive in obtaining funds and has allowed us to respond with flexibility to, although not to eliminate, the threat of disintermediation (the flow of funds away from depository institutions such as banking institutions into direct investment vehicles such as government and corporate securities). Our ability to attract and retain deposits, and our cost of funds, has been, and is expected to continue to be, significantly affected by money market conditions.
Borrowings
The Company prepaid all $31 million of its outstanding FHLB advances during the three month period ended December 31, 2020. This pre-payment resulted in the recognition of a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $696,000. The pre-payment of the advances will save the Company approximately $983,000 in interest expense over the remaining life of those advances, and will save approximately $519,000 in interest expense during 2021.
We utilize borrowings to supplement deposits to address funding or liability duration needs. For more financial data and other information about borrowings refer to Note 8 “Borrowings” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Off-balance sheet arrangements
The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. For more financial data and other information about loans refer to Note 12 “Commitments and Contingencies” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Capital resources
Shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2020 was $51,996,000, compared to $42,914,000 at December 31, 2019. The $9,082,000 increase in shareholders’ equity during 2020 is primarily due to net income for the year of $8,554,000.
The following table presents the composition of regulatory capital and the capital ratios for the Bank at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands).

Liquidity
Liquidity represents the ability of a company to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss, and the ability to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities. Liquidity management involves monitoring our sources and uses of funds in order to meet our day-to-day cash flow requirements while maximizing profits. Liquidity management is made more complicated because different balance sheet components are subject to varying degrees of management control. For example, the timing of maturities of our investment portfolio is fairly predictable and subject to a high degree of control at the time investment decisions are made. However, net deposit inflows and outflows are far less predictable and are not subject to the same degree of control.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our liquid assets, consisting of cash, cash equivalents and investment securities available for sale, totaled $84,295,000 and $66,904,000, or 11.94% and 12.38% of total assets, respectively. Investment securities traditionally provide a secondary source of liquidity since they can be converted into cash in a timely manner.
Our holdings of liquid assets plus the ability to maintain and expand our deposit base and borrowing capabilities serve as our principal sources of liquidity. We plan to meet our future cash needs through the liquidation of temporary investments, the generation of deposits, and from additional borrowings. In addition, we will receive cash upon the maturity and sale of loans and the maturity of investment securities. We maintain two federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks totaling $15 million for which there were no borrowings against at December 31, 2020 and $5,317,000 borrowings against the lines at December 31, 2019.
We are also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (“FHLB”), from which applications for borrowings can be made. The FHLB requires that securities, qualifying mortgage loans, and stock of the FHLB owned by the Bank be pledged to secure any advances from the FHLB. The unused borrowing capacity currently available from the FHLB at December 31, 2020 was $50.3 million, based on the Bank's qualifying collateral available to secure any future borrowings. However, we are able to pledge additional collateral to the FHLB in order to increase our available borrowing capacity up to 25% of assets.
We also have access to the Federal Reserve’s PPPLF, from which applications for borrowings can be made. The Federal Reserve requires that PPP loans be pledged to secure any advances from the PPPLF. The Company currently has $41,529,000 in borrowings against the PPPLF and an unused borrowing capacity of $95,145,000 based on unpledged PPP loans available to secure any future borrowings. The Company has access to this facility until March 31, 2021 at which time the Federal Reserve will no longer take requests for borrowings.
Liquidity provides us with the ability to meet normal deposit withdrawals, while also providing for the credit needs of customers. We are committed to maintaining liquidity at a level sufficient to protect depositors, provide for reasonable growth, and fully comply with all regulatory requirements.
At December 31, 2020, we had commitments to originate $150,974,000 of loans. Fixed commitments to incur capital expenditures were approximately $400,000 at December 31, 2020. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature or reprice in the 12-month period ending December 31, 2021 total $75,413,000. We believe that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us. We further believe that deposit growth, loan repayments and other sources of funds will be adequate to meet our foreseeable short-term and long-term liquidity needs.
Interest Rate Sensitivity
An important element of asset/liability management is the monitoring of our sensitivity to interest rate movements. In order to measure the effects of interest rates on our net interest income, management takes into consideration the expected cash flows from the securities and loan portfolios and the expected magnitude of the repricing of specific asset and liability categories. We evaluate interest sensitivity risk and then formulate guidelines to manage this risk based on management’s outlook regarding the economy, forecasted interest rate movements and other business factors. Our goal is to maximize and stabilize the net interest margin by limiting exposure to interest rate changes.
Contractual principal repayments of loans do not necessarily reflect the actual term of our loan portfolio. The average lives of mortgage loans are substantially less than their contractual terms because of loan prepayments and because of enforcement of due-on-sale clauses, which gives us the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event, among other things, the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid. In addition, certain borrowers increase their equity in the security property by making payments in excess of those required under the terms of the mortgage.
The sale of fixed rate loans is intended to protect us from precipitous changes in the general level of interest rates. The valuation of adjustable rate mortgage loans is not as directly dependent on the level of interest rates as is the value of fixed rate loans. As with other investments, we regularly monitor the appropriateness of the level of adjustable rate mortgage loans in our portfolio and may decide from time to time to sell such loans and reinvest the proceeds in other adjustable rate investments.
Impact of inflation and changing prices
The Company’s financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require the Company to measure financial position and operating results primarily in terms of historical dollars. Changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered. The primary effect of inflation on the operations of the Company is reflected in increased operating costs. In management’s opinion, changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate. While interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate, they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of the Company, including changes in the expected rate of inflation, the influence of general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government, its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities.
LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates
Following the announcement by the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority in July 2017 that it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for LIBOR after 2021, central banks and regulators around the world have commissioned working groups to find suitable replacements for Interbank Offered Rates (“IBOR”) and other benchmark rates and to implement financial benchmark reforms more generally. These actions have resulted in uncertainty regarding the use of alternative reference rates (“ARRs”) and could cause disruptions in a variety of markets, as well as adversely impact our business, operations and financial results.
To facilitate an orderly transition from IBORs and other benchmark rates to ARRs, the Company has established a company-wide initiative led by senior management. The objective of this initiative is to identify and assess the Company’s exposure and develop an appropriate action plan to address this exposure prior to transition.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
General
The accounting and reporting policies of the Company and the Bank are in accordance with GAAP and conform to general practices within the banking industry. The Company’s financial position and results of operations are affected by management’s application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities, and amounts reported for revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the Company’s consolidated financial position and/or results of operations.
The more critical accounting and reporting policies include the Company’s accounting for the allowance for loan losses and income taxes. The Company’s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding the Company’s consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, the Company’s significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
The following is a summary of the Company’s critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions, and judgments.
Allowance for loan losses
We monitor and maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb an estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. We maintain policies and procedures that address the systems of controls over the following areas of maintenance of the allowance: the systematic methodology used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance to provide assurance they are maintained in accordance with GAAP; the accounting policies for loan charge-offs and recoveries; the assessment and measurement of impairment in the loan portfolio; and the loan grading system.
The allowance reflects management’s best estimate of probable losses within the existing loan portfolio and of the risk inherent in various components of the loan portfolio, including loans identified as impaired as required by Financial Accounting Standards Board Codification Topic 310: Receivables. Loans evaluated individually for impairment include nonperforming loans, such as loans on nonaccrual, loans past due by 90 days or more, restructured loans and other loans selected by management. The evaluations are based upon discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations. If the evaluation shows that a loan is individually impaired, then a specific reserve is established for the amount of impairment.
Loans are grouped by similar characteristics, including the type of loan, the assigned loan classification and the general collateral type. A loss rate reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon historical net charge-off rates, the predominant collateral type for the group and the terms of the loan. The resulting estimate of losses for groups of loans is adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans and leases, including: borrower and industry concentrations; levels and trends in delinquencies, charge-offs and recoveries; changes in underwriting standards and risk selection; level of experience, ability and depth of lending management; and national and local economic conditions.
The amounts of estimated impairment for individually evaluated loans and groups of loans are added together for a total estimate of loan losses. This estimate of losses is compared to our allowance for loan losses as of the evaluation date and, if the estimate of losses is greater than the allowance, an additional provision to the allowance would be made. If the estimate of losses is less than the allowance, the degree to which the allowance exceeds the estimate is evaluated to determine whether the allowance falls outside a range of estimates. We recognize the inherent imprecision in estimates of losses due to various uncertainties and variability related to the factors used, and therefore a reasonable range around the estimate of losses is derived and evaluated by management. If different assumptions or conditions were to prevail and it is determined that the allowance is not adequate to absorb the new estimate of probable losses, an additional provision for loan losses would be made, which amount may be material to the financial statements.
Income taxes
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. If current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance may be established. Management considers the determination of this valuation allowance to be a critical accounting policy due to the need to exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets, including projections of future taxable income. These judgments and estimates are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets may be required if the amounts of taxes recoverable through loss carry forwards decline, or if management projects lower levels of future taxable income.
