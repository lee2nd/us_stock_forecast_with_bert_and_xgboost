Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report. In addition to the historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.
Our Business
Enochian BioSciences, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative platforms for gene-modified cellular and immune therapies to potentially cure and treat deadly diseases. The company’s gene-modified cell and immune therapy platforms can potentially be applied to multiple indications, including HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B, all Corona and Influenza viruses, and Oncology.
To date, our operations have been funded by sales of our securities and debt financing. We have never generated any sales revenue and we expect this to continue until our therapies or products are approved for marketing in the United States and/or Europe. Even if we are successful in having our therapies or products approved for sale in the United States and/or Europe, we cannot guarantee that a market for the therapies or products will develop. We may never be profitable.
Recent Developments
On August 11, 2021, and with an effective date of July 1, 2021, the Company and Dr. Dybul entered into an Employment Agreement, the form of which was approved and recommended by the Board on October 30, 2019 and approved by stockholders of the Company with a majority of the voting power of all shares of the Company’s capital stock entitled to vote on the matter on October 31, 2019. The material terms of the Employment Agreement are as set forth in the Company’s Information Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 12, 2019.
COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and to date has led to the implementation of various mitigation responses, including government-imposed quarantines, travel restrictions and other public health safety measures, as well as leading to reported adverse impacts on healthcare resources, facilities and providers across the United States and in other countries. COVID-19 may cause delays in our research activities. To date, it has not materially affected our operations; however it has caused delays in the conduct of experiments due to limitations of various organizations, in particular those conducting experiments related to COVID-19. There have also been increases in the cost to conduct animal studies due to staffing and other limitations.
The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business and operations is subject to future developments, which are uncertain and difficult to predict. Further quarantines, shelter-in-place or similar restrictions and other actions taken or imposed by foreign, federal, state and local governments could adversely impact our or our partners’ clinical, research and development, regulatory and manufacturing operations or timelines.
We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations and will seek to adjust our activities as appropriate. In addition, the pandemic could result in significant and prolonged disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect the financial resources available to us.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Year ended June 30, 2021 compared to the year ended June 30, 2020.
The following table sets forth our revenues, expenses and net income for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. The financial information below is derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Revenues
We are a pre-revenue, pre-clinical biotechnology company. We have never generated revenues and have incurred losses since inception. We do not anticipate earning any revenues until our therapies or products are approved for marketing and sale.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were $23,401,787 and $11,923,768, respectively, representing an increase of $11,478,019, or 96%. The largest contributor to the increase in operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2021, was the increase in research and development expenses of $10,843,773 in connection with the continued growth in our research and development efforts, and an increase in general and administrative expenses of $619,295.
General and administrative expenses for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were $7,740,130 and $7,120,835, respectively, representing an increase of $619,295, or 9%. General and administrative expenses include audit fees, non-cash compensation expenses, consulting expenses, board compensation, filing fees, corporate taxes, security expenses, legal fees, office leases, insurance, patent fees, salaries, investor relations, travel expenses and other general and administrative expenses. The increase in general and administrative expenses are primarily related to increases of $416,076 in stock-based compensation, $254,512 in salaries, $179,363 related to insurance, and $99,880 in investor relations, partially offset by decreases in legal and security fees and laboratory costs totaling approximately $420,862.
Research and development expenses for the years ended June 30, 2021, and June 30, 2020, were $15,538,122 and $4,694,349, respectively, representing an increase of $10,843,773 or 231%. Overall research and development expenses remained consistent with the exception of the $10 million upfront fees related to the Coronavirus and Influenza License Agreement discussed above, and approximately $657,000 in collaboration partner costs in the development of our product lines ENOB-HV-12 and DC-11 in the year ended June 30, 2021.
Other Income (Expense)
Net other income (expense) for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was $(3,447,096) and $507,410, respectively, representing an increase of 3,954,506 or 779%. The increase in other expense was due primarily to the change in the fair value of contingent consideration of $3,322,000, which is impacted by contingent shares issued during the period and the mark to market adjustments on the remaining contingent consideration liability, as well as an increase in interest expense of approximately $275,000.
Net Loss
Net loss for the years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 was $26,723,607 and $11,416,358, respectively, representing an increase in net loss of $15,307,249, or 134%. The increase in net loss was primarily due to the upfront fees of $10 million related to the Coronavirus and Influenza License Agreement recorded in research and development costs, an approximate increase in the change in fair value of contingent consideration of $3,332,599 and $619,295 increase in general and administrative expenses.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have historically satisfied our capital and liquidity requirements through funding from shareholders, the sale of our Common Stock and warrants, and debt financing. We have never generated any sales revenue to support our operations and we expect this to continue until our therapies or products are approved for marketing in the United States and/or Europe. Even if we are successful in having our therapies or products approved for sale in the United States and/or Europe, we cannot guarantee that a market for the therapies or products will develop. We may never be profitable.
At this time, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and access to committed funds to fund our operations for the next twelve months. We may need additional funds for (a) the purchase of equipment, (b) increases in personnel, and, (c) research and development, specifically to advance towards an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) following Pre-IND readouts from the FDA for ENOB CV-01, ENOB-HB-01, ENOB-HV-01, and ENOB-HV-21. We will also require additional funding to continue our research and development of ENOB-HV11/12 and ENOB-DC11 and ENOB-FL-01 and -11 and ENOB-CV-11, to fund the Coronavirus and Influenza Indications License Agreement in furtherance of the treatment related to all coronaviruses, and for possible future strategic acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies complementary to our business. If additional funds are required, we may raise such funds from time to time through public or private sales of our equity or debt securities. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could materially adversely affect our growth plans and our financial condition and results of operations.
As of June 30, 2021, the Company had $20,664,410 in cash and working capital of $19,013,100 as compared to $8,696,361 in cash and working capital of $7,606,411 as of June 30, 2020. The increase in cash of $11,968,049 is primarily due to the proceeds from the various equity raises throughout the year that totaled approximately $33,066,148, partially offset by the cost of operations primarily related to research and development costs of $15,500,000 (see Note 8 of the Financial Statements.)
Equity
On July 8, 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement (the “LPC Purchase Agreement”) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC, (“LPC”), pursuant to which LPC is committed to buy, and we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell to LPC up to an aggregate of $20,000,000 of our Common Stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the LPC Purchase Agreement, including a limitation on the number of shares of Common Stock we can put to LPC and the pricing parameters for the sales. For the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company issued 200,000 shares of Common Stock for proceeds of $1,221,350 (see Note 7 of the Financial Statements.)
Pursuant to a private placement offering, the Company issued 1,275,719 shares of Common Stock resulting in proceeds of $5,000,800. The Company effected the issuances of the shares of Common Stock from March 15, 2021 to June 9, 2021. The private placement was made directly by the Company in reliance upon Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933. No underwriter or placement agent was engaged by the Company for this private placement (see Note 7 of the Financial Statements.)
On June 14, 2021, the Company and certain institutional investors entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to such investors an aggregate of 3,866,668 shares of Common Stock, in a registered direct offering, for gross proceeds of approximately $29 million (the “Financing”). The purchase price for each share of Common Stock was $7.50. The Company agreed not to issue or enter into any agreement to issue Common Stock from June 14, 2021 until ninety (90) days after the closing of the Financing. The Company entered into a letter agreement dated June 14, 2021 (the “Letter Agreement”) with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC, as exclusive placement agent (the “Placement Agent”), pursuant to which the Placement Agent agreed to act as the exclusive placement agent for the Financing. The Company agreed to pay the Placement Agent an aggregate fee equal to 7.0% of the gross proceeds raised in the Financing. The Company also agreed to pay the Placement Agent certain expenses. The Company paid $2,090,000 in commissions and incurred offering expenses, and issuance costs of $66,011, resulting in net proceeds of $26,843,999 in connection with the Financing. The Financing closed on June 16, 2021 (see Note 7 of the Financial Statements.)
Warrant Exercises
On July 3, 2019, certain of our warrant holders exercised warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of Common Stock for total proceeds to the Company of $1,000,000. For the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company issued 63,122 shares of Common Stock for total proceeds of $82,056 upon the exercise of warrants.
Debt
On February 6, 2020, the Company issued two Convertible Notes (the “Convertible Notes”) to an existing stockholder of the Company each with a face value amount of $600,000, convertible into shares of Common Stock. The holder did not exercise the conversion feature that expired on February 6, 2021. The outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Notes is due and payable on February 6, 2023. Interest on the Convertible Notes commenced accruing on the date of issuance at six percent (6%) per annum, computed on the basis of twelve 30-day months, and is compounded monthly on the final day of each calendar month based upon the principal and all accrued and unpaid interest outstanding as of such compound date. The interest is payable in cash on a semi-annual basis. For the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the interest expense amounted to $72,967 and $30,302, respectively (see Note 5 to the Financial Statements.)
On March 30, 2020 (the “Issuance Date”), the Company issued a Promissory Note in the principal amount of $5,000,000 (the “Unsecured Note”) to Paseco APS (the “Holder”), a Danish limited company and an existing stockholder of the Company. The principal amount of the Unsecured Note will be payable on November 30, 2021, and bears interest at a fixed rate of 6% per annum, which was prepaid by the Company in full on the date of issuance through the issuance of 188,485 shares of the Company’s Common Stock based on the closing market price on that date, valued at $501,370. On February 11, 2021, the Company and the Holder amended the original Unsecured Note to extend the maturity date to November 30, 2022. The Company prepaid in full all accrued interest from November 30, 2021 to the new maturity date November 30, 2022, through the issuance of 74,054 shares of Common Stock based on the closing market price on that date, valued at $299,178. (See Note 5 to the Financial Statements).
Cash Flows
Year ended June 30, 2021 compared to the year ended June 30, 2020
Following is a summary of the Company’s cash flows provided by (used by) operating, investing, and financing activities:
At June 30, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $20,664,410, an increase of $11,968,049, when compared to the June 30, 2020 balance of $8,696,361. This increase was primarily due to cash provided by financing activities, primarily from equity sale transactions, partially offset by cash used in operating activities.
We plan to use our cash and cash equivalents to fund research and development, specifically to open an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) (the first step in the drug review process by the FDA) for ENOB CV-01, ENOB-HB01, ENOB-HV01, and ENOB-HV21, to continue our research and development of ENOB-HV11/12 and ENOB-DC11, and to fund the Coronavirus and Influenza Indications License Agreement in furtherance of the Treatment, and possible future strategic acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies complementary to our business. These activities will require an increase in staffing and possible additional property, plant and equipment purchases to support the expected growth.
Cash used by operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net income for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used by operating activities for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was $20,610,723 and $10,459,422, respectively, representing an increase of $10,151,301. The increase is primarily related to the increase in our net loss as adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $932,133.
Net cash used by investing activities for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was $48,892 and $184,463, respectively, representing a decrease of $135,571. The decrease is primarily due to lower costs incurred in purchases of equipment in the current year.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was $32,601,553 and $7,200,000, respectively, representing an increase of $25,401,553. The net cash provided by financing activities in the current year consists primarily of $26,843,998 of net proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock as part of a direct offering, $5,000,800 of proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock through a private placement, and $1,221,350 proceeds from issuance of Common Stock related to equity line draws. The prior year net cash from financing activities primarily consisted of $1,200,000 related to a convertible note payable, $5,000,000 related to a long-term note payable, and $1,000,000 related to warrants exercised.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of June 30, 2021, and 2020, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. We are not aware of any material transactions, which are not disclosed in our consolidated financial statements.
Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Our most critical accounting estimates are detailed below, and our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Intangible Assets - The Company has both Definite and Indefinite life intangible assets.
Definite life intangible assets relate to patents. The Company accounts for definite life intangible assets in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Intangible assets are recorded at cost. Patent costs capitalized consist of costs incurred to acquire the underlying patent. If it is determined that a patent will not be issued, the related remaining capitalized patent costs are charged to expense. Definite life intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. The estimated useful life of patents is twenty years from the date of application.
Indefinite life intangible assets include license agreements and goodwill acquired in a business combination. The Company accounts for indefinite life intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, License agreement costs represent the fair value of the license agreement on the date acquired and are tested annually for impairment.
Goodwill - Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually as of June 30 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets - We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the operating segment level. Our detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit and is based on discounted cash flows or relative market-based approaches. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we record an impairment loss for such excess. The carrying value of IPR&D and goodwill at June 30, 2021, were $154,824,000 and $11,640,000, respectively.
For indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as licenses acquired as an IPR&D asset, on an annual basis we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment less, if any, for the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. The fair value analysis performed on the license agreement, and the annual fair value analysis performed on goodwill supported that both indefinite life intangible assets are not impaired as of June 30, 2021 (see Note 3.)
Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The Company accounts for fair value measurements for financial assets and financial liabilities in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820. Under the authoritative guidance, fair value is defined as the exit price, representing the amount that would either be received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the guidance established a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
● Level 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
● Level 2. Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and
● Level 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.
There were no assets that use Level 1, 2 or 3 inputs, nor any liabilities that use Level 1 or 2 inputs as of June 30, 2021.
Liabilities that use Level 3 inputs held as of June 30, 2021 consisted of a contingent consideration liability related to the February 16, 2018 acquisition of Enochian BioPharma Inc. (the “Acquisition”). As consideration for the Acquisition, the stockholders of Enochian Biopharma received (i) 18,081,962 shares of common stock, and (ii) the right to receive contingent shares pro rata upon the exercise of warrants, which were outstanding at closing. The contingent consideration liability was recorded at fair value of $21,516,000 at the time of the Acquisition and is subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. At June 30, 2021, 1,350,000 contingent shares are issuable in connection with the Acquisition.
The fair value of the contingent consideration liability is estimated using an option-pricing model. The key inputs to the model are all contractual or observable with the exception being volatility, which is computed based on the value of the Company’s underlying stock. The key inputs to valuing the contingent consideration liability on the date of acquisition and as of June 30, 2021 include the Company’s stock price, the exercise price of the warrants of $1.30 per share, the risk-free rate, the expected volatility of the Company’s common stock and the digital call rate. The fair value measurements are highly sensitive to changes in these inputs and significant changes in these inputs could result in a significantly higher or lower fair value.
Stock-Based Compensation - The Company has granted stock options, restricted share units (“RSUs”) and warrants to certain employees, officers, directors and consultants. The Company accounts for options in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. Stock based compensation costs for the vesting of options and RSUs granted to certain employees, officers, directors and consultants for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were $1,444,798 and $1,028,721, respectively (see Note 7 to the Financial Statements).
The Company recognizes compensation costs for stock option awards to employees, officers and directors based on their grant-date fair value. The value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model are the expected term of the award, the underlying stock price volatility, the risk-free interest rate and the expected dividend yield.
The Company records stock-based compensation for services received from non-employees in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation Non-Employees. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to consultants and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued and are recognized over the consultants’ required service period, which is generally the vesting period (see Note 7 to the Financial Statements.)
Recently Enacted Accounting Standards
