Executive Overview
Herman Miller’s purpose statement is design for the good of humankind. At present, most customers come to the Company for furnishing interior environments in corporate offices, healthcare settings, higher education institutions and residential spaces. The Company's primary products include furniture systems, seating, storage, freestanding furniture, healthcare environment products, casegoods, textiles and related technologies and services.
More than 100 years of innovative business practices and a commitment to social responsibility have established Herman Miller as a recognized global company. The Company trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol MLHR.
Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2021, the Company finalized the acquisition of Knoll, Inc. (“Knoll”) in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $1.8 billion. This combination brings together two pioneering and iconic brands to create MillerKnoll, one of the largest and most influential modern design companies in the world. Together we will transform our industry and redefine modern design. With a broader portfolio, global footprint, and advanced digital capabilities, our combined company will be poised to innovate and design the future for all the places where life happens.
Herman Miller's products are sold internationally through controlled subsidiaries or branches in various countries including the United Kingdom, Denmark, Canada, Japan, Mexico, Australia, Singapore, China, Hong Kong, India and Brazil. The Company's products are offered elsewhere in the world primarily through independent dealerships or joint ventures with customers in over 100 countries.
The Company is globally positioned in terms of manufacturing operations. In the United States, manufacturing operations are located in Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin and North Carolina. In Europe, the Company's manufacturing presence is located in the United Kingdom. Manufacturing operations globally also include facilities located in China, Brazil and India. The Company manufactures products using a system of lean manufacturing techniques collectively referred to as the Herman Miller Performance System (HMPS). For its contract furniture business, Herman Miller strives to maintain efficiencies and cost savings by minimizing the amount of inventory on hand. Accordingly, production is order-driven with direct materials and components purchased as needed to meet demand. The standard manufacturing lead time for the majority of our products is 10 to 20 days. These factors result in a high rate of inventory turns related to our manufactured inventories.
A key element of the Company's manufacturing strategy is to limit fixed production costs by sourcing component parts from strategic suppliers. This strategy has allowed the Company to increase the variable nature of its cost structure, while retaining proprietary control over those production processes that the Company believes provide a competitive advantage. As a result of this strategy, the Company's manufacturing operations are largely assembly-based.
A key element of the Company's growth strategy is to scale the Retail business through the Company's Design Within Reach (DWR), HAY and Herman Miller retail operations. The Retail business provides a channel to bring Herman Miller's iconic and design-centric products to retail customers, along with other proprietary and third-party products, with a focus on design. The Company continues to transform its Retail business through the DWR retail studio footprint, which will be complemented by a continued focus on improving margins through the development of exclusive product designs and leveraging additional sales in DWR's contract, catalog and digital channels, as well as the HAY brand, which was launched in North America in fiscal 2019.

•Portfolio of Leading Brands and Products - Herman Miller is a globally-recognized, design brand known for working with some of the most well-known and respected designers in the world. Over the years, it has evolved into Herman Miller Group, a family of brands that collectively offers a variety of products for environments where people live, learn, work, heal and play. Within the industries in which the Company operates, Herman Miller, DWR, Geiger, Maharam, POSH, Nemschoff, Colebrook Bosson Saunders ("CBS"), HAY, Maars Living Walls and naughtone are acknowledged as leading brands that inspire architects and designers to create their best design solutions. This portfolio has enabled Herman Miller to connect with new audiences, channels, geographies and product categories. Leveraging the collective brand equity of the Herman Miller Group across the lines of business is an important element of the Company's business strategy.

The Company believes its skills and experience in matching problem-solving design with the workplace needs of customers provide the Company with a competitive advantage in the marketplace. An important component of the Company's business strategy is to actively pursue a program of new product research, design and development. The Company accomplishes this through the use of an internal research and engineering staff that engages with third party design resources generally compensated on a royalty basis.
•Operational Excellence - The Company was among the first in the industry to embrace the concepts of lean manufacturing. HMPS provides the foundation for all the Company's manufacturing operations. The Company is committed to continuously improving both product quality and production and operational efficiency. The Company has extended this lean process work to its non-manufacturing processes as well as externally to its manufacturing supply chain and distribution channel. The Company believes these concepts hold significant promise for further gains in reliability, quality and efficiency.
