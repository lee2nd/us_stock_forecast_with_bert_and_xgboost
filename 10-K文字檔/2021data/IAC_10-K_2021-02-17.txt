Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
MTCH Separation:
On December 19, 2019, IAC/InterActiveCorp ("Old IAC") entered into a Transaction Agreement (as amended as of April 28, 2020 and June 22, 2020, the "Transaction Agreement") with Match Group, Inc. ("Old MTCH"), IAC Holdings, Inc. ("New IAC" or the "Company"), a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Old IAC, and Valentine Merger Sub LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Old IAC. On June 30, 2020, the businesses of Old MTCH were separated from the remaining businesses of Old IAC through a series of transactions that resulted in the pre-transaction stockholders of Old IAC owning shares in two, separate public companies-(1) Old IAC, which was renamed Match Group, Inc. ("New Match") and which owns the businesses of Old MTCH and certain Old IAC financing subsidiaries, and (2) New IAC, which was renamed IAC/InterActiveCorp, and which owns Old IAC's other businesses-and the pre-transaction stockholders of Old MTCH (other than Old IAC) owning shares in New Match. This transaction is referred to as the "MTCH Separation."
Spin-off:
On December 22, 2020, IAC announced that its Board of Directors approved a plan to spin-off its full stake in Vimeo to IAC shareholders. IAC's Vimeo business will be separated from the remaining businesses of IAC through a series of transactions (which we refer to as the “Spin-off”) that, if completed in their entirety, will result in the transfer of IAC's Vimeo business to Vimeo Holdings, Inc. ("SpinCo"), a newly formed subsidiary of IAC, with SpinCo becoming an independent, separately traded public company through a spin-off from IAC, and Vimeo, the IAC subsidiary that currently holds the Vimeo business, becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of SpinCo. The proposed transaction is subject to a number of conditions including final approval by IAC's Board of Directors, approval of the separation proposal by IAC stockholders, and other customary conditions and approvals and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021.

MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW
As used herein, "IAC," the "Company," "we," "our" or "us" and similar terms refer to IAC/InterActiveCorp and its subsidiaries (unless the context requires otherwise).
The Company operates Vimeo, Dotdash and Care.com, among many other online businesses, and has majority ownership of ANGI Homeservices, which operates HomeAdvisor, Angie’s List and Handy.
For a more detailed description of the Company's operating businesses, see "Description of IAC Businesses" included in "Item 1 - Business".
Sources of Revenue
ANGI revenue is primarily derived from (i) consumer connection revenue, which comprises fees paid by HomeAdvisor service professionals for consumer matches (regardless of whether the service professional ultimately provides the requested service), and revenue from completed jobs sourced through the HomeAdvisor and Handy platforms, and (ii) HomeAdvisor service professional membership subscription fees. Consumer connection revenue varies based upon several factors, including the service requested, product experience offered and geographic location of service. Revenue is also derived from (i) sales of time-based website, mobile and call center advertising to service professionals and (ii) membership subscription fees from consumers. Prior to January 1, 2020, ANGI's Handy business recorded revenue on a net basis. Effective January 1, 2020, ANGI modified the Handy terms and conditions so that Handy, rather than the service professional, has the contractual relationship with the consumer to deliver the service and Handy, rather than the consumer, has the contractual relationship with the service professional. Consumers request services and pay for such services directly through the Handy platform and then Handy fulfills the request with independently established home services providers engaged in a trade, occupation and/or business that customarily provides such services. This change in contractual terms requires gross revenue accounting treatment effective January 1, 2020. Also, in the case of certain tasks, HomeAdvisor provides a pre-priced product offering, pursuant to which consumers can request services through a HomeAdvisor platform and pay HomeAdvisor for the services directly. HomeAdvisor then fulfills the request with independently established home services providers engaged in a trade, occupation and/or business that customarily provides such services. Revenue from HomeAdvisor’s pre-priced product offering is also recorded on a gross basis effective January 1, 2020. The change to gross revenue reporting for Handy and HomeAdvisor’s pre-priced product offering, effective January 1, 2020, resulted in an increase in revenue of $73.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Vimeo revenue is derived primarily from annual and monthly SaaS subscription fees paid by subscribers for self-serve and enterprise subscription plans.
Dotdash revenue consists principally of Display Advertising Revenue and Performance Marketing Revenue.
The Search segment consists of Ask Media Group and the Desktop business. Ask Media Group and Desktop revenue consist principally of advertising revenue, which is generated primarily through the display of paid listings in response to search queries. The majority of the paid listings displayed are supplied to us by Google pursuant to the services agreement with Google, described below under "Services Agreement with Google." Ask Media Group also earns revenue from display advertisements (sold directly and through programmatic ad sales). Desktop revenue also includes fees paid by subscribers for downloadable desktop applications, as well as display advertisements.
Included in the Emerging & Other segment are Care.com and Mosaic Group. Care.com generates revenue through subscription fees from families and caregivers to its suite of products and services, as well as through annual contracts with corporate employers who provide access to Care.com’s suite of products and services as an employee benefit and through contracts with businesses that recruit employees through its platform. Mosaic Group revenue consists primarily of fees paid by subscribers for downloadable mobile applications distributed through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store and directly to consumers, as well as display advertisements. Revenue for the remaining businesses within the Emerging & Other segment is generated primarily through marketplace services, advertising, media production and distribution, and subscriptions.
Services Agreement with Google (the "Services Agreement")
A meaningful portion of the Company's revenue (and a substantial portion of IAC’s net cash from operations that it can freely access) is attributable to the Services Agreement. In addition, the Company earns certain other advertising revenue from Google that is not attributable to the Services Agreement. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, total revenue earned from Google was $556.4 million, $733.5 million and $825.2 million, respectively, representing 18%, 27% and
33%, respectively, of the Company's total revenue. The related accounts receivable totaled $61.9 million and $53.0 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The total revenue earned from the Services Agreement for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, was $498.3 million, $677.0 million and $765.6 million, respectively, representing 16%, 25% and 30%, respectively, of the Company's total revenue.
The revenue attributable to the Services Agreement is earned by the Desktop business and Ask Media Group, both within the Search segment. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, revenue earned from the Services Agreement was $153.5 million, $291.1 million and $426.5 million, respectively, within the Desktop business and $344.8 million, $385.9 million and $339.0 million, respectively, within Ask Media Group.
The Services Agreement expires on March 31, 2023; provided that during each September, either party may, after discussion with the other party, terminate the Services Agreement, effective on September 30 of the year following the year such notice is given. Neither party gave notice to the other party to terminate the Services Agreement pursuant to this provision in September 2020. The Services Agreement requires that the Company comply with certain guidelines promulgated by Google. Google may generally unilaterally update its policies and guidelines without advance notice. These updates may be specific to the Services Agreement or could be more general and thereby impact the Company as well as other companies. These policy and guideline updates have in the past and could in the future require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of our products, services and/or business practices, which have been and could be costly to address and have had or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As described below, Google has made changes to the policies under the Services Agreement and has also made industry-wide changes that have negatively impacted the Desktop business and it may do so in the future.
Certain industry-wide policy changes became effective on July 1, 2019 and August 27, 2020. These industry-wide changes, combined with other changes to policies under the Services Agreement during the second half of 2019, have had a negative impact on the historical and expected future results of operations of the Desktop business. In addition, at multiple times during the fourth quarter of 2020, Google suspended services with respect to some of IAC's products and may do so in the future. The Desktop business elected to modify certain marketing strategies in early January 2021. This is expected to further reduce the revenue and profitability of the Desktop business in 2021.
The reduction in revenue and profitability was the primary factor in the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments related to the Desktop business recorded in the year ended December 31, 2020 of $265.1 million and $32.2 million, respectively. The impact of COVD-19 was an additional factor.
Distribution, Marketing and Advertiser Relationships
We pay traffic acquisition costs, which consist of payments made to partners who direct traffic to our Ask Media Group websites, who distribute our business-to-business customized browser-based applications and who integrate our paid listings into their websites, and fees paid to Apple and Google related to the distribution and the facilitation of in-app purchases of product features. We also pay to market and distribute our services on third-party distribution channels, such as Google and other search engines and social media websites such as Facebook. In addition, some of our businesses manage affiliate programs, pursuant to which we pay commissions and fees to third parties based on revenue earned. These distribution channels might also offer their own services and products, as well as those of other third parties, which compete with those we offer.
We market and offer our services and products to consumers through branded websites, allowing consumers to transact directly with us in a convenient manner. We have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in online and offline advertising to build our brands and drive traffic to our websites and consumers and advertisers to our businesses.
COVID-19 Update and Impairments
The impact on the Company from the COVID-19 outbreak, which has been declared a "pandemic" by the World Health Organization, has been varied. The extent to which developments related to the COVID-19 outbreak and measures designed to curb its spread continue to impact the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, all of which are highly uncertain and many of which are beyond the Company’s control, including the speed of contagion, the development and implementation of effective preventative measures and possible treatments, the scope of governmental and other restrictions on travel, discretionary services and other activity, and public reactions to these developments. For example, these developments and measures have resulted in rapid and adverse changes to the operating
environment in which we do business, as well as significant uncertainty concerning the near and long term economic ramifications of the COVID-19 outbreak, which have adversely impacted our ability to forecast our results and respond in a timely and effective manner to trends related to the COVID-19 outbreak. The longer the global outbreak and measures designed to curb the spread of the virus continue to adversely affect levels of consumer confidence, discretionary spending and the willingness of consumers to interact with other consumers, vendors and service providers face-to-face (and in turn, adversely affect demand for the Company’s various products and services), the greater the adverse impact is likely to be on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations and the more limited will be the Company’s ability to try and make up for delayed or lost revenues.
When COVID-19 first impacted the Company's ANGI Homeservices business in the spring of 2020, ANGI Homeservices experienced a decline in demand for service requests, driven primarily by decreases in demand in certain categories of jobs (particularly discretionary indoor projects). Toward the end of the spring of 2020, ANGI Homeservices experienced a rebound in service requests, exceeding pre-COVID-19 growth levels, driven by increased demand from homeowners who spent more time at home due to measures taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19. ANGI Homeservices continued to experience strong demand for home services in the second half of 2020. However, many service professionals' businesses have been adversely impacted by labor and material constraints and many service professionals have limited capacity to take on new business, which has negatively impacted ANGI Homeservices' ability to monetize this increased level of service requests. Vimeo has seen strong revenue growth as the demand for communication via video has increased due to the pandemic. The Search segment has experienced a decline in revenue due, in part, to the decrease in advertising rates due to the impact of COVID-19, which decrease in rates was more significant earlier in the year.
In the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the Company determined that the effects of COVID-19 were an indicator of possible impairment for certain of its assets and identified the following impairments:
•a $212.0 million impairment related to the goodwill of the Desktop reporting unit;
•a $21.4 million impairment related to certain indefinite-lived intangible assets of the Desktop reporting unit;
•a $51.5 million impairment of certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values; and
•a $7.5 million impairment of a note receivable and a warrant related to certain investees.
In the quarter ended September 30, 2020, the Company reassessed the fair values of the Desktop reporting unit and the related indefinite-lived intangible assets and recorded impairments equal to the remaining carrying value of the goodwill of $53.2 million and $10.8 million related to the intangible assets. The reduction in the Company’s fair value estimates of the Desktop business in the first and third quarters of 2020 was primarily due to lower consumer queries, increasing challenges in monetization and the reduced ability to market profitably due to browser policy changes implemented by Google and other browsers. The effects of COVID-19 on monetization were an additional factor. Refer to "Services Agreement with Google" for additional information.
There were no additional impairments identified during the year ended December 31, 2020.
In addition, the United States, which represents 80% of the Company's revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, experienced a significant resurgence of the coronavirus and with record levels of COVID-19 infections being reported during the fourth quarter of 2020 and continuing into the first quarter of 2021. Europe, which is the second largest market for the Company's products and services, has also seen a dramatic resurgence in COVID-19. This resurgence and the measures designed to curb its spread could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 8 - Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. For a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, please refer to "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the annual audited combined financial statements of the Company and notes thereto filed on the Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities Exchange Commission on October 5, 2020.
Revenue
•ANGI revenue increased 11% to $1.5 billion driven by Marketplace Revenue growth of $138.7 million, or 14%, and an increase of $6.9 million, or 3%, in Advertising & Other Revenue, partially offset by a decline of $3.8 million, or 5%, at the European businesses. The increase in Marketplace Revenue was due primarily to an increase of 18% in Marketplace Service Requests to 32.4 million resulting in a 4% increase in Marketplace Monetized Transactions to 16.7 million, and an increase in revenue of $73.8 million due to the change to gross revenue reporting for Handy and HomeAdvisor’s pre-priced product offering, effective January 1, 2020. Advertising & Other Revenue increased due primarily to an increase in Angie's List revenue driven by an increase in Advertising SPs. The revenue decline at the European businesses was due primarily to the impact of COVID-19 and lower monetization from transitioning the business in France to a common European technology platform with the businesses in the Netherlands and Italy, which began in early February 2020, partially offset by the favorable impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the EURO and British Pound.
•Vimeo revenue grew 44% to $283.2 million driven by a 26% increase in Average Subscribers to 1.4 million, a 14% increase in ARPU, and the contribution of Magisto. The growth in Subscribers is due to the increase in self-serve and enterprise customers as individuals, businesses and organizations accelerated their adoption of video to communicate due, in part, to the effects of COVID-19. ARPU increased as a greater percentage of both new and existing self-serve subscribers purchased, on average, higher-priced offerings that include features, such as additional storage and bandwidth, video creation and editing tools and live streaming capability. The growth in enterprise customers, whose average annual contract values are much greater, also contributed to ARPU growth. For the year ending December 31, 2020, the number of enterprise subscribers increased from nearly 2,100 to more than 3,800, and enterprise revenue, as a percentage of total revenue, increased from 17% to 23%. Revenue in 2019 included $2.3 million from the hardware business, which was sold in the first quarter of 2019.
•Dotdash revenue increased 28% to $213.8 million due to growth of 85% in Performance Marketing Revenue and 9% higher Display Advertising Revenue. The growth in Performance Marketing Revenue was due primarily to growth in both affiliate commerce commission revenue and performance marketing commission revenue due to increased online sales as a result of COVID-19. The higher Display Advertising Revenue was due to an increase in advertising sold through our sales team, partially offset by the impact of COVID-19.
•Search revenue decreased 17% to $613.3 million, due to a decrease of $139.6 million, or 44%, from Desktop, partially offset by an increase of $10.7 million, or 3% from Ask Media Group. The decrease in Desktop revenue was driven by lower consumer queries, increasing challenges in monetization and the reduced ability to market profitably due to browser policy changes implemented by Google and other browsers, certain industry-wide policy changes implemented by Google, which became effective on July 1, 2019 and August 27, 2020, the impact of Google's
suspension of some of Desktop's products in the fourth quarter of 2020 and a decrease in advertising rates due to the impact of COVID-19. The increase in Ask Media Group revenue was due to growth in paid traffic.
•Emerging & Other revenue increased 71% to $469.8 million due primarily to the contributions of Care.com, acquired February 11, 2020, and Nursefly, acquired June 26, 2019, and an increase in revenue at Mosaic, partially offset by the sale of College Humor Media during the first quarter of 2020, and lower revenue at IAC Films.
Cost of revenue
Cost of revenue in 2020 increased from 2019 due to increases of $126.8 million from ANGI, $67.7 million from Emerging & Other and $20.1 million from Vimeo.
•The ANGI increase was due primarily to the change from net to gross revenue reporting for Handy and HomeAdvisor's pre-priced product offering, effective January 1, 2020, as well as growth of the pre-priced product offering itself.
•The Emerging & Other increase was due primarily to $74.2 million of expense from the inclusion of Care.com, partially offset by a decrease of $14.1 million at College Humor Media due to its sale during the first quarter of 2020.
•The Vimeo increase was due primarily to an increase of $9.7 million in credit card processing fees, $2.3 million in in-app purchase fees paid to Google and Apple and an increase in outsourced personnel costs and compensation expense related to increased customer care personnel, partially offset by a decrease of $2.6 million in hosting fees and $1.4 million of product costs due to the sale of the hardware business during the first quarter of 2019. The increase in credit card processing fees and in-app purchase fees is due primarily to increases in subscriptions and video on-demand transactions. The decrease in hosting fees is due primarily to cost reduction initiatives and lower rates for storage and transcoding.
Selling and marketing expense
Selling and marketing expense in 2020 increased from 2019 due to increases of $62.6 million from Emerging & Other, $29.4 million from ANGI, $21.2 million from Vimeo and $7.0 million from Dotdash, partially offset by a decrease of $51.6 million from Search.
•The Emerging & Other increase was due primarily to $59.8 million of expense from the inclusion of Care.com and increases of $6.4 million and $2.4 million in advertising expense at Mosaic and Nursefly, respectively, partially offset by decreases of $4.7 million in compensation and $3.4 million in advertising expense at College Humor Media due to its sale during the first quarter of 2020.
•The ANGI increase was due primarily to increases in compensation expense of $21.6 million, outsourced personnel and consulting costs of $7.1 million and advertising expense of $3.3 million, partially offset by a decrease of $3.9 million in travel related expenses resulting from the impact of COVID-19. The increase in compensation expense was due primarily to increased commission expense and severance costs recorded in the third quarter of 2020 associated with headcount reductions in France. The increase in outsourced personnel and consulting costs was due primarily to various sales initiatives at Handy. Advertising expense increased due primarily to an increase in online marketing costs as the proportion of service requests from Google paid traffic increased. ANGI continues to benefit from the
search engine marketing strategy that was implemented in the second half of 2019, which focuses on the lifetime profitability rather than the cost of each service request. This increase in online marketing was partially offset by a decrease in television spend resulting from cost cutting initiatives due to the impact of COVID-19.
•The Vimeo increase was due primarily to increases in compensation expense of $12.5 million due, in part, to growth in the sales force for enterprise offerings and increased commission expense due to the increase in enterprise bookings, marketing of $5.3 million and software license and maintenance costs of $1.9 million.
•The Dotdash increase was due primarily to increases in compensation expense of $7.4 million, due, in part, to growth in the sales force, and advertising expense of $1.2 million, partially offset by a decrease of $1.3 million in travel related expenses resulting from the impact of COVID-19.
•The Search decrease was due primarily to a decrease in marketing of $52.0 million at Desktop as we mitigate the negative impact on revenue from the browser policy changes and COVID-19.
General and administrative expense
General and administrative expense in 2020 increased from 2019 due to increases of $107.5 million from Corporate, $46.3 million from Emerging & Other and $25.8 million from ANGI.
•The Corporate increase was due primarily to an increase of $63.4 million in compensation expense driven by an increase of $45.9 million in stock-based compensation expense and an increase in employer taxes related to Match Group stock option exercises by IAC employees during the third and fourth quarters of 2020, $25.0 million related to the IAC Fellows Foundation endowment and higher professional fees, including increases of $11.8 million and $2.2 million in costs related to the MTCH Separation and the Spin-off, respectively. The increase in stock-based compensation is due primarily to a $55.1 million modification charge related to the MTCH Separation and the issuance of new equity awards since 2019, partially offset by the vesting of awards.
•The Emerging & Other increase was due primarily to $41.3 million of expense from the inclusion of Care.com and a decrease in income of $12.8 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments (income of $6.9 million in 2020 compared to income of $19.7 million in 2019), partially offset by a decrease of $5.7 million at College Humor Media due to its sale during the first quarter of 2020. The income from acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments was due to the decrease in the expected amount of contingent consideration to be paid out in connection with a previous acquisition.
•The ANGI increase was due primarily to increases of $15.1 million in compensation expense, $14.0 million in the provision for credit losses, $3.3 million in outsourced personnel costs and $2.5 million in professional fees, partially offset by decreases of $3.6 million in travel related expenses resulting from the impact of COVID-19, $2.3 million in software license and maintenance costs and $1.2 million in non-payroll taxes. The increase in compensation expense is due primarily to an increase in stock-based compensation expense and severance costs recorded in the European business associated with headcount reductions in France. The increase in stock-based compensation expense is due primarily to the issuance of new equity awards since 2019, modification charges in 2020 and the reversal in the second half of 2019 of $7.3 million of expense related to certain performance-based awards that did not vest. The increase in the provision for credit losses is due to higher Marketplace Revenue, the impact from COVID-19 on expected credit losses and anticipated losses from Advertising SPs. The increase in outsourced personnel costs is due primarily to efforts to respond to an increase in call volume related to ANGI's customer service function. The increase in professional fees is due primarily to an increase in legal fees. The decrease in non-payroll taxes is due, in part, to a decrease in property taxes in North America and the digital services tax in Europe.
Product development expense
Product development expense in 2020 increased from 2019 due to increases of $41.3 million from Emerging & Other, $18.2 million from Vimeo and $10.5 million from Dotdash.
•The Emerging & Other increase was due primarily to $36.2 million of expense from the inclusion of Care.com and an increase of $4.1 million in compensation expense at Mosaic due primarily to increased headcount, partially offset by a decrease of $2.7 million at College Humor Media due to its sale during the first quarter of 2020.
•The Vimeo increase was due primarily to increases of $13.0 million in compensation expense due primarily to increased headcount due, in part, to the inclusion of Magisto, acquired May 28, 2019, $1.8 million in consulting costs and $1.8 million in software license and maintenance costs.
•The Dotdash increase was due primarily to an increase of $11.2 million in compensation expense due primarily to increased headcount and an increase in expense for third-party contractors.
Depreciation
Depreciation in 2020 increased from 2019 due primarily to the investments in capitalized software to support ANGI's products and services, partially offset by a decrease in leasehold improvements related to office space at ANGI.
Operating (loss) income
________________________
NM = Not meaningful.
Operating loss increased $521.9 million to a loss of $572.3 million due primarily to a goodwill impairment of $265.1 million and $32.2 million in indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments at Search related to the Desktop business, a decrease in Adjusted EBITDA of $113.3 million, described below, and increases of $62.9 million in stock-based compensation expense, $25.5 million in amortization of intangibles, excluding the Desktop impairment noted above, $13.3 million in
depreciation and a change of $12.8 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments (income of $6.9 million in 2020 compared to income of $19.7 million in 2019). The overall increase in amortization of intangibles of $57.7 million was due principally to the inclusion in 2020 of indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments related to the Desktop business noted above, an increase in amortization related to recent acquisitions (primarily Care.com and Magisto) and a reduction in the estimated useful lives of certain intangible assets. The goodwill and the indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments are described above in "COVID-19 Update and Impairments". The increase in stock-based compensation expense was due primarily to a modification charge of $56.0 million related to the MTCH Separation, the issuance of new equity awards in 2020 and other modification charges in 2020, partially offset by the vesting of awards. The increase in depreciation was due primarily to investments in capitalized software to support ANGI's products and services and leasehold improvements related to additional office space at ANGI.
See "Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the financial statements included in "Item 8 - Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements" for a detailed description of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments.
The aggregate carrying value of goodwill for which the most recent estimate of the excess of fair value over carrying value is less than 20% is approximately $759.5 million. There are no indefinite-lived intangible assets for which the most recent estimate of the excess fair value over carrying value is less than 20%.
At December 31, 2020, there was $398.3 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all equity-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 6.2 years.
Adjusted EBITDA
For a reconciliation of net earnings attributable to IAC shareholders to operating loss to Adjusted EBITDA, see "Principles of Financial Reporting." For a reconciliation of operating (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA for the Company's reportable segments, see "Note 12-Segment Information" to the financial statements included in "Item 8 - Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
•ANGI Adjusted EBITDA decreased 15% to $172.8 million, despite higher revenue due primarily to an increase in cost of revenue, an increase in compensation expense due to increased commission expense and severance costs recorded in the third quarter of 2020 associated with headcount reductions in France and an increase of $14.0 million in the provision for credit losses due to higher Marketplace Revenue, the impact from COVID-19 on expected credit losses and anticipated losses on Angie’s List service professionals under contract for advertising.
•Vimeo Adjusted EBITDA loss decreased 73% to $11.2 million, due primarily to higher revenue, partially offset by higher compensation expense due primarily to an increase in headcount and increases of $11.9 million in credit card processing fees and in in-app purchase fees, higher marketing costs and costs related to the Spin-off.
•Dotdash Adjusted EBITDA increased 67% to $66.2 million due primarily to higher revenue, partially offset by higher compensation expense, an increase in expense for third-party contractors and an increase in the provision for credit losses due, in part, to the impact of COVID-19 on expected credit losses.
•Search Adjusted EBITDA decreased 59% to $51.3 million due to a decrease in revenue, partially offset by a decrease in marketing of $52.0 million at Desktop as we mitigate the negative impact on revenue from the browser policy changes and COVID-19.
•Emerging & Other Adjusted EBITDA loss increased $9.3 million to $37.7 million due primarily to $34.0 million in transaction-related items from the Care.com acquisition (including $17.3 million in deferred revenue write-offs and $16.7 million in transaction-related costs), and increased losses at IAC Films, Bluecrew and Nursefly, partially offset by lower losses at College Humor Media, due to its sale during the first quarter of 2020.
•Corporate Adjusted EBITDA loss increased 66% to $147.5 million due primarily to the $25.0 million contribution to the IAC Fellows Foundation, higher professional fees, including increases of $11.8 million and $2.2 million in costs related to the MTCH Separation and the Spin-off, respectively, and an increase in compensation expense driven primarily by increased employer taxes related to Match Group stock option exercises by IAC employees during the third and fourth quarters of 2020.
Interest expense
Interest expense in 2020 increased from 2019 due primarily to the issuance of the ANGI Group Senior Notes in August 2020 and the write-off of deferred financing costs as a result of the termination of the IAC Group $250 million revolving credit facility effective October 2, 2020, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on the ANGI Group Term Loan due to lower interest rates and the decrease in the average outstanding balance of the ANGI Group Term Loan compared to the prior year.
Unrealized gain on investment in MGM Resorts International
The Company recognized an unrealized gain of $840.5 million on its investment in MGM Resorts International ("MGM") during 2020.
Other (expense) income, net
Other expense, net in 2020 includes: $51.5 million in impairments related to investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values and $7.5 million in impairments of a note receivable and a warrant related to certain investees due to the impact of COVID-19; and $7.2 million of interest income.
Other income, net in 2019 includes: a $20.5 million gain related to the sale of our investment in Pinterest; $18.5 million in net upward adjustments related to investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values; $15.2 million of interest income; a unrealized reduction of $9.1 million in the estimated fair value of a warrant; a realized loss of $8.2 million related to the sale of Vimeo's hardware business in the first quarter of 2019; and a $1.8 million mark-to-market charge for an indemnification claim related to the Handy acquisition that was settled in ANGI shares during the first quarter of 2020.
Income tax benefit
For further details of income tax matters, see "Note 3-Income Taxes" to the financial statements included in "Item 8 - Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
In 2020, the income tax benefit was due primarily to excess tax benefits generated by the exercise and vesting of stock-based awards, partially offset by the non-deductible portion of the Desktop impairment.
In 2019, the income tax benefit was due primarily to excess tax benefits generated by the exercise and vesting of stock-based awards, realization of certain deferred tax assets, and research credits.
Net (loss) earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests
Net (loss) earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2020 and 2019 primarily represents the publicly-held interest in ANGI's earnings. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2019 includes a third party interest in a subsidiary that held the gain on our investment in Pinterest.
PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL REPORTING
The Company reports Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). This measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. We believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. The Company endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measure presented by providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure. We encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measure, which we discuss below.
Definition of Non-GAAP Measure
Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable, and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements. We believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors. The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations because it excludes the impact of these expenses.
The following table reconciles net earnings attributable to IAC shareholders to operating loss to Adjusted EBITDA:
For a reconciliation of operating (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA for the Company's reportable segments, see "Note 12-Segment Information" to the financial statements included in "Item 8 - Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Non-Cash Expenses That Are Excluded From Our Non-GAAP Measure
Stock-based compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with awards issued by certain subsidiaries of the Company and expense related to awards that were granted under various IAC stock and annual incentive plans. These expenses are not paid in cash and we view the economic costs of stock-based awards to be the dilution to our share base; we also include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding for GAAP earnings per share using the treasury stock method. The Company is currently settling all stock-based awards other than IAC denominated stock options on a net basis; IAC remits the required tax-withholding amounts for net-settled awards from its current funds.
Depreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our building, capitalized software, leasehold improvements and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives, or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term, if shorter.
Amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses related primarily to acquisitions. At the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as technology, service professional relationships, customer lists and user base, memberships, trade names and content, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives. Value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization. An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. We believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairments of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.
Gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements are accounting adjustments to report contingent consideration liabilities at fair value. These adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered non-operational in nature and, therefore, are not indicative of current or future performance or the ongoing cost of doing business.
FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Financial Position
The Company's international cash can be repatriated without significant tax consequences. For the year ending December 31, 2020, there was no international cash repatriated to the U.S.
For a detailed description of long-term debt, see "Note 7-Long-term Debt" to the financial statements included in "Item 8 - Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Cash Flow Information
In summary, IAC's cash flows are as follows:
Net cash provided by operating activities consists of earnings adjusted for non-cash items, the effect of changes in working capital and acquisition-related contingent consideration payments (to the extent greater than the liability initially recognized at the time of acquisition). Non-cash adjustments include the unrealized gain on the investment in MGM, goodwill impairments, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles, provision for credit losses, depreciation, deferred income taxes, net losses (gains) on equity securities, and net (gains) losses from the sale of businesses.
Adjustments to earnings consist primarily of $840.6 million of the unrealized gain on the investment in MGM and $31.9
million of deferred income taxes, partially offset by a $265.1 million goodwill impairment, $197.2 million of stock-based compensation expense, $141.6 million of amortization of intangibles, including impairments of $32.2 million, $80.8 million of provision for credit losses, $69.3 million of depreciation and $40.8 million of losses on equity securities, net, which includes $51.5 million of impairments of certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values. The decrease from changes in working capital primarily consists of an increase in accounts receivable of $139.1 million and decrease in income taxes payable and receivable of $12.2 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $81.4 million. The increase in accounts receivable is due primarily to revenue growth at ANGI, Care.com, and Dotdash. The decrease in income taxes payable and receivable is due primarily to the settlement of audits and 2020 income tax payments in excess of 2020 income tax accruals. The increase in deferred revenue is due primarily to growth in subscription sales at Vimeo and Care.com.
Net cash used in investing activities includes $1.0 billion for the purchase of 59.0 million shares of MGM, cash used in investments and acquisitions of $685.8 million, which is primarily related to the Care.com acquisition, purchases (net of maturities) of marketable debt securities of $174.8 million, and capital expenditures of $61.6 million, which is primarily related to investments in capitalized software at ANGI to support their products and services, and leasehold improvements, partially offset by a decrease in notes receivable-related party of $54.8 million and proceeds from the sale of businesses and investments of $26.3 million, which are primarily related to the sales of Dictionary and Electus in 2018, a portion of the proceeds of which were held in escrow and received in 2020, and the sales of certain investments.
Net cash provided by financing activities includes transfers of $1.7 billion from Old IAC to the Company pursuant to the terms of the MTCH Separation, $1.4 billion of proceeds related to the sale of Old IAC Class M common stock, cash merger consideration of $837.9 million paid by Old IAC in connection with the MTCH Separation, $500.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of the ANGI Group Senior Notes, and $149.6 million of net proceeds from the issuance of 8.7 million shares of Vimeo Class A common stock, partially offset by $85.1 million for withholding taxes paid on behalf of IAC employees for stock-based awards that were net settled, $64.1 million for withholding taxes paid on behalf of ANGI employees for stock-based awards that were net settled, $63.7 million for the repurchase of 8.5 million shares of ANGI Class A common stock, on a settlement date basis, at an average price of $7.47 per share, $27.5 million in principal payments on the ANGI Term Loan, including prepayment of the $13.8 million of principal payments that were otherwise due in 2021, $6.5 million for debt issuance costs, and $4.6 million for the purchase of redeemable noncontrolling interests.
Adjustments to earnings consist primarily of $134.3 million of stock-based compensation expense, $83.9 million of amortization of intangibles, $65.7 million of provision for credit losses, and $55.9 million of depreciation, partially offset by $62.8 million of deferred income taxes and $41.4 million of net gains on equity securities. The deferred income tax benefit primarily relates to the net operating loss created by the exercise and vesting of stock-based awards and the realization of gains on certain equity securities. The decrease from changes in working capital primarily consists of an increase in accounts receivable of $73.6 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $28.1 million and a decrease in other assets of $10.6 million. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to revenue growth at ANGI and Dotdash. The increase in deferred revenue is due primarily to growth in subscription sales at Vimeo and Mosaic Group. The decrease in other assets is due, in part, to a decrease in capitalized downloadable search toolbar costs at Search.
Net cash used in investing activities includes cash used for investments and acquisitions of $450.2 million, principally related to the investment in Turo and acquisitions of Magisto and Fixd Repair, capital expenditures of $97.9 million, primarily related to investments in the development of capitalized software at ANGI to support its products and services as well as leasehold improvements related to additional office space at ANGI, and the payment of a deposit of $23.0 million for an ownership interest in an aircraft at Corporate, and an increase in related party notes receivable of $54.8 million, partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of investments and businesses of $164.8 million, principally related to the sale of our investment in Pinterest and the proceeds received in 2019 related to the December 31, 2018 sale of Felix, and proceeds from maturities (net of purchases) of marketable debt securities of $25.0 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities includes cash transfers of $263.3 million from Old IAC pursuant to Old IAC's centrally managed U.S. treasury function, partially offset by $56.9 million for the repurchase of 7.2 million shares of ANGI common stock, on a settlement date basis, at an average price of $7.90 per share, $35.3 million for withholding taxes paid on behalf of ANGI employees for stock-based awards that were net settled, $27.5 million for distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests, and $13.8 million in principal payments on ANGI debt.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Financing Arrangements
In connection with the MTCH Separation the Company received $1.4 billion of proceeds related to the sale of Old IAC Class M common stock and cash merger consideration of $837.9 million paid by Old IAC.
On November 10, 2020, Vimeo raised $150 million of equity capital via the sale of 8.7 million shares of Class A voting common stock at a price of $17.33 per share, based on a pre-money valuation of $2.75 billion. During November 2020, Vimeo paid a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of Class A voting common stock and Class B non-voting common stock to holders of record on November 5, 2020, for approximately $31 million in aggregate. Of this amount, $30.7 million was paid to IAC. In January 2021, Vimeo raised $300 million of equity capital via the sale of 6.2 million shares of Vimeo Class A voting common stock for $200 million, or $32.41 per share, at a $5.2 billion pre-money valuation, and 2.8 million shares of Vimeo Class A voting common stock for $100 million, or $35.35 per share, at a $5.7 billion pre-money valuation. At December 31, 2020, Vimeo had $94.6 million of debt payable to IAC and $4.2 million of accrued interest, all of which were repaid by Vimeo in January 2021 from the proceeds of the January 2021 primary equity issuance described above.
On August 20, 2020, ANGI Group issued $500 million of its ANGI Group Senior Notes due August 15, 2028. The proceeds from the offering are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include potential future acquisitions and return of capital.
The $250 million ANGI Group Revolving Facility expires on November 5, 2023. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings under the ANGI Group Revolving Facility. The annual commitment fee on undrawn funds is currently 35 basis points and is based on ANGI Group's consolidated net leverage ratio most recently reported. Borrowings under the ANGI Group Revolving Facility bear interest, at ANGI Group's option, at either a base rate or LIBOR, in each case plus an applicable margin, which is determined based on ANGI Group's consolidated net leverage ratio.
The ANGI Group Credit Agreement contains covenants that would limit ANGI Group's ability to pay dividends or make distributions in the event a default has occurred or if ANGI Group's consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the ANGI Group Credit Agreement) exceeds 4.25 to 1.0. There were no such limitations at December 31, 2020.
On February 12, 2021, Vimeo, Inc. entered into a five-year $100 million revolving credit facility (the "Vimeo Credit Facility"), which is secured by substantially all of its assets, subject to certain exceptions. Borrowings under the Vimeo Credit Facility bear interest, at Vimeo's option, at either a base rate or LIBOR, in each case plus an applicable margin, which is determined by reference to a pricing grid based on Vimeo’s consolidated net leverage ratio. At closing, there were no borrowings under the Vimeo Credit Facility.
Share Repurchase Authorizations and Activity
On June 30, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized repurchases up to 8.0 million shares of common stock, which is equal to the number of shares that were available under the repurchase authorization at Old IAC immediately prior to the MTCH Separation.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, ANGI repurchased 8.4 million shares of its Class A common stock, on a trade date basis, at an average price of $7.45 per share, or $62.6 million in aggregate. From January 1, 2021 through February 2, 2021, ANGI repurchased an additional 0.4 million shares at an average price of $11.85 per share, or $4.9 million in aggregate. ANGI had 18.9 million shares remaining in its share repurchase authorization as of February 2, 2021.
IAC and ANGI may purchase their shares over an indefinite period of time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, depending on those factors management deems relevant at any particular time, including, without limitation, market conditions, share price and future outlook.
Outstanding Stock-based Awards
IAC and ANGI may settle stock options and RSUs on a gross or a net basis upon factors deemed relevant at the time. To the extent that equity awards are settled on a net basis, the holders of the awards receive shares of IAC or ANGI, as applicable, with a value equal to the fair value of the award on the vest date for RSUs and restricted stock and upon exercise for stock options or stock settled appreciation rights, less in each case an amount equal to the required cash tax withholding payment, which will be paid by IAC or ANGI, as applicable, on the employee's behalf. All awards other than IAC denominated stock options are being settled currently on a net basis.
Certain previously issued ANGI stock appreciation rights are settleable in either shares of ANGI common stock or shares of IAC common stock at IAC's option. If settled in IAC common stock, ANGI reimburses IAC in shares of its common stock.
The following table summarizes (i) the aggregate intrinsic value of ANGI options, ANGI stock settled stock-appreciation rights, IAC and ANGI non-publicly traded subsidiary denominated stock settled stock appreciation rights and (ii) the aggregate fair value (based on stock prices as of January 29, 2021) of IAC and ANGI RSUs and IAC restricted stock outstanding as of that date; assuming these awards were net settled on that date, the withholding taxes that would be paid by the Company on behalf of employees upon exercise or vesting that would be payable (assuming these equity awards are net settled with a 50% tax rate), and the shares that would have been issued are as follows:
_______________
(a) The number of shares ultimately needed to settle these awards and the cash withholding tax obligation may vary significantly as a result of the determination of the fair value of the relevant subsidiary. In addition, the number of shares required to settle these awards will be impacted by movement in the stock price of IAC.
(b) Excludes the aggregate intrinsic value of Vimeo stock settled stock appreciation rights. The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding awards as of January 29, 2021, assuming a per share price of $35.35, which is equal to the per share price of Vimeo based upon a $5.7 billion pre-money valuation, is $405.1 million. Of this amount, $122.8 million is attributable to currently vested awards. After the Spin-off, these awards will be settled in shares of SpinCo common stock. SpinCo management will have the discretion to continue to net settle these awards or require the award holder to pay its share of the withholding tax, which he or she may do so by selling SpinCo common shares. If Vimeo chooses to settle these awards on a net basis the withholding taxes payable by Vimeo on behalf of its employees upon net settlement would be $202.6 million, assuming a 50% withholding rate.
(c) The Company has the discretion to settle these awards net of withholding tax and exercise price or require the award holder to pay its share of the withholding tax, which he or she may do so by selling IAC common shares. Assuming all IAC stock options outstanding on January 29, 2021 were settled through the issuance of a number of IAC common shares equal to the number of stock options exercised, the Company would have issued 3.9 million common shares and would have received $82.3 million in cash proceeds.
Upon completion of the Spin-off, each option to purchase shares of IAC common stock will convert into an option to purchase shares of IAC common stock and an option to purchase shares of SpinCo common stock with adjustments to the number of shares subject to each option and the option exercise prices based on (i) the value of IAC common stock prior to the Spin-off and (ii) the value of IAC common stock and the value of SpinCo common stock after giving effect to the Spin-off. Based upon (i) the number of IAC options outstanding on January 29, 2021; (ii) the closing stock price of IAC on January 29, 2021 of $209.95 per share (iii) and the per share price of Vimeo common stock of $35.35 per share (from the equity raise in January 2021 at the $5.7 billion pre-money valuation), approximately $100 million of this withholding obligation would relate to SpinCo options that will be issued in the transaction. This estimate is preliminary and will ultimately depend upon (i) the number of IAC options outstanding immediately prior to the Spin-off; (ii) the value of IAC common stock prior to the Spin-off; and (iii) the value of IAC common stock and the value of SpinCo common stock after giving effect to the Spin-off.
(d) Approximately 85% of the estimated withholding taxes payable on shares that will vest after December 31, 2021 is related to awards that are scheduled to cliff vest on the five-year anniversary of the grant date in 2025.
(e) On November 5, 2020, the Company granted 3.0 million shares of IAC restricted common stock to its CEO, that cliff vest on the ten-year anniversary of the grant date based on satisfaction of IAC's stock price targets and continued employment through the vesting date.
(f) Includes stock options, RSUs and subsidiary denominated equity.
(g) Pursuant to the employee matters agreement between IAC and ANGI, certain stock appreciation rights granted prior to the closing of the Combination and equity awards denominated in shares of ANGI's subsidiaries may be settled in either shares of ANGI common stock or IAC common stock. To the extent shares of IAC common stock are issued in settlement of these awards, ANGI is obligated to reimburse IAC for the cost of those shares by issuing shares of ANGI common stock.
For a detailed description of employee stock-based awards, see "Note 11-Stock-based Compensation" to the financial statements included in "Item 8 - Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Capital and Other Expenditures
The Company anticipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its operations. The Company's 2021 capital expenditures are expected to be higher than 2020 capital expenditures of $61.6 million by approximately 50% to 55%, due to the development of capitalized software to support products and services at ANGI and payments related to the purchase of a 50% interest in an aircraft at Corporate, the final payment for which is expected to be made in the third quarter of 2021.
Liquidity Assessment
As of December 31, 2020, the Company's consolidated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities was $3.7 billion, of which $862.7 million was held by ANGI. The $720.0 million of the Company's consolidated debt is a liability of ANGI. The Company generated $154.6 million of operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020, of which $188.4 million was generated by ANGI. ANGI is a separate and distinct legal entity with its own public shareholders and board of directors and has no obligation to provide the Company with funds. As a result, the Company cannot freely access the cash of ANGI and its subsidiaries.
The Company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, and expected positive cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, debt service, the payment of withholding taxes paid on behalf of employees for net-settled stock-based awards, and investing and other commitments for the foreseeable future.
The Company's liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services due to COVID-19 or other factors. As described in the "COVID-19 Update and Impairments" section above, to date, the COVID-19 outbreak and measures designed to curb its spread have had an impact on certain of the Company's businesses. The longer the global outbreak and measures designed to curb the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak have adverse impacts on economic conditions generally, the greater the adverse impact is likely to be on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company's capital structure could limit its ability to: (i) obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs, acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt service or other requirements; and (ii) use operating cash flow to make acquisitions or capital expenditures, or invest in other areas, such as developing business opportunities. The Company's ability to obtain additional financing could also be impacted by any disruptions in the financial markets caused by COVID-19 or otherwise. The Company may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to make additional acquisitions and investments. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to the Company or at all.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020
_______________________________________________________________________________
(a)The Company has excluded $20.4 million in unrecognized tax benefits and related interest from the table above as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities might be paid. For additional information on income taxes, see "Note 3-Income Taxes" to the financial statements included in "Item 8 - Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
(b)Long-term debt at December 31, 2020 consists of $500.0 million of ANGI Group Senior Notes, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.875% and $220.0 million of the ANGI Group Term Loan, which bears interest at a variable rate. The ANGI Group Term Loan bore interest at LIBOR plus 2.00%, or 2.16% at December 31, 2020. The amount of interest ultimately paid on the variable rate debt may differ based on changes in interest rates. For additional information on long-term debt, see "Note 7-Long-term Debt" to the financial statements included in "Item 8 - Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
(c)The Company leases land, office space, data center facilities and equipment used in connection with operations under various operating leases, the majority of which contain escalation clauses. Operating lease obligations include legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced. The Company is also committed to pay a portion of the related operating expenses under certain lease agreements. These operating expenses are not included in the table above. For additional information on operating leases, see "Note 13-Leases" to the financial statements included in "Item 8 - Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
(d)The purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for cloud computing arrangements, a remaining payment of $13.2 million related to a 50% interest in a corporate aircraft, and advertising commitments. For additional information on purchase obligations, see "Note 14-Commitments and Contingencies" to the financial statements included in "Item 8 - Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of IAC's accounting policies contained in "Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the financial statements included in "Item 8 - Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in regard to significant areas of judgment. Management of the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These estimates, judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our financial statements than others. What follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates.
Business Combinations and Contingent Consideration Arrangements
Acquisitions, which are generally referred to in GAAP as business combinations, are an important part of the Company's growth strategy. The Company invested $684.6 million and $196.6 million in acquisitions in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill.
Management makes two critical determinations at the time of an acquisition: (1) the reporting unit that will benefit from the acquisition and to which goodwill will be assigned and (2) the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired business to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based upon their fair values. The reporting unit determination is important beyond the initial allocation of purchase price because future impairment assessments of goodwill, as described below, are performed at the reporting unit level. Historically, when the Company’s acquisitions have been complementary to existing reporting units, for example, the 2019 acquisition of Magisto by Vimeo, the goodwill is allocated to the applicable reporting unit. Acquisitions within the Emerging & Other reportable segment, such as Care.com in 2020 and NurseFly in 2019, usually result in the creation of new reporting units because they are standalone businesses with unique product offerings, management or target markets, for example.
The allocation of purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based upon their fair values and is complex because of the judgments involved in determining these values. The determination of purchase price and the fair value of monetary assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically the least complex aspect of the Company’s accounting for business combinations due to management’s experience and/or the inherently lower level of judgment required. Due to the higher degree of complexity associated with the valuation of acquired intangible assets, the Company usually obtains the assistance of outside valuation experts in the allocation of purchase price to the identifiable intangible assets acquired, which can be both definite-lived, such as acquired technology, customer and contractor relationships, or indefinite lived, such as acquired trade names and trademarks. While outside valuation experts may be used, management has the ultimate responsibility for the valuation methods, models and inputs used and the resulting purchase price allocation. The excess purchase price over the value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill and is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the business combination as of the acquisition date.
In connection with certain business combinations, the Company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price. The premise underlying the accounting for contingent consideration arrangements is that there are divergent views as to the acquired company’s valuation between the Company and the selling shareholders of the acquiree. Therefore, a model is developed with future payments of a portion of the purchase price linked to one or more financial (e.g., revenue and/or profit performance) and/or operating (e.g., number of subscribers) metrics that will be achieved over a specified time frame in the future based upon the performance of the business. In keeping with the accounting guidance for business combinations, each of these arrangements is initially recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and the fair value is included in the aggregate purchase price. The Company determines the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements by using probability-weighted analyses to determine the amounts of the gross liability, and, if the arrangement is long-term in nature, applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation to determine the net amount reflected in the financial statements. The number of scenarios used is typically greater for longer-term arrangements. The contingent consideration arrangements are reassessed and reflected at current fair values for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled. The changes in the remeasured fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements during each reporting period, including the accretion of the discount, if applicable, are recognized in "General and administrative expense" in the statement of operations. Significant changes in the specified forecasted financial or operating metrics can result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement, which can result in volatility of general and administrative expense as the resulting remeasurement gains and losses are recorded.
Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
The carrying value of goodwill is $1.9 billion and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the Company's acquired trade names and trademarks, have a carrying value of $246.9 million and $225.3 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment as of October 1 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset has declined below its carrying value. In performing its annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company has the option under GAAP to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value; if the conclusion of the qualitative assessment is that there are no indicators of impairment, the Company does not perform a quantitative test, which would require a valuation of the reporting unit, as of October 1. GAAP provides a not all-inclusive set of examples of macroeconomic, industry, market and company specific factors for entities to consider in performing the qualitative assessment described above; management considers the factors it deems relevant in making its more likely than not assessments. While the Company also has the option under GAAP to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying values, the Company's policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as of October 1, in part, because the level of effort required to perform the quantitative and qualitative assessments is essentially equivalent.
If the conclusion of our qualitative assessment is that there are indicators of impairment and a quantitative test is required, the annual or interim quantitative test of the recovery of goodwill involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the Company's reporting unit that is being tested to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a goodwill impairment equal to the excess is recorded.
The Company’s annual assessment of the recovery of goodwill begins with management’s reassessment of its operating segments and reporting units. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, which is referred to as a component. This reassessment of reporting units is also made each time the Company changes its operating segments. If the goodwill of a reporting unit is allocated to newly formed reporting units, the allocation is usually made to each reporting unit based upon their relative fair values.
For the Company's annual goodwill test at October 1, 2020, a qualitative assessment of the ANGI, Vimeo, Care.com, Bluecrew and Nursefly reporting units' goodwill was performed because the Company concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was in excess of their respective carrying values. The primary factors that the Company considered in its qualitative assessment for each of these reporting units are described below:
•ANGI's October 1, 2020 market capitalization of $5.5 billion exceeded its carrying value by approximately $4.3 billion.
•The Company prepared valuations of the Vimeo, Bluecrew and Nursefly reporting units primarily in connection with the issuance and/or settlement of equity awards that are denominated in the equity of these businesses during the year ended December 31, 2020. The valuations were prepared time proximate to, however, not as of, October 1, 2020. The fair value of each of these businesses was in excess of its October 1, 2020 carrying value.
•The primary factors the Company considered in its qualitative assessment of the Care.com reporting unit were the strong forecasted operating performance of the Care.com reporting unit and the excess of estimated fair value based upon the purchase price at acquisition over the carrying value at October 1, 2020.
For the Company's annual goodwill test at October 1, 2020, the Company quantitatively tested the Mosaic Group reporting unit. The Company's quantitative test indicated that there was no impairment. The Company's Dotdash, Ask Media Group, Desktop, The Daily Beast and IAC Films reporting units have no goodwill as of October 1, 2020.
The aggregate carrying value of goodwill for which the most recent estimate of the excess of fair value over carrying value is less than 20% is approximately $759.5 million.
The fair value of the Company's reporting units (except for ANGI described above) is determined using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows ("DCF") and a market approach when it tests goodwill for impairment, either on an interim basis or annual basis as of October 1 each year. The Company uses the same approach in determining the fair value of its businesses in connection with its non-public subsidiary denominated stock-based compensation plans, which can be a significant factor in the decision to apply the qualitative assessment rather than a quantitative test. Determining fair value using a DCF analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on the
Company's most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates. The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units. Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed based on each reporting unit's current results and forecasted future performance, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. The discount rates used in the quantitative test for determining the fair value of the Company's reporting units was 15.0% in 2020 (for the Mosaic Group reporting unit) and 12.5% in 2019 (for the Desktop reporting unit). Determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies. From the comparable companies, a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units, we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use, monetization model, margin and growth characteristics, and brand strength operating in their respective sectors.
The Company determines the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using an avoided royalty DCF valuation analysis. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the Company's trade names and trademarks. The future cash flows are based on the Company's most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates. Assumptions used in the avoided royalty DCF analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. The discount rates used in the Company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 11.5% to 25.0% in 2020 and 11.5% to 27.5% in 2019, and the royalty rates used in both 2020 and 2019 ranged from 1.0% to 5.5%.
If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment equal to the excess is recorded. There are no indefinite-lived intangible assets for which the most recent estimate of the excess fair value over carrying value is less than 20%.
In the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the Company determined that the effects of COVID-19 were an indicator of possible impairment for certain of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and identified impairments of $212.0 million and $21.4 million related to the goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets of the Desktop reporting unit.
In the quarter ended September 30, 2020, the Company reassessed the fair values of the Desktop reporting unit and the related indefinite-lived intangible assets and recorded impairments equal to the remaining carrying value of the goodwill of $53.2 million and $10.8 million related to the intangible assets. The reduction in the Company’s fair value estimates of the Desktop business in the first and third quarters of 2020 was primarily due to lower consumer queries, increasing challenges in monetization and the reduced ability to market profitably due to policy changes implemented by Google and other browsers. The effects of COVID-19 on monetization were an additional factor.
The October 1, 2020 annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets did not identify any additional impairments.
The October 1, 2019 annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets identified a $3.3 million goodwill impairment charge and $0.7 million trade name impairment, both related to the College Humor Media business.
Recoverability and Estimated Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets
We review the carrying value of all long-lived assets, comprising right-of-use assets ("ROU assets"), building, capitalized software, leasehold improvements and equipment, and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. In addition, the Company reviews the useful lives of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these lives may be changed. The carrying value of these long-lived assets is $608.9 million and $568.9 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Income Taxes
The Company was included within Old IAC’s tax group for purposes of federal and consolidated state income tax return filings through June 30, 2020, the date of the MTCH Separation. For periods prior thereto, the income tax benefit and/or provision was computed for the Company on an as if standalone, separate return basis and payments to and refunds from Old IAC for the Company’s share of Old IAC’s consolidated federal and state tax return liabilities/receivables calculated on this basis have been reflected within cash flows from operating activities in the accompanying statement of cash flows.
The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the balance of the Company's net deferred tax liability is $50.4 million and $44.3 million, respectively.
The Company evaluates and accounts for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. Recognition (step one) occurs when the Company concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustainable upon examination. Measurement (step two) determines the amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. De-recognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when the Company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained. This measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, of $22.1 million and $20.3 million, respectively. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustment and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Although management currently believes changes to unrecognized tax benefits from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future.
The ultimate amount of deferred income tax assets realized and the amounts paid for deferred income tax liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits may vary from our estimates due to future changes in income tax law, state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities, as well as actual operating results of the Company that vary significantly from anticipated results.
Stock-Based Compensation
The stock-based compensation expense reflected in our statements of operations includes expense related to equity awards issued by certain of our subsidiaries (including awards assumed in acquisitions, including the Combination) and, for periods prior to the MTCH Separation, an allocation of expense from Old IAC related to awards issued to the Company's employees that were granted under various Old IAC stock and annual incentive plans. The form of awards granted to the Company's employees are principally stock options, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance-based RSUs, market-based RSUs, and restricted stock.
The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $197.2 million and $134.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Included in stock-based compensation expense in the year ended December 31, 2020 is the modification charge of $56.0 million related to the MTCH Separation. Included in stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is $28.2 million and $32.6 million, respectively, related to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor equity awards and Angie's List equity awards, both of which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards in the Combination, and the acceleration of certain converted equity awards resulting from the termination of Angie's List employees in connection with the Combination.
Stock-based compensation at the Company is complex due to our desire to attract, retain, inspire and reward our management team and employees at each of our subsidiaries, including those employed by recently acquired companies, by allowing them to benefit directly from the value they help to create. We accomplish these objectives, in part, by issuing equity awards denominated in the equity of our non-publicly subsidiaries as well as in IAC and ANGI. We further refine this approach by tailoring certain equity awards to the applicable circumstances. For example, we issue certain equity awards for which vesting is linked to the achievement of a performance target such as revenue or profits; these awards are referred to as performance-based awards. In other cases, we link the vesting of equity awards to the achievement of a value target for a subsidiary or IAC or ANGI’s stock price, as applicable; these awards are referred to as market-based awards. The nature and variety of these types of equity-based awards creates complexity in our determination of stock-based compensation expense.
In addition, acquisitions are an important part of the Company's growth strategy. These transactions may result in the modification of equity awards, which creates additional complexity and additional stock-based compensation expense. For example, the Combination resulted in the conversion of previously issued HomeAdvisor and Angie’s List awards into ANGI Homeservices awards, and the recognition of additional stock-based compensation expense. In addition, our spin-offs and internal reorganizations can also lead to modifications of equity awards and result in additional complexity and stock-based compensation expense. For example, the MTCH Separation resulted in the conversion of Old IAC denominated stock options into stock options to purchase IAC common stock and stock options to purchase New Match common stock in a manner that
preserved the spread value of the stock options immediately before and immediately after the adjustment, and the recognition of additional stock-based compensation expense.
Finally, the means by which we settle our equity-based awards also introduces complexity into our financial reporting. We provide a path to liquidity by settling the non-public subsidiary denominated awards in IAC or ANGI shares, as applicable. In addition, certain former ANGI subsidiary denominated awards and ANGI stock appreciation rights can be settled in IAC or ANGI awards at the Company’s election. These features increase the complexity of our earnings per share calculations.
The Company estimated the fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights issued (including those modified in connection with the MTCH Separation and the Combination) using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and, for those with a market condition, a lattice model. For stock options, including subsidiary denominated equity, the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date at fair value and expensed over the vesting term. The impact on stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, assuming a 1% increase in the risk-free interest rate, a 10% increase in the volatility factor and a one-year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding options would be an increase of $9.6 million, $18.8 million and $12.4 million, respectively. The Company also issues RSUs, performance-based RSUs, market-based RSUs and restricted stock. For RSUs, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term. For performance-based RSUs, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved. For market-based RSUs, a lattice model is used to estimate the value of the awards. For restricted stock, a lattice model is used to estimate the fair value of the award which is based on the satisfaction of IAC's stock price targets.
Investments in Equity Securities
The Company invests in equity securities as part of its investment strategy. Our equity securities, other than those of our consolidated subsidiaries and those accounted for under the equity method, are accounted for at fair value or under the measurement alternative of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities, with any changes to fair value recognized within other (expense) income, net each reporting period. Under the measurement alternative, equity investments without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar securities of the same issuer; value is generally determined based on a market approach as of the transaction date. A security will be considered identical or similar if it has identical or similar rights to the equity securities held by the Company. The Company reviews its investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values for impairment each reporting period when there are qualitative factors or events that indicate possible impairment. Factors we consider in making this determination include negative changes in industry and market conditions, financial performance, business prospects, and other relevant events and factors. When indicators of impairment exist, the Company prepares quantitative assessments of the fair value of our investments in equity securities, which require judgment and the use of estimates. When our assessment indicates that the fair value of the investment is below its carrying value, the Company writes down the investment to its fair value and records the corresponding charge within other (expense) income, net.
The carrying value of the Company’s equity securities without readily determinable fair values is $296.5 million and $348.0 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which is included in "Long-term investments" in the balance sheet. As described in the "COVID-19 Update and Impairments" section, in the first quarter of 2020 the Company recognized unrealized impairments or downward adjustments of $51.5 million related to certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values.
During the second and third quarters of 2020, the Company purchased 59.0 million shares of MGM. At December 31, 2020 the Company's investment in MGM is $1.9 billion. The fair value of the investment in MGM is remeasured each reporting period based upon MGM's closing stock price on the New York Stock Exchange and any unrealized gains or losses are included in the statement of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized an unrealized gain of $840.5 million on its investment in MGM.
The Company had an investment in Pinterest, which became a publicly-traded company in the second quarter of 2019. With effect from Pinterest's initial public offering, the Company's investment was accounted for as a marketable security. Prior to this, the Company accounted for its investment in Pinterest as an equity security without a readily determinable fair value. During 2019, the Company recognized a gain of $20.5 million on the sale of its remaining shares of Pinterest. In addition, during 2019, IAC recognized $18.5 million in net upward adjustments related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values.
