ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The discussion and analysis that follows should be read together with the section entitled “Forward Looking Statements” and our financial statements and the notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
Except for historical information, the matters discussed in this section are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and are based upon judgments concerning various factors that are beyond the Company’s control. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report.
Overview
On February 21, 2019, we entered into the Merger Agreement with OWP Merger Sub, our wholly-owned subsidiary, and OWP Ventures. Under the Merger Agreement, the acquisition of OWP Ventures by us was effected by the merger of OWP Merger Sub with and into OWP Ventures, with OWP Ventures being the surviving entity as our wholly-owned subsidiary. The Closing of the Merger occurred on February 21, 2019. As a result of the Merger (a) holders of the outstanding capital stock of OWP Ventures received an aggregate of 39,475,398 shares of our common stock; (b) options to purchase 825,000 shares of common stock of OWP Ventures at an exercise price of $0.50 automatically converted into options to purchase 825,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.50; (c) the outstanding principal and interest under a $300,000 convertible note issued by OWP Ventures became convertible, at the option of the holder, into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to the lesser of $0.424 per share or 80% of the price we sell our common stock in a future “Qualified Offering”; (d) 875,000 shares of our common stock owned by OWP Ventures prior to the Merger were cancelled; and (e) OWP Ventures’ chief operating officer became our chief operating officer and two of OWP Ventures’ directors became members of our board of directors.
OWP Ventures, Inc. is a holding company formed in Delaware on March 27, 2018 to enter and support the cannabis industry, and on May 30, 2018, it acquired One World Pharma S.A.S. One World Pharma S.A.S, is a licensed cannabis cultivation, production and distribution (export) company located in Popayán, Colombia (nearest major city is Cali). We plan to be a producer of raw cannabis and hemp plant ingredients for both medical and industrial uses across the globe. We have received licenses to cultivate, produce and distribute the raw ingredients of the cannabis and hemp plant for medicinal, scientific and industrial purposes. Specifically, we are one of the only companies in Colombia to receive seed, cultivation, extraction and export licenses from the Colombian government. Currently, we own approximately 30 acres and have a covered greenhouse built specifically to cultivate high-grade cannabis and hemp. In addition, we have entered into agreements with local farming co-operatives that include small farmers and indigenous tribe members, under which they will cultivate cannabis on up to approximately 140 acres of land using our seeds and propagation techniques, and sell their harvested products to us on an exclusive basis. We planted our first crop of cannabis in 2018, which we began harvesting in the first quarter of 2019 for the purpose of further research and development activities and quality control testing of the cannabis we have produced. We consummated our first sales and revenue beginning in the second quarter of 2020 with initial sales of fully registered non-psychoactive seeds.
The Merger was accounted for as a reverse merger (recapitalization) with OWP Ventures deemed to be the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, the financial statements included in this 10-K and the following discussion reflect the historical operations of OWP Ventures and its wholly-owned subsidiary One World Pharma S.A.S prior to the Merger, and that of the combined company following the Merger. The historical financial information for One World Pharma, Inc. (formerly Punto Group Corp.) prior to the Merger has been omitted.
Critical Accounting Policies
The establishment and consistent application of accounting policies is a vital component of accurately and fairly presenting our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), as well as ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing financial reporting. While there are rarely alternative methods or rules from which to select in establishing accounting and financial reporting policies, proper application often involves significant judgment regarding a given set of facts and circumstances and a complex series of decisions.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). All references to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) are in accordance with The FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
These statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which in the opinion of management are necessary for fair presentation of the information contained therein.
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the following entities, all of which were under common control and ownership at December 31, 2020:
(1) Holding company in the form of a corporation.
(2) Holding company in the form of a corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of One World Pharma, Inc.

The consolidated financial statements herein contain the operations of the wholly-owned subsidiaries listed above. The Company’s headquarters are located in Las Vegas, Nevada and substantially all of its production efforts are within Popayán, Colombia.
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of the Company is Columbian Peso (“COP”). The Company has maintained its financial statements using the functional currency, and translated those financial statements to the US Dollar throughout this report. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet dates. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Exchange gains or losses arising from foreign currency transactions are included in the determination of net income (loss) for the respective periods.
Comprehensive Income
The Company has adopted ASC 220, Reporting Comprehensive Income, which establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income, its components, and accumulated balances in a full-set of general-purpose financial statements. Accumulated other comprehensive income represents the accumulated balance of foreign currency translation adjustments.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years’ financial statements to conform to current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported results of operations or retained earnings.
Segment Reporting
ASC Topic 280, “Segment Reporting,” requires use of the “management approach” model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based on the way a company’s management organizes segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance. The Company operates as a single segment and will evaluate additional segment disclosure requirements as it expands its operations.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company adopted ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels are defined as follows:
- Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
- Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
- Level 3 inputs to valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair measurement.
The carrying value of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payables and accrued expenses are estimated by management to approximate fair value primarily due to the short-term nature of the instruments.
Cash in Excess of FDIC Insured Limits
The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Accounts are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000, under current regulations. The Company did not have any cash in excess of FDIC insured limits at December 31, 2020, and has not experienced any losses in such accounts.
Revenue Recognition
Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue from the commercial sales of products, licensing agreements and contracts to perform pilot studies by applying the following steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied.
There was no impact on the Company’s financial statements from ASC 606 for the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.
Inventory
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on a standard cost basis that approximates the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Market is determined based on net realizable value. Appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence, excessive levels, deterioration, and other factors in evaluating net realizable value. Our cannabis products consist of cannabis flower grown in-house, along with produced extracts.
Advertising Costs
The Company expenses the cost of advertising and promotions as incurred. Advertising and promotions expense was $143,341 and $114,244 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share
The basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss adjusted on an “as if converted” basis, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potential dilutive securities. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, potential dilutive securities had an anti-dilutive effect and were not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per common share.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to employees in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718 Stock Compensation (ASC 718) and Equity-Based Payments to Non-employees pursuant to ASC 2018-07 (ASC 2018-07). All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date of the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the counterparty’s performance is complete or the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached because of sufficiently large disincentives for non-performance.
Income Taxes
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered. The Company provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not.
Uncertain Tax Positions
In accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”), the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be capable of withstanding examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These standards prescribe a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. These standards also provide guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.
Various taxing authorities periodically audit the Company’s income tax returns. These audits include questions regarding the Company’s tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions, including state and local taxes, the Company records allowances for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which an allowance has been established, is audited and fully resolved. The Company has not yet undergone an examination by any taxing authorities.
The assessment of the Company’s tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with the Company’s various filing positions.

The following table summarizes our cash flows during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The decrease in funds used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to diminished operations in the current year due to the global effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The decrease in funds used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was due primarily to decreased purchases of fixed assets in the year ended December 31, 2020.
The decrease in funds provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was due primarily to decreased proceeds from the sale of our securities during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Satisfaction of our Cash Obligations for the Next 12 Months
As of December 31, 2020, we had $28,920 of cash on hand and negative working capital of $1,281,818. We do not currently have sufficient funds to fund our operations at their current levels for the next twelve months, however, we have received a commitment from ISIAH International, LLC, a company under the control of our CEO, Isiah L. Thomas, III, to fund us with $3,000,000 by July 12, 2021. As of April 14, 2021, we have received approximately, $1,250,000. As we implement our cannabis cultivation business and attempt to expand operational activities, we expect to continue to experience net negative cash flows from operations in amounts not now determinable, and will be required to obtain additional financing to fund operations. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital and to achieve sustainable revenues and profitable operations. Since inception, we have raised funds primarily through the sale of equity securities. We will need, and are currently seeking, additional funds to operate our business. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to us. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders. If we are unable to obtain additional funds, our ability to carry out and implement our planned business objectives and strategies will be significantly delayed, limited or may not occur. We cannot guarantee that we will become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability, given the competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we operate, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability and our failure to do so would adversely affect our business, including our ability to raise additional funds.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this 10-K have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no outstanding off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts. We do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.
