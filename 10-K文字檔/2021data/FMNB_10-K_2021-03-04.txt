Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following presents a discussion and analysis of Farmers’ financial condition and results of operations by its management. The review highlights the principal factors affecting earnings and the significant changes in balance sheet items for the years 2020, 2019 and 2018. Financial information for prior years is presented when appropriate. The objective of this financial review is to enhance the reader’s understanding of the accompanying tables and charts, the consolidated financial statements, notes to financial statements and financial statistics appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Where applicable, this discussion also reflects management’s insights of known events and trends that have or may reasonably be expected to have a material effect on Farmers’ business, financial condition or results of operations.

Results of Operations
Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The Company’s net income totaled $41.9 million during 2020, compared to $35.8 million for 2019. On a per share basis, diluted earnings per share were $1.47 as compared to $1.28 diluted earnings per share for 2019. Return on average assets and return on average equity were 1.46% and 12.80%, respectively, for the year ending December 31, 2020, compared to 1.50% and 12.56% for 2019. The return on average tangible equity, excluding acquisition costs, is a non GAAP measure and increased from 14.88% in 2019 to 16.00% in 2020.
On January 7, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Maple Leaf Financial, Inc. (“Maple Leaf”), the parent company of Geauga Savings Bank, with branches located in Cuyahoga and Geauga Counties in Ohio. The transaction involved both cash and 1,398,229 shares of stock totaling $43.0 million. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, common shareholders of Maple Leaf had the right to receive $640.00 in cash or 45.5948 common shares, without par value, of the Company, subject to an overall limitation of 50% of the Maple Leaf common shares being exchanged for Farmers common shares and 50% exchanged for cash. Holders of outstanding and unexercised warrants to purchase Maple Leaf Common Shares received an amount in cash equal to the excess of $640.00 over $370.00, the exercise price of such warrants. At January 7, 2020, Maple Leaf had total assets of $277.0 million, which included gross loans of $182.1 million, deposits of $183.1 million and equity of $32.1 million.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income, the principal source of the Company’s earnings, represents the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. For 2020, taxable equivalent net interest income increased $14.1 million, or 16.6%, from 2019. Interest-earning assets averaged $2.664 billion during 2020, increasing $451.3 million compared to 2019. The Company’s interest-bearing liabilities increased 19.2% from $1.656 billion in 2019 to $1.974 billion in 2020.
The Company finances its earning assets with a combination of interest-bearing and interest-free funds. The interest-bearing funds are composed of deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Interest paid for the use of these funds is the second factor in the net interest income equation. Interest-free funds, such as demand deposits and stockholders’ equity, require no interest expense and, therefore, contribute significantly to net interest income.
The profit margin, or spread, on invested funds is a key performance measure. The Company monitors two key performance indicators - net interest spread and net interest margin. The net interest spread represents the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest spread in 2020 was 3.49%, decreasing from 3.53% in 2019. The net interest margin represents the overall profit margin - net interest income as a percentage of total interest-earning assets. This performance indicator gives effect to interest earned for all investable funds including the substantial volume of interest-free funds. For 2020, the net interest margin, measured on a fully taxable equivalent basis, decreased to 3.70%, compared to 3.82% in 2019. The net interest margin, excluding the impact of amortization and accretion from acquisitions (non-GAAP), decreased 5 basis points and 4 basis points to 3.65% and 3.78% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The accretion added $109.8 thousand and $75.9 thousand per month during 2020 and 2019 and will continue over the next several years. The net interest margin is also impacted by the PPP loan program. Excluding the impact of the PPP loans, net interest margin (non-GAAP), decreased 1 basis point to 3.69% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The decrease in net interest margin is mainly due to pressure on decreasing rates as the Federal Reserve Bank continued to cut the federal funds interest rate in 2020. The Federal Reserve Bank cut the target federal funds rate to 0.00% - 0.25%. Total taxable equivalent interest income was $114.7 million for 2020, which is $10.6 million more than the $104.1 million reported in 2019. This increase is mainly due to the increase in average earning assets due to organic growth and the acquisition of Maple Leaf. In comparing the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019, yields on earning assets decreased 40 basis points while the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased 36 basis points. Average loans increased $305.1 million, or 17.4%, in 2020, however, the loan yield decreased 30 basis points to 4.79%. Tax equated income from securities, federal funds and other increased $1.3 million, or 9.1%, in 2020. Farmers saw its yields on these assets decrease from 3.22% in 2019 to 2.65% in 2020 and the average balance of investment securities and federal funds sold also increased from $454.5 million in 2019 to $600.7 million in 2020.
The decrease in the federal funds interest rate as mentioned above reduced the cost of short-term borrowings and interest-bearing deposits during 2020. Total interest expense amounted to $16.1 million for 2020, a 17.7% decrease from $19.6 million reported in 2019. Interest-bearing deposits increased $334.5 million or 21.8% and decreases in interest rates paid on deposits resulted in a $2.5 million or 14.7% decrease in interest expense on deposit balances. Other borrowings balances decreased $16.2 million or 13.6% and the interest expense related to these borrowings decreased $1.0 million or 36.1%. The total cost of interest-bearing deposits and borrowings decreased from 1.18% in 2019 to 0.82% in 2020.
Management will continue to evaluate future changes in interest rates and the shape of the treasury yield curve so that assets and liabilities may be priced accordingly to minimize the impact on the net interest margin.
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income increased by $8.6 million or 29.9% in 2020. The increase in noninterest income is mainly due to net gains on the sale of loans increasing from $4.4 million in 2019 to $12.3 million in 2020 and the increase in debit card and EFT fees increasing from $3.5 million in 2019 to $3.9 million in 2020. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in income from service charges on deposit accounts of $832 thousand. The Bank and the Company expect noninterest income to remain steady or decrease slightly during 2021 as management expects the gain on sales of mortgage loans to be reduced in 2021.
Noninterest Expenses
Noninterest expense for 2020 was $74.0 million, compared to $65.5 million in 2019, representing an increase of $8.5 million, or 13.0%. Most of the increase was from salaries and employee benefits, which grew $2.6 million or 7.1%, mainly due to a temporary increase in FTE counts from the acquisition of Maple Leaf, employee bonuses paid as a result of COVID-19 and annual merit increases. Other operating expenses increased by $2.0 million, or 22.2% as a result of increased mortgage servicing rights expense and captive insurance company losses, as members of the pool made claims for the COVID-19 pandemic. These increases were slightly offset by a drop in professional fees of $389 thousand, or 12.5%, and litigation settlement expenses of $505 thousand. Excluding expenses related to acquisition activities (non-GAAP), noninterest expenses measured as a percentage of average assets decreased from 2.75% in 2019 to 2.58% in 2020.
The Company’s tax equivalent efficiency ratio for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020 was 52.82%, compared to 56.59% for the same period in 2019. The main factors leading to the improvement in the efficiency ratio was the increase in net interest income and noninterest income, along with the stabilized level of noninterest expenses relative to average assets as explained in the preceding paragraph. The efficiency ratio is calculated as follows: non-interest expense divided by the sum of tax equivalent net interest income plus non-interest income, excluding security gains and losses and intangible amortization. This ratio is a measure of the expense incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. Management will continue to closely monitor and keep the increases in other expenses to a minimum.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense totaled $8.4 million for 2020 and $7.3 million in 2019. Income taxes are computed using the appropriate effective tax rates for each period. The effective tax rates are less than the statutory tax rate primarily due to nontaxable interest and dividend income. The effective income tax rate was 16.7% for 2020 and 17.0% for 2019. The decreased effective tax rate is due to additions to the non-taxable municipal securities portfolio. We anticipate that the effective rate in 2021 will be in the range of 15% to 17%. Refer to Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the effective tax rate.
Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
The Company’s net income totaled $35.8 million during 2019, compared to $32.6 million for 2018. On a per share basis, diluted earnings per share were $1.28 as compared to $1.16 diluted earnings per share for 2018. Return on average assets and return on average equity were 1.50% and 12.56%, respectively, for the year ending December 31, 2019, compared to 1.46% and 13.13% for 2018. The return on average tangible equity, excluding acquisition costs, is a non GAAP measure and decreased from 15.95% in 2018 to 14.88% in 2019.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income, the principal source of the Company’s earnings, represents the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. For 2019, taxable equivalent net interest income increased $4.2 million, or 5.2%, from 2018. Interest-earning assets averaged $2.212 billion during 2019, increasing $137.8 million compared to 2018. The Company’s interest-bearing liabilities increased 6.7% from $1.553 billion in 2018 to $1.656 billion in 2019.
The Company finances its earning assets with a combination of interest-bearing and interest-free funds. The interest-bearing funds are composed of deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Interest paid for the use of these funds is the second factor in the net interest income equation. Interest-free funds, such as demand deposits and stockholders’ equity, require no interest expense and, therefore, contribute significantly to net interest income.
The profit margin, or spread, on invested funds is a key performance measure. The Company monitors two key performance indicators - net interest spread and net interest margin. The net interest spread represents the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest spread in 2019 was 3.53%, decreasing from 3.66% in 2018. The net interest margin represents the overall profit margin - net interest income as a percentage of total interest-earning assets. This performance indicator gives effect to interest earned for all investable funds including the substantial volume of interest-free funds. For 2019, the net interest margin, measured on a fully taxable equivalent basis, decreased to 3.82%, compared to 3.87% in 2018. The net interest margin, excluding the impact of amortization and accretion from acquisitions (non-GAAP), decreased 5 basis point to 3.78% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The accretion added $75.9 thousand per month during 2019 and will continue over the next several years.
The decrease in net interest margin is mainly due to pressure on decreasing rates as the Federal Reserve Bank continued to cut the federal funds interest rate in 2019. The federal funds interest rate decreased 3 times for a total of 75 basis points during the year. Total taxable equivalent interest income was $104.1 million for 2019, which is $10.5 million more than the $93.6 million reported in 2018. In comparing the years ending December 31, 2019 and 2018, yields on earning assets increased 20 basis points while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased 33 basis points. Average loans increased $125.3 million, or 7.7%, in 2019, and the loan yield increased 18 basis points to 5.09%. Tax equated income from securities, federal funds and other increased $1.2 million, or 8.9%, in 2019. Farmers saw its yields on these assets increase from 3.04% in 2018 to 3.22% in 2019 and the average balance of investment securities and federal funds sold also increased from $442.0 million in 2018 to $454.5 million in 2019.
The decrease in the federal funds interest rate as mentioned above reduced the cost of short-term borrowings during 2019. Even with that rate decrease, total interest expense amounted to $19.6 million for 2019, a 47.8% increase from $13.3 million reported in 2018. Interest-bearing deposits increased $271.6 million or 21.5% and increases in interest rates paid on deposits resulted in an $8.7 million or 107.1% increase in interest expense on deposit balances. Other borrowings balances decreased $168.1 million or 58.4% and the interest expense related to these borrowings decreased $2.4 million or 46.4%. The total cost of interest-bearing deposits and borrowings increased from 0.85% in 2018 to 1.18% in 2019.
Management will continue to evaluate future changes in interest rates and the shape of the treasury yield curve so that assets and liabilities may be priced accordingly to minimize the impact on the net interest margin.
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income increased by $3.1 million or 12.2% in 2019. The increase in noninterest income is due to several factors. Trust fee income increased from $7.1 million to $7.5 million, representing an increase of $349 thousand or 4.9%, resulting from growth in new customers and an increase in market value of trust assets. Commissions from the sale of investment products increased $303 thousand or 27.5% during 2019. Net gains on the sale of loans increased from $2.7 million in 2018 to $4.4 million in 2019, or 63.0%, and insurance agency commissions increased to $2.9 million compared to $2.6 million in 2018. These increases were offset by a decrease in income from retirement plan consulting fees of $195 thousand and a decrease in security gains of $229 thousand. The Bank and the Company expect noninterest income to increase during 2020 as management continues to focus on growing the various sources of noninterest income.
Noninterest Expenses
Noninterest expense for 2019 was $65.5 million, compared to $62.7 million in 2018, representing an increase of $2.7 million, or 4.4%. Most of the increase was from salaries and employee benefits, which grew $1.2 million or 3.3%, mainly due to merit increases in salaries. Other operating expenses increased by $628 thousand and merger related expenses increased by $352 thousand. The Company also incurred $505 thousand in litigation expense that is not expected in future years. These increases were offset by a drop in FDIC insurance of $568 thousand and telephone and data expense of $113 thousand. Excluding expenses related to acquisition activities, noninterest expenses measured as a percentage of average assets decreased from 2.82% in 2018 to 2.75% in 2019.
The Company’s tax equivalent efficiency ratio for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2019 was 56.59%, compared to 57.93% for the same period in 2018. The main factors leading to the improvement in the efficiency ratio was the increase in net interest income and noninterest income, along with the stabilized level of noninterest expenses relative to average assets as explained in the preceding paragraph. The efficiency ratio is calculated as follows: non-interest expense divided by the sum of tax equivalent net interest income plus non-interest income, excluding security gains and losses and intangible amortization. This ratio is a measure of the expense incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. Management will continue to closely monitor and keep the increases in other expenses to a minimum.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense totaled $7.3 million for 2019 and $5.7 million in 2018. Income taxes are computed using the appropriate effective tax rates for each period. The effective tax rates are less than the statutory tax rate primarily due to nontaxable interest and dividend income. The effective income tax rate was 17.0% for 2019 and 14.9% for 2018. The increased effective tax rate is due to income tax liability adjustments. Refer to Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the effective tax rate.
Loan Portfolio
Maturities and Sensitivities of Loans to Interest Rates
The following schedule shows the composition of loans and the percentage of loans in each category at the dates indicated. Balances include unamortized loan origination fees and costs.
The following schedule sets forth maturities based on remaining scheduled repayments of principal for commercial, commercial real estate and agricultural loans listed above as of December 31, 2020:
The amounts of commercial, commercial real estate and agricultural loans as of December 31, 2020, based on remaining scheduled repayments of principal, are shown in the following table:
Total loans were $2.1 billion at year-end 2020, compared to $1.8 billion at year-end 2019 representing an increase of 14.7%. Excluding the $182.1 million of loans added from the Maple Leaf acquisition, loan growth was 4.7%. The increase in loans is a direct result of Farmers’ focus on loan growth utilizing a talented lending and credit team, while adhering to a sound underwriting discipline and the addition of PPP loans in 2020. Most of the increase in loans has occurred in the commercial real estate, agricultural, residential real estate and commercial loan portfolios. Loans comprised 77.5% of the Bank’s average earning assets in 2020, compared to 79.5% in 2019. The product mix in the loan portfolio includes commercial loans comprising 19.3%, residential real estate loans 25.2%, commercial real estate loans 34.3%, consumer loans 10.0% and agricultural loans 11.2% at December 31, 2020, compared with 14.1%, 27.6%, 34.0%, 11.9% and 12.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2019.
Loans contributed 86.1% of total taxable equivalent interest income in 2020 and 86.0% in 2019. Loan yields were 4.79% in 2020, 48 basis points greater than the average rate for total earning assets. Management recognizes that while the loan portfolio holds some of the Bank’s’ highest yielding assets, it is inherently the most risky portfolio. Accordingly, management attempts to balance credit risk versus return with conservative credit standards. Management has developed and maintains comprehensive underwriting guidelines and a loan review function that monitors credits during and after the approval process. To minimize risks associated with changes in the borrower’s future repayment capacity, the Bank generally requires scheduled periodic principal and interest payments on all types of loans and normally requires collateral. Commercial loans at December 31, 2020 increased 57.0% from year-end 2019 with outstanding balances of $401.0 million. The Bank’s commercial loans are granted to customers within the immediate trade area of the Bank. The mix is diverse, covering a wide range of borrowers, business types and local municipalities. The Bank monitors and controls concentrations within a particular industry or segment of the economy. These loans are made for purposes such as equipment purchases, capital and leasehold improvements, the purchase of inventory, general working capital and small business lines of credit.
Residential real estate mortgage loans increased 4.8% to $523.3 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $499.3 million in 2019. Farmers originated both fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgages during 2020. Fixed rate terms are generally limited to fifteen-year terms while adjustable rate products are offered with maturities up to thirty years.
Commercial real estate loans increased from $615.5 million at December 31, 2019 to $712.8 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $97.3 million or 15.8%. The Company’s commercial real estate loan portfolio includes loans for owner occupied and non-owner occupied real estate. These loans are made to finance properties such as office and industrial buildings, hotels and retail shopping centers.
The growth in the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios was mainly due the PPP loan program and loans added in the acquisition of Maple Leaf.
Agricultural loans increased from $226.3 million in 2019 to $232.0 million in 2020, an increase of $5.8 million or 2.6%. The Company’s agricultural loan portfolio contains a diverse mix of dairy, crops, land, poultry and cattle loans.
Summary of Loan Loss Experience
The following is an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated:
Provisions charged to operations amounted to $9.1 million in 2020, compared to $2.5 million in 2019, an increase of $6.7 million. The larger provision for the current year was mainly a result of current economic conditions resulting from the global outbreak of COVID-19. In determining the estimate of the allowance for loan losses, management computes the historical loss percentage based upon the loss history of the past 12 quarters. The Company believes that using a loss history of the previous 12 quarters helps mitigate volatility in the timing of charge-offs and better reflects probable incurred losses. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1.4 million, $112 thousand or 7.2% less than net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2019. The allowance for loan losses to total loans increased to 1.07% at December 31, 2020 compared to 0.80% at December 31, 2019. When the acquired loans from previous mergers are excluded the ratio is 1.23% at December 31, 2020 and 0.90% at December 31, 2019. The increase can be attributed to the uncertainty surrounding the current economic environment caused by the pandemic. Additionally, when loans collectively evaluated for impairment, which excludes acquired loans, are compared to the allowance for loan losses for loans collectively evaluated for impairment the ratio is 1.20% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 0.89% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Nonperforming loans to total loans increased from 0.35% at December 31, 2019 to 0.67% at December 31, 2020.
In accordance with the accounting relief provisions of CARES and subsequent provisions of the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HEROES) Acts, the Bank postponed the adoption of the current expected credit losses (“CECL”) accounting standard, in 2020, primarily due to the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic is having on the economy and the lack of reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2021. The Company recorded the one-time adjustment to equity, to comply with the ASU adoption, which increased the allowance for loan losses between 5% and 10% as expected. Management does not expect this amount to change during the first quarter of 2021 but retains the option to make adjustments if new information becomes available.
The provision for loan losses charged to operating expense is based on management’s judgment after taking into consideration all factors connected with the collectability of the existing loan portfolio. Management evaluates the loan portfolio in light of economic conditions, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, industry standards and other relevant factors. Specific factors considered by management in determining the amounts charged to operating expenses include previous charge-off experience, the status of past due interest and principal payments, the quality of financial information supplied by loan customers and the general condition of the industries in the community to which loans have been made.
The allowance for loan losses increased $7.7 million during the year. The increased provision is determined to be required as a result of the impact of increased negative factors that exist in the current economic environment, resulting from the global pandemic.
At December 31, 2020, commercial loans collectively evaluated for impairment totaled $424.4 million with an allowance allocation of $4.5 million compared to commercial loans collectively evaluated for impairment of $290.0 million with an allowance for loan losses of $2.3 million at December 31, 2019. The commercial loan portfolio experienced a provision of $3.0 million, compared to a $417 thousand provision in 2019. Impaired loans are carried at the fair value of the underlying collateral, less estimated disposition costs, if repayment of the loan is expected to be solely dependent on the sale of the collateral. Otherwise, impaired loans are carried at the present value of expected cash flows.
Typically, commercial and commercial real estate loans are identified as impaired when they become ninety days past due, or earlier if management believes it is probable that the Company will not collect all amounts due under the terms of the loan agreement. When Farmers identifies a loan as impaired and concludes that the loan is collateral dependent, Farmers performs an internal collateral valuation as an interim measure. Farmers typically obtains an external appraisal to validate its internal collateral valuation as soon as is practical and adjusts the associated specific loss reserve, if necessary.
The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans at December 31, 2020 was 160.1%, compared to 228.32% at December 31, 2019. This was due to increases in nonaccrual loans in all loan portfolios. The balance in the allowance for loan losses also increased in 2020 to $22.1 million from $14.5 million in 2019. This is mainly due to the uncertainty surrounding the current economic environment in these pandemic times and to a lesser extent the increased loan portfolio size.
The Company has forgone interest income of approximately $516 thousand from nonaccrual loans as of December 31, 2020 that would have been earned, over the life of the loans, if all loans had performed in accordance with their original terms.
The Company offered three month deferrals upon request by borrowers in good standing that were impacted by COVID-19 in accordance with interagency guidance and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The deferral requests began in the middle of March 2020 and concluded at the end of the three month deferral period. The Company granted a second three month deferral period. The second deferral period was offered to a select group of customers within specific industry codes that may have a higher credit risk. See Note 4 - (Loans) for further details and discussion.
Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding decreased from 0.09% for 2019 to 0.04% for 2020 as a result of the larger loan portfolio. Net charge-offs decreased from $1.6 million in 2019 to $1.4 million in 2020. An increase in gross charge-offs was experienced in the commercial loan and commercial real estate loan portfolios of $212 thousand and $77 thousand, respectively, but that was offset by decreases in the residential real estate loan and consumer loan portfolios of $228 thousand and $355 thousand, respectively.
The following table summarizes the Company’s allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the past five years:
The allowance allocated to each of the four loan categories should not be interpreted as an indication that charge-offs in 2020 occurred in the same proportions or that the allocation indicates future charge-off trends. The allowance allocated to the one-to-four family real estate loan category and the consumer loan category is based upon the Company’s allowance methodology for homogeneous loans, and increases and decreases in the balances of those portfolios. In previous years, the indirect installment loan category has represented the largest percentage of loan losses. The consumer loan category represents approximately 10.0% of total loans and in 2020, the gross charge-offs accounted for 65.6% of the losses of the entire loan portfolio. For the commercial loan category, which represents 19.3% of the total loan portfolio, management relies on the Bank’s internal loan review procedures and allocates accordingly based on loan classifications. The gross charge-offs in the commercial loan portfolio, was $412 thousand for 2020.
There were no loans other than those identified above, that management has known information about possible credit problems of borrowers and their ability to comply with the loan repayment terms. Management is actively monitoring certain borrowers’ financial condition and loans which management wants to more closely monitor due to special circumstances. These loans and their potential loss exposure have been considered in management’s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.
Loan Commitments and Lines of Credit
In the normal course of business, the Bank has extended various commitments for credit. Commitments for mortgages, revolving lines of credit and letters of credit generally are extended for a period of one month up to one year. Normally, no fees are charged on any unused portion, but an annual fee of two percent is charged for the issuance of a letter of credit.
As of December 31, 2020, there were no concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans that are not disclosed as a category of loans. As of that date, there were also no other interest-earning assets that are either nonaccrual, past due, restructured or non-performing.
Investment Securities
The investment securities portfolio increased $142.3 million in 2020. This increase is a result of asset growth in 2020, deposit growth as a result of banking customers seeking safety, additional cash in customer’s hands as a result of the federal stimulus legislation and the maintaining of the security portfolio at a constant level, as a percentage of total assets. The Company’s investment strategy is to maintain a diverse investment security portfolio with a higher concentration in tax-free municipal securities and mortgage-backed securities that are issued by U.S. Government sponsored enterprises. Farmers sold $18.9 million in securities in 2020, resulting in net security gains of $385 thousand. Farmers recognized market appreciation on faster paying mortgage-backed securities and recognized losses on lower rated municipal securities, and reinvested in new mortgage-backed securities and higher rated municipal securities to further diversify the securities portfolio. The Company has an investment subsidiary to hold municipal securities and take advantage of more favorable tax treatment. At December 31, 2020, the Investment entity had a balance of $172.3 million in general market tax-free municipal securities.
Farmers’ objective in managing the investment portfolio is to preserve and enhance corporate liquidity through investment in primarily short and intermediate term securities which are readily marketable and of the highest credit quality. In general, investment in securities is limited to those funds the Bank feels it has in excess of funds used to satisfy loan demand and operating considerations.
The Volcker Rule places limits on the trading activity of insured depository institutions and entities affiliated with a depository institution, subject to certain exceptions. The Bank does not engage in any of the trading activities or own any of the types of funds regulated by the Volcker Rule.
Mortgage-backed securities are created by the pooling of mortgages and issuance of a security. Mortgage-backed securities typically represent a participation interest in a pool of single-family or multi-family mortgages. Prepayment estimates for mortgage-backed securities are performed at purchase to ensure that prepayment assumptions are reasonable considering the underlying collateral for the mortgage-backed securities at issue and current mortgage interest rates and to determine the yield and estimated maturity of the mortgage-backed security portfolio. Prepayments that are faster than anticipated may shorten the life of the security and may result in faster amortization of any premiums paid and thereby reduce the net yield on such securities. During periods of increasing mortgage interest rates, refinancing generally slows as do the prepayments of the underlying mortgages and the related security. All holdings of mortgage-backed securities were issued by U.S. Government sponsored enterprises.
The following table shows the carrying value of investment securities by type of obligation at the dates indicated:
Type
A summary of debt securities held at December 31, 2020 classified according to maturity and including weighted average yield for each range of maturities is set forth below:
(1)
The weighted average yield has been computed by dividing the total contractual interest income adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount over the life of the security by the par value of the securities outstanding. The weighted average yield of tax-exempt obligations of states and political subdivisions has been calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis. The amounts of adjustments to interest which are based on the statutory tax rate of 21% were $9 thousand, $24 thousand, $146 thousand and $2.2 million for the four ranges of maturities.
(2)
Payments based on contractual maturity.
Premises and Equipment
Premises and equipment had a net increase of $1.8 million in 2020 as a result of additions of $2.2 million, disposals of $579 thousand and depreciation of $1.5 million. In addition, $1.7 million in net lease obligations were capitalized and added to premises and equipment during 2020.
Deposits
Deposits represent the Company’s principal source of funds. The deposit base consists of demand deposits, savings, money market accounts and other time deposits, including $32.0 million in brokered time deposits which were added for the first time in 2018. Brokered deposits were added as an additional way to control and reduce the Company’s cost of funds. During the year, the Company’s average total interest-bearing deposits increased from $1.966 billion in 2019 to $2.417 billion in 2020, representing an increase of 23.0%, with the Geauga acquisition adding $183.3 million. Average noninterest demand deposits increased $116.9 million in 2020. Average interest bearing demand deposits increased $215.0 million, while average savings deposits increased $51.3 million since December 31, 2019. Average time deposits increased $79.0 million in 2020. The Company’s focus is on core deposit growth and Farmers will continue to price deposit rates to remain competitive within the market and to retain customers. At December 31, 2020, core deposits - savings and money market accounts, time deposits less than $250 thousand, demand deposits and interest bearing demand deposits represented approximately 93.4% of total deposits.
Bank Owned Life Insurance
Farmers’ owns bank owned life insurance policies on the lives of certain members of management. The purpose of this investment is to help fund the costs of employee benefit plans. During 2020, the Bank purchased an additional $15 million in bank owned life insurance. The cash surrender value of these policies was $51.3 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $35.5 million at December 31, 2019.
Borrowings
Average short-term borrowings decreased $75.4 million or 78.4% since December 31, 2019 as a result of using brokered time deposits in place of more expensive FHLB borrowings. Additional organic deposits, as discussed above, helped reduced the need for the short-term borrowings. Average long-term borrowings increased $59.1 million as maturing short-term FHLB advances were refinanced to capitalize on the favorable long-term interest rates. See Note 12 and 13 within Item 8 of this Annual report on Form 10-K for additional detail.
Contractual Obligations, Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The following table presents, as of December 31, 2020, the Company’s significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date. The payment amounts represent those amounts contractually due to the recipient and do not include any unamortized premiums or discounts or other similar carrying value adjustments. Further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in the referenced note to the consolidated financial statements.
There is also a $796 thousand additional commitment to SBIC investment funds over the next several years. The payments have no predetermined due dates at year end 2020. Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements discusses in greater detail other commitments and contingencies and the various obligations that exists under those agreements. Examples of these commitments and contingencies include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.
At December 31, 2020, the Company did not engage in derivatives or hedging contracts that may expose the Company to liabilities greater than the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. Management’s policy is to not engage in derivatives contracts for speculative trading purposes. The Company does utilize interest-rate swaps as a way of helping manage interest rate risk and not as derivatives for trading purposes. See Note 22 within Item 8 of this Annual report on Form 10-K for additional detail.
Capital Resources
Total Stockholders’ Equity increased 17.0% from $299.3 million at December 31, 2019 to $350.1 million in 2020. The increase is due to the net income addition to retained earnings less the amount of dividends paid. During the year, shareholders received a total of $0.44 per share cash dividends paid in the past four quarters, a 15.8% increase compared to the $0.38 cash dividends per share paid in 2019. Book value increased 14.8% from $10.82 per share at December 31, 2019 to $12.42 per share at December 31, 2020. The Company’s tangible book value also increased from $9.28 per share at December 31, 2019 to $10.66 per share at December 31, 2020, an increase of 14.9%.
The Bank, as a national chartered bank, is subject to the dividend restrictions set forth by the OCC. The OCC must approve declaration of any dividends in excess of the sum of profits for the current year and retained net profits for the preceding two years (as defined). Farmers and Farmers Bank are required to maintain minimum amounts of capital to total “risk weighted” assets, as defined by the banking regulators. At December 31, 2020, under the new minimum capital requirements associated with the Basel Committee on capital and liquidity regulation (Basel III), Farmers Bank and Farmers are required to have minimum capital ratios. Actual and minimum ratios are detailed in Note 16 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Farmers Bank and Farmers had capital ratios above the minimum levels at December 31, 2020 and 2019. At year-end 2020 and 2019, the most recent regulatory notifications categorized Farmers Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.
During 2013, the Federal banking regulators approved a final rule to implement revised capital adequacy standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly called Basel III, and to address relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule strengthens the definition of regulatory capital, increases risk-based capital requirements, makes selected changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets, and adjusts the prompt corrective action thresholds. Community banking organizations, such as the Company and the Bank, became subject to the new rule on January 1, 2015 and certain provisions of the new rule will be phased in over the period of 2015 through 2019. The Bank has retained, through a one-time election, the prior treatment for most accumulated other comprehensive income, such that unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale that did not affect regulatory capital amounts and ratios. As mentioned in the prior paragraph, the Bank falls within the new regulatory capital ratio guidelines.
Critical Accounting Policies
The Company follows financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and conform to general practices within the banking industry. Some of these accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. Critical accounting policies are those policies that require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company has identified three accounting policies that are critical accounting policies and an understanding of these policies is necessary to understand the financial statements. These policies relate to determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, if there is any impairment of goodwill and other intangibles, and estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with any merger activity. Additional information regarding these policies is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, including Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 4 (Loans) and Note 2 (Business Combinations), and the section above captioned “Loan Portfolio.” Management believes that the judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time.
Farmers maintains an allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is presented as a reserve against loans on the balance sheets. Loan losses are charged off against the allowance for loan losses, while
recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance for loan losses. A provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management’s periodic evaluation of adequacy of the allowance. The provision for credit losses provides for probable losses on loans.
Estimating the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The loan portfolio represents the largest asset category on the consolidated balance sheets. Management’s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses considers individually impaired loans, pools of homogeneous loans with similar risk characteristics and other environmental risk factors.
Pools of homogeneous loans with similar risk characteristics are assessed for probable losses. Probable losses are estimated through application of historical loss experience. Historical loss experience data used to establish loss estimates may not precisely correspond to the current portfolio. As a result, the historical loss experience used in the allowance analysis may not be representative of actual unrealized losses inherent in the portfolio.
Management also evaluates the impact of environmental factors which pose additional risks that may not adequately be addressed in the analyses described above. Such environmental factors could include: levels of, and trends in, delinquencies and impaired loans, charge-offs and recoveries; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in lending policies and procedures including those for underwriting, collection, charge-off and recovery; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; industry and geographic conditions; concentrations of credit such as, but not limited to, local industries, their employees and suppliers; or any other common risk factor that might affect loss experience across one or more components of the portfolio. The determination of this component of the allowances requires considerable management judgment. To the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates, additional provision for credit losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods. The “Loan Portfolio” section of this financial review includes a discussion of the factors driving changes in the allowance for loan losses during the current period.
Management believes that the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets also involves a higher degree of judgment than most other significant accounting policies. U.S. GAAP establishes standards for the amortization of acquired intangible assets and the impairment assessment of goodwill. Goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible assets in the business acquired. The Company’s goodwill relates to the value inherent in the banking industry and that value is dependent upon the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to provide quality, cost-effective services in a competitive marketplace. The goodwill value is supported by revenue that is in part driven by the volume of business transacted. A decrease in earnings resulting from a decline in the customer base or the inability to deliver cost-effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill that could adversely impact earnings in future periods. U.S. GAAP requires an annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The fair value of the goodwill is estimated by reviewing the past and projected operating results for the subsidiaries and comparable industry information. At December 31, 2020, on a consolidated basis, Farmers had intangibles of $3.8 million subject to amortization and $45.8 million of goodwill, which was not subject to periodic amortization.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Developments
Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements discusses new accounting policies adopted by Farmers during 2019 and 2020 and the expected impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted. To the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affects financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, the impacts are discussed in the applicable sections of this financial review and notes to the consolidated financial statements.
