Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and other parts of this prospectus contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements included in this prospectus are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth in the section captioned “Risk Factors” in Annual Report. The following should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements included elsewhere herein.
Overview
We are a clinical stage biotechnology company that develops cyclodextrin-based products for the treatment of disease. We filed a Type II Drug Master File with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in 2014 for our lead drug candidate, Trappsol® Cyclo™ (hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin) as a treatment for Niemann-Pick Type C disease (“NPC”). NPC is a rare and fatal cholesterol metabolism disease that impacts the brain, lungs, liver, spleen, and other organs. In 2015, we launched an International Clinical Program for Trappsol® Cyclo™ as a treatment for NPC. In 2016, we filed an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) with the FDA, which described our Phase I clinical plans for a randomized, double blind, parallel group study at a single clinical site in the U.S. The Phase I study evaluated the safety of Trappsol® Cyclo™ along with markers of cholesterol metabolism and markers of NPC during a 14-week treatment period of intravenous administration of Trappsol® Cyclo™ every two weeks to participants 18 years of age and older. The IND was approved by the FDA in September 2016, and in January 2017 the FDA granted Fast Track designation to Trappsol® Cyclo™ for the treatment of NPC. Initial patient enrollment in the U.S. Phase I study commenced in September 2017. Enrollment in this study was completed in October 2019, and in May 2020 we announced Top Line data showing a favorable safety and tolerability profile for Trappsol® Cyclo™ in this study.
We have also filed Clinical Trial Applications for a Phase I/II clinical study with several European regulatory bodies, including those in the United Kingdom, Sweden and Italy, and in Israel, all of which have approved our applications. The Phase I/II study is evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Trappsol® Cyclo™ through a range of clinical outcomes, including neurologic, and respiratory, in addition to measurements of cholesterol metabolism and markers of NPC. The European/Israel study is similar to the U.S. study, providing for the administration of Trappsol® Cyclo™ intravenously to NPC patients every two weeks in a double-blind, randomized trial but it differs in that the study period is for 48 weeks (24 doses). The first patient was dosed in this study in July 2017, and in February 2020, we announced completion of enrollment of 12 patients in this study. In September 2020, we released positive data from the seven patients who completed the trial, supporting the efficacy of Trappsol® Cyclo™ in treating NPC patients.
Additionally, in February 2020 we had a face-to-face “Type C” meeting with the FDA with respect to the initiation of our pivotal Phase III clinical trial of Trappsol® Cyclo™ based on the clinical data obtained to date. At that meeting, we also discussed with the FDA submitting a New Drug Application (NDA) under Section 505(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for the treatment of NPC in pediatric and adult patients with Trappsol® Cyclo™. A similar request was submitted to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) in February 2020, seeking scientific advice and protocol assistance from the EMA for proceeding with a Phase III clinical trial in Europe. In October 2020 we received a “Study May Proceed” notification from the FDA with respect to the proposed Phase III clinical trial. We currently estimate that in the event our pivotal Phase III trial proceeds as planned and provides further data supporting the safety and efficacy of Trappsol® Cyclo™ in the treatment of NPC, we may obtain regulatory approval of Trappsol® Cyclo™ as early as 2023.
Preliminary data from our clinical studies suggest that Trappsol® Cyclo™ releases cholesterol from cells, crosses the blood-brain-barrier in individuals suffering from NPC, and results in neurological and neurocognitive benefits and other clinical improvements in NPC patients. The full significance of these findings will be determined as part of the final analysis of these clinical trials.
On May 17, 2010, the FDA designated Trappsol® Cyclo™ as an orphan drug for the treatment of NPC, which would provide us with the exclusive right to sell Trappsol® Cyclo™ for the treatment of NPC for seven years following FDA drug approval. In April 2015, we also obtained Orphan Drug Designation for Trappsol® Cyclo™ in Europe, which will provide us with 10 years of market exclusivity following regulatory approval, which period will be extended to 12 years upon acceptance by the EMA’s Pediatric Committee of our pediatric investigation plan (PIP) demonstrating that Trappsol® Cyclo™ addresses the pediatric population. On January 12, 2017, we received Fast Track Designation from the FDA, and on December 1, 2017, the FDA designated NPC a Rare Pediatric Disease.
We are also exploring the use of cyclodextrins in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. In January 2018, the FDA authorized a single patient IND expanded access program using Trappsol® Cyclo™ for the treatment of this disease. After 18 months of treatment in this geriatric patient with late-onset disease, the disease was stabilized and the drug was well tolerated. The patient also exhibited signs of improvement with less volatility and shorter latency in word-finding. In October 2019, we entered into an agreement with Worldwide Clinical Trials, a Contract Research Organization, to conduct a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Trappsol® Cyclo™ for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. We prepared a synopsis for an early stage protocol using Trappsol® Cyclo™ intravenously to treat Alzheimer’s Disease, and we plan to present this synopsis to the FDA in early 2021.
We filed an International patent application in October 2019 under the Patent Cooperation Treaty directed to the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease with cyclodextrins, and we expect to pursue one or more national or regional stage applications based on this International application. The terms of any patents resulting from these national or regional stage applications would be expected to provide us with patent protection until 2039.
We also continue to operate our legacy fine chemical business, consisting of the sale of cyclodextrins and related products to the pharmaceutical, nutritional, and other industries, primarily for use in diagnostics and specialty drugs. However, our core business has transitioned to a biotechnology company primarily focused on the development of cyclodextrin-based biopharmaceuticals for the treatment of disease from a business that had been primarily reselling basic cyclodextrin products.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Ended December 31, 2019
For 2020, we incurred a net loss of approximately $8,942,000, compared to a net loss in 2019 of approximately $7,532,500. Total revenues for 2020 were $903,000 compared to $1,007,000 for 2019.
Our change in the mix of our product sales for 2020 and 2019 is as follows:
Trappsol® Cyclo™ HPBCDs
First and second-generation formulations of Trappsol® Cyclo™ HPBCD (in liquid and powder form) have been sold to a single customer who exports to Brazil for compassionate use in NPC patients. Sales decreased 71% to approximately $30,000 for 2020 from approximately $104,000 for 2019. The population of patients who use the product on a compassionate basis is small.
Trappsol® HPB
Our sales of Trappsol® HPB increased 10% to approximately $527,000 for 2020 from approximately $481,000 for 2019.
Trappsol® other products
Our sales of other Trappsol® products increased 24% to approximately $330,000 for 2020 from approximately $266,000 for 2019.
Aquaplex®
Our sales of Aquaplex® decreased to approximately $7,000 for 2020 compared to approximately $150,000 for 2019, and are primarily attributable to a single customer. The decrease in sales is representative of the periodic purchasing pattern of our primary Aquaplex® customer. Aquaplex® sales to this customer for the last five years were approximately $7,000 in 2020 $150,000 in 2019, $111,000 in 2018, $17,000 in 2017, and $134,000 in 2016.
The largest customers of our legacy fine chemical business continue to follow historical product ordering trends to place periodic large orders that represent a significant share of our annual revenue volume. In 2020, our five largest customers (Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., Thermofisher Scientific Diagnostics, Inc., Uno Healthcare and Siemens) accounted for 81% of our revenues, and the largest accounted for 34% of our revenues. In 2019, our five largest customers (Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., Sigma-Aldrich Fine Chemicals, Inc., Uno Healthcare, and Thermofisher Scientific Diagnostics, Inc.) accounted for 78% of our revenues, and the largest accounted for 25% of our revenues. Historically, our usual smaller sales of HPB occur more frequently throughout the year compared to our large sales that we receive periodically. The timing of when we receive and are able to complete these two kinds of sales has a significant effect on our quarterly revenues and operating results and makes period to period comparisons difficult.
Our cost of products sold decreased to approximately $66,000 for 2020 compared to approximately $75,500 for 2019. Our cost of products sold as a percentage of product sales was 7.0% for 2020 and 2019. This percentage is a function of the sales make up by product mix as well as customer order size. Historically, the timing and product mix of sales to our large customers has had a significant effect on our sales, cost of products sold and the related margin. We did not experience any significant increases in material costs during 2020 or 2019.
Our gross margins may not be comparable to those of other entities, since some entities include all the costs related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold. Our cost of goods sold includes only the direct cost of products sold and does not include any allocation of inbound or outbound freight charges, indirect overhead expenses, warehouse and distribution expenses, or depreciation and amortization expense. Our employees provide management, receiving, inspection, warehousing and shipping operations for us. The cost of our employees is included in personnel expense. Our other costs of warehousing and shipping functions are included in office and other expense.
As we buy inventory from foreign suppliers, the change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Euro, Yen and Yuan has an effect on our cost of inventory. Our main supplier of specialty cyclodextrins and complexes, Cyclodextrin Research & Development Laboratory, is located in Hungary and its prices are set in Euros. The cost of our bulk inventory often changes due to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar. The cost of shipping from outside the U.S. also has a significant effect on our inventory acquisition costs. When we experience short-term increases in currency fluctuation or supplier price increases, we are often not able to raise our prices sufficiently to maintain our historical margins. Therefore, our margins on these sales may decline.
Personnel expenses increased 34% to approximately $2,562,000 for 2020, from approximately $1,906,000 for 2019. In June 2019 we hired a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) on a part-time basis, and in September 2019 we hired a Global Head of Regulatory Affairs and Senior Vice President of Business Development. Increased personnel expenses reflect compensation expense and stock awards. In December 2020 the CFO went from part-time to full-time.
Research and development expenses increased 25% to approximately $6,096,000 for 2020, from approximately $4,869,000 for 2019. The increase in research and development expenses is due to increased activity in our International Clinical Program and U.S. clinical trials. We expect research and development costs to further increase in 2021 as we continue to seek regulatory approval for the use of Trappsol® Cyclo™ in the treatment of NPC and Alzheimer’s disease.
Repairs and maintenance expenses decreased 13% to approximately $7,000 for 2020 from approximately $8,000 for 2019. This decrease is due to varying levels of maintenance required on equipment and rental facilities. We expect our repairs and maintenance expenses to remain consistent in 2021.
Professional fees decreased 6% to approximately $537,000 for 2020 from approximately $572,000 for 2019. Professional fees may increase in the future due to new initiatives in raising capital and the continuation of product development.
Office and other expenses decreased 40% to approximately $507,000 for 2020 from approximately $846,000 for 2019. Office and other expenses include costs for travel to, and participation in, industry conferences and similar events, which were limited in 2020 due to COVID-19, and investor relations expenses.
Board of Directors fees and costs decreased to approximately $70,000 for 2020 from approximately $109,000 for 2019. Board of Directors fees and costs include fees paid to our non-employee directors and scientific advisory board members, reimbursement of expenses of our board members, and related expenses.
Amortization and depreciation increased to approximately $13,000 for 2020 from approximately $6,000 for 2019. These expenses fluctuate slightly with equipment purchases and dispositions.
Freight and shipping expenses were approximately $5,000 for 2020 compared to approximately $6,000 for 2019. Freight and shipping is dependent on frequency of ordering products for inventory and frequency of shipping out products sold.
We recorded an impairment expense for slow moving and expired inventory of approximately $154,000 for 2019. We did not incur this expense in 2020.
We increased our valuation allowance to allow for 100% of the 2020 increase in our deferred tax asset and did not recognize an income tax benefit or provision for 2020 and 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our cash increased to approximately $12,846,000 as of December 31, 2020, compared to approximately $2,784,000 as of December 31, 2019, primarily as the result of the public and private sales of our securities, including the public offering we closed in December 2020 described below. Our current assets less current liabilities were approximately $10,378,000 as of December 31, 2020, compared to approximately $817,000 at December 31, 2019. Cash used in operations was approximately $8,540,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to approximately $6,589,000 for 2019. The increase in cash used in operations is due primarily to our net loss and increasing expenses for our drug development and expansion strategy, which we intend to continue funding with the capital we raise.
On May 31, 2019, we completed a private placement of our securities to a group of accredited investors that included several directors of the Company and members of management. Investors in the private placement purchased a total of 297,700 units at a price per unit of $25.00, each unit consisting of one share of Common Stock and one warrant to purchase a share of Common Stock, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $7,442,500, before deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses.
In April 2020, we completed a private placement in which we raised $2,000,000 from the sale of 200,000 shares of Common Stock, at a price $10.00 per share, and in August 2020, we completed a private placement in which we raised an additional approximately $2,831,000 from the sale of 283,111 units at a price of $10.00 per unit, each unit consisting of one share of Common Stock and a seven-year warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $15.00 per share.
We also borrowed approximately $158,000 under the Paycheck Protection Program in May 2020, and plan to use the loan proceeds for qualifying expenses and to apply for forgiveness of the loan in accordance with the terms of the CARES Act. While we currently believe our use of the loan proceeds met or will meet the conditions for forgiveness of the loan, there can be no assurance in that regard.
On December 11, 2020 we sold an aggregate of 2,500,000 units at a price to the public of $5.00 per unit (the “Public Offering”), each unit consisting of one share of our Common Stock, and a warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $5.00 per share (the “Warrants”), pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement we entered into with Maxim Group LLC (“Maxim”). In addition, pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, we granted Maxim a 45-day option to purchase up to 375,000 additional shares of Common Stock, and/or 375,000 additional Warrants, to cover over-allotments in connection with the Offering, which Maxim partially exercised to purchase 375,000 Warrants on the closing date.
We received gross proceeds of $12,503,750 upon the initial closing of the Public Offering, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of eight percent (8%), and expenses. On December 22, 2020, we sold an additional 375,000 shares of Common Stock to Maxim upon its exercise of the balance of its over-allotment option, and received additional gross proceeds of $1,871,250 from such sale, bringing the total gross proceeds of the Public Offering to $14,375,000. The total expenses of the Public Offering were approximately $1,703,000 which included Maxim’s expenses relating to the offering.
Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, we issued warrants (the “Underwriter’s Warrants”) to Maxim to purchase up to a total of 57,500 shares of Common Stock (2% of the shares of Common Stock sold in the Public Offering). The Underwriter’s Warrants are exercisable at $6.25 per share of Common Stock and have a term of five years.
Subsequent to the closing of our December 2020 Public Offering through March 10, 2021, Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,654,184 shares of Common Stock were exercised resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $8,271,000.
The Company has continued to realize losses from operations. However, as a result of our Public Offering, we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our anticipated operating costs and capital expenditure requirements through March 2022. We will need to raise additional capital in the future to support our ongoing operations and continue our clinical trials. We expect to continue to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities from time to time for the foreseeable future to fund the development of our drug product candidates through clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization. Our ability to obtain such additional capital will likely be subject to various factors, including our overall business performance and market conditions. There can be no guarantee that the Company will be successful in its ability to raise capital to fund future operational and development initiatives.
At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $25,168,000 in net state and federal operating loss carryforwards expiring from 2021 through 2037, including $17,000,000 that will not expire, that can be used to offset our current and future taxable net income and reduce our income tax liabilities. We have provided a 100% valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset based on our expected future expenses related to our clinical trials and other development initiatives.
We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The results of operations are based on the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to select accounting policies for critical accounting areas as well as make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. The Company’s accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our year ended December 31, 2020. Significant changes in assumptions and/or conditions in our critical accounting policies could materially impact the operating results. We have identified the following accounting policies and related judgments as critical to understanding the results of our operations.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues are recognized when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We recognize revenues following the five step model prescribed under ASU No. 2014-09: (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation.
Product Revenues
In the U.S. we sell our products to the end user or wholesale distributors. In other countries, we sell our products primarily to wholesale distributors and other third-party distribution partners. These customers subsequently resell our products to health care providers and patients.
Revenues from product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon delivery to the customer. We expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that we would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial. We treat shipping and handling costs performed after a customer obtains control of the product as a fulfillment cost. We have identified one performance obligation in our contracts with customers which is the delivery of product to our customers. The transaction price is recognized in full when we deliver the product to our customer, which is the point at which we have satisfied our performance obligation.
Reserves for Discounts and Allowances
Revenues from product sales are recorded net of reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances that are offered within contracts with our customers, health care providers or payors, including those associated with the implementation of pricing actions in certain of the international markets in which we operate. Our process for estimating reserves established for these variable consideration components do not differ materially from our historical practices.
Product revenue reserves, which are classified as a reduction in product revenues, are generally characterized in the following categories: discounts, contractual adjustments and returns. These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to our customer) or a liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than our customer). Our estimates of reserves established for variable consideration typically utilize the most likely method and reflect our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. The transaction price, which includes variable consideration reflecting the impact of discounts and allowances, may be subject to constraint and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the amount of the cumulative revenues recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts may ultimately differ from our estimates. If actual results vary, we adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment.
Valuation Allowance on Deferred Tax Assets
At December 31, 2020, we fully reserved for our net deferred tax asset with an approximately $12,182,000 valuation allowance. We increased our valuation allowance by approximately $3,302,000 in 2020 to reduce our recognized deferred tax asset to zero.
We have determined it is more likely than not that we will not realize our temporary deductible differences and net operating loss carryforwards, and we have provided a 100% valuation allowance at December 31, 2020.
Current accounting standards require that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by the extent to which we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent cumulative earnings (loss) experience, expectations of future expenses from research and development and product development, expectations of future taxable income, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. The range of possible judgments relating to the valuation of our deferred tax asset is very wide. Significant judgment is required in making this assessment, and it is very difficult to predict when, if ever, our assessment may conclude our deferred tax assets are realizable.
Research and Development
The Company’s research and development activities and expenses are related to our International Clinical Trial Program. We expense our research and development costs as incurred.
