RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Summary
ChoiceOne's net income for 2020 was $15,613,000, compared to $7,171,000 in 2019. Excluding $2,714,000 in merger-related expenses, after tax, net income for 2020 amounted to $18,327,000. In this report, the term merger-related expenses includes expenses related to the merger with County and the merger with Community Shores.
Total assets have grown to $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2020 compared to $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase was related to the merger with Community Shores, as well as organic growth and funds obtained from various government stimulus programs. Gross loans grew $267.6 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. This loan growth coupled with a larger securities portfolio helped total interest income for 2020 to grow $23.2 million compared to the prior year. $174 million of the loan growth was attributed to the merger with Community Shores with other growth coming from Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") loans. 2020 interest income on loans included $721,000 of accretion of the discount recorded on the loans acquired in the mergers and PPP fee income of $3.0 million. ChoiceOne also saw deposit growth during 2020 of $520.0 million. ChoiceOne experienced $292.1 million of organic growth partly due to how individuals and businesses have managed funds received under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security ("CARES") Act, while the remainder was attributed to the merger with Community Shores. Despite the large increase in deposit balances, interest cost of deposits and other funding decreased by $56,000 in 2020 compared to 2019.
Total noninterest income increased $13.5 million in 2020 compared to the prior year. Mortgage servicing rights and gains on sales of loans increased due to lower interest rates encouraging refinance activity and a favorable housing market in ChoiceOne’s market areas. Customer service charges increased largely due to the impact of the mergers with Community Shores and County. ChoiceOne also restructured the securities portfolio during the year which led to higher net gains on sales of securities of $1.3 million in 2020 compared to $22,000 in 2019.
Total noninterest expense increased $22.4 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Much of the increase was caused by the mergers with Community Shores and County. The increase in salaries and benefits expense was related to annual wage increases and the additions to the number of the Company's employees caused by the mergers. The growth in data processing expense in 2020 compared to 2019 resulted from the mergers noted above and one-time expenses related to the mergers and the consolidation of the banks. Other noninterest expenses were also higher in the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same periods in the prior year due to growth in the related costs and the mergers noted above.
Net income for 2019 was $7,171,000, which represented a decline of $162,000 or 2% from 2018. Total assets grew to $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2019 compared to $671 million as of December 31, 2018; the increase was primarily related to the merger with County. Net loans grew $394 million from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. This loan growth coupled with a larger securities portfolio helped total interest income for 2019 to grow $7,948,000 compared to 2018. Substantially all loan growth was attributed to the merger with County. ChoiceOne also saw deposit growth during 2019 of $578 million. ChoiceOne experienced $33 million of growth in local deposits which was offset by a reduction of $32 million of brokered deposits, while the remainder was attributed to the merger with County. The interest cost of deposits and other funding increased by $2,239,000 in 2019 compared to 2018. Total noninterest income increased $2,248,000 in 2019 compared to 2018. Total noninterest expense increased $8,015,000 in 2019 compared to 2018. Much of the increase in expense was caused by merger-related expenses and Lakestone's expenses included in the fourth quarter of 2019.
The Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak
The coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Since first being reported in China, the coronavirus has spread globally, including in the United States. The coronavirus has had a substantial impact on numerous aspects of life in the United States, including threats to public health, increased volatility in markets, and severe effects on national and local economies.
COVID-19 has already had numerous effects on ChoiceOne. To protect the health of customers, employees, and others in its communities, ChoiceOne closed the lobbies of its branches from late March 2020 to mid-June 2020. During the period that lobbies were closed, ChoiceOne continued to provide its full scope of services to its customers through drive-up branch service, in-person meetings by appointment, and mobile banking.
COVID-19 has also affected ChoiceOne's customers. Although there were no material increases in delinquencies or net charge-offs during 2020, ChoiceOne increased its provision for loan losses by $4.0 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 in anticipation of an expected increase in levels of delinquencies and loan losses related to the impact of COVID-19. Consistent with federal banking agencies' revised “Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus,” ChoiceOne is working with its borrowers affected by COVID-19 and has granted approximately 750 payment deferrals on numerous loans to borrowers affected by the pandemic. Following the initial 90 day deferment period, ChoiceOne offered a second round of deferment in accordance with the CARES Act; however, significantly fewer customers requested further deferment. Less than 40 deferments remained active with loan balances totaling just $3.2 million at December 31, 2020 with all other previous deferments resuming their payments in accordance with loan terms. ChoiceOne will continue to attempt to assist borrowers using various means in appropriate circumstances, as needed.
In addition, ChoiceOne processed over $126 million in PPP loans through December 31, 2020 and acquired an additional $37 million in PPP loans in the merger with Community Shores. PPP loans are forgivable, in whole or in part, if the proceeds are used for payroll and other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements of the PPP. PPP loans carry a fixed rate of 1.00% and a term of two years (loans made before June 5, 2020) or five years (loans made on or after June 5, 2020), if not forgiven in whole or in part. Payments are deferred until either the date on which the Small Business Administration ("SBA") remits the amount of forgiveness proceeds to the lender or the date that is ten months after the last day of the covered period if the borrower does not apply for forgiveness within that ten-month period. The loans are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. The SBA pays the originating bank a processing fee based on the size of the loan. The initial PPP expired on August 8, 2020. On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, was signed into law, providing additional funding for the PPP. This round of the PPP opened on February 24, 2021 and, absent extension, will expire on March 31, 2021 (or such earlier date as funds are exhausted). Gross fees associated with PPP loans originated through December 31, 2020 totaled $5.0 million. Costs associated with these loans were approximately $199,000 and the net of $4.8 million is being recognized over the term of the loans. Upon the SBA forgiveness, unrecognized fees are then recognized into interest income. Fee income, which was included in interest income, recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020 was $3.0 million. $23.4 million in PPP loans were forgiven during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Dividends
Cash dividends of $6,174,000 or $0.82 per common share were declared in 2020, compared to $5,806,000 or $1.40 per common share in 2019 and $2,572,000 or $0.71 per common share in 2018. Dividends in 2019 included a special dividend of $0.60 per share paid on September 30, 2019 in connection with the merger with County. The dividend yield on ChoiceOne’s common stock was 2.66% as of the end of 2020, compared to 4.38% in 2019, and 2.84% in 2018. The cash dividend payout as a percentage of net income was 40% in 2020, compared to 81% in 2019 and 35% in 2018.
Table 1 - Average Balances and Tax-Equivalent Interest Rates
(1)
Interest on nontaxable securities and loans has been adjusted to a fully tax-equivalent basis to facilitate comparison to the taxable interest-earning assets. The adjustment uses an incremental tax rate of 21%.
(2)
Interest on loans included net origination fees charged on loans of approximately $5,236,000, $866,000, and $1,087,000 in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
(3)
Interest on taxable securities includes dividends on Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank stock.
(4)
Noninterest-earning assets include loans in nonaccrual status, which averaged approximately $4,480,000, $2,965,000, and $1,266,000 in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
Table 2 - Changes in Tax-Equivalent Net Interest Income
(1)
The volume variance is computed as the change in volume (average balance) multiplied by the previous year’s interest rate. The rate variance is computed as the change in interest rate multiplied by the previous year’s volume (average balance). The change in interest due to both volume and rate has been allocated to the volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each.
(2)
Interest on tax-exempt securities and loans has been adjusted to a fully tax-equivalent basis using an incremental tax rate of 21% for 2020, 2019, and 2018.
Net Interest Income
The presentation of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), but is customary in the banking industry. This non-GAAP measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt loans and investment securities. The adjustments to determine net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis were $737,000, $408,000, and $398,000 for the years ended 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These adjustments were computed using a 21% federal income tax rate.
On March 3, 2020 the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee lowered the federal funds rate by 50 basis points which was followed by a reduction of 100 basis points on March 15, 2020. Operating in an environment with lower interest rates has had a negative effect on both ChoiceOne’s interest income and interest spread. ChoiceOne management continues to monitor rates and their effect on income as part of the Asset/Liability Risk Committee to determine what strategic decisions will need to be made in both higher and lower rate environments.
Tax-equivalent net interest income increased $23.6 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was attributed to an increase of $715.0 million in average interest-earning assets. The average balance of loans increased $480.3 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Much of the increase was due to loans acquired from the merger with Community Shores, which were included in the last six months of 2020, and the merger with County, which were included in all of 2020 compared to only the fourth quarter of 2019. The remaining growth was loans from the PPP. The average balance growth was offset by the decline in the average rate earned on loans of 39 basis points in 2020 compared to 2019 as a result of PPP loans interest rates of 1%. Tax-equivalent interest income on loans increased $20.1 million in 2020 compared to the prior year. The average balance of total securities grew $178.3 million in 2020 compared to the prior year. The inclusion of securities acquired in the mergers with Community Shores and County made up a portion of this increase but most of the increase was due to purchases during the year. The average balance growth offset by a 33 basis point decline in the average rate earned on securities caused interest income from securities to grow $3.5 million in 2020 compared to the prior year. An average balance in other interest-earning assets of $71.4 million in 2020, as compared to the balance of $15.0 million in 2019, offset by a decline of 142 basis points in the rate earned caused interest income to remain neutral.
Despite large increases in deposit balances due to the mergers and organic deposit growth, a significant decline in overall market interest rates in 2020 compared to 2019 caused the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities to decline by $56,000. The average balance of interest-bearing demand deposits and savings deposits increased $451.4 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The effect of this increase, offset by a 17 basis point decline in the average rate paid, caused interest expense to be $494,000 higher in 2020 than in the prior year. The average balance of certificates of deposit was $47.3 million higher in 2020 than in 2019. Growth in the average balance was more than offset by a decline in average rate paid of 76 basis points which caused interest expense to decline by $504,000. Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank and other interest bearing liabilities caused a decline of $46,000 in interest paid in 2020 compared to 2019.
ChoiceOne’s tax-equivalent net interest income spread was 3.38% in 2020 and 3.47% in 2019. The decrease in the net interest income spread resulted from a lower rate earned on interest-earning assets, largely due to PPP loans and a decline in the federal funds rate.
Tax-equivalent net interest income increased $5.7 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was attributed to an increase of $177.7 million in average interest-earning assets, partially offset by the impact of a decline of 21 basis points in ChoiceOne’s net interest spread. The reduction in the net interest spread resulted from an increase of 26 basis points in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, while the average rate earned on interest-earning assets increased 5 basis points.
The average balance of loans increased $130.2 million in 2019 compared to 2018, $105.8 million of which was due to loans acquired in the County merger which were included in the fourth quarter of 2019. The remaining growth was primarily from residential real estate loans, whose average balance increased $22.6 million in 2019 compared to 2018. In addition to the average balance growth, the average rate earned on loans increased 6 basis points in 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of higher general market interest rates and higher rates charged on new loan originations. Tax-equivalent interest income on loans increased $6.8 million in 2019 compared to the prior year. The average balance of total securities grew $40.0 million in 2019 compared to the prior year. The inclusion of securities acquired in the County merger in the fourth quarter of 2019 caused an average balance increase of $45.0 million, while the average balance of securities excluding those acquired securities was $5.0 million lower in 2019 than in 2018. The average balance growth and a minimal change in the average rate earned on securities caused interest income from securities to grow $1.1 million in 2019 compared to the prior year. An average balance in other interest-earning assets of $15.0 million in 2019, as compared to the balance of $7.5 million in 2018, caused interest income to increase $137,000.
Overall higher general market interest rates in 2019 compared to 2018 caused the average rate paid to be higher for all interest-bearing liability categories. The average balance of interest-bearing demand deposits increased $68.9 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The effect of this increase and a 23 basis point increase in the average rate paid caused interest expense to be $871,000 higher in 2019 than in the prior year. The average balance of certificates of deposit was $26.7 million higher in 2019 than in 2018. Growth in the average balance plus the impact of a 53 basis point increase in the average rate paid caused interest expense to grow $1.0 million. A $7.0 million increase in the average balance of Federal Home Loan Bank advances coupled with a 44 basis point increase in the average rate paid caused interest expense to grow $220,000 in 2019 compared to the prior year.
ChoiceOne’s tax-equivalent net interest income spread was 3.47% in 2019 and 3.68% in 2018. The decrease in the net interest income spread resulted from a lower level of growth in the average rate earned on interest-earning assets than the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
Provision and Allowance For Loan Losses
Table 3 - Provision and Allowance For Loan Losses
The provision for loan losses was $4.0 million in 2020 compared to $0 in 2019. The provision for 2020 was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, discussed above. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased to 0.71% of loans as of December 31, 2020, compared to 0.51% as of the end of 2019 and 1.14% as of the end of 2018. The change was due to the acquisition of $174 million of loans from the merger with Community Shores in 2020 and the acquisition of $424 million of loans from the merger with County in 2019. A fair value adjustment of $9.0 million related to these loans existed as of the end of 2020 and a fair value adjustment of $4.7 million related to these loans existed as of the end of 2019. This fair value adjustment is not considered an allowance for loan losses but was recorded upon the acquisition of the loans from Community Shores and County. The provision in 2020 was deemed prudent due to growth in ChoiceOne’s loan portfolio and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ChoiceOne's local market areas and the national economy. Nonperforming loans were $8.2 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $6.4 million as of December 31, 2019. The coverage ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was 92% as of December 31, 2020, compared to 63% and 123% as of the end of 2019 and 2018, respectively. If the credit mark associated with the loans acquired in the mergers were added to the allowance for loan losses, the total would have represented 1.60% of total loans at December 31, 2020.
Net charge-offs were $464,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net charge-offs of $616,000 and a net recovery of $61,000 during 2019 and 2018 respectively. Management is aware that the economic climate in Michigan will continue to affect business and individual borrowers. Management believes that COVID-19 will also have a significant impact in 2021. Management has worked and intends to continue to work with delinquent borrowers in an attempt to lessen the negative impact of COVID-19 on ChoiceOne. ChoiceOne offered an initial 90 day deferment beginning in March 2020 to both commercial and retail borrowers where the borrower could defer either the principal portion of their payment or both the principal and interest portions. Management processed approximately 750 payment deferrals with loan balances totaling $148 million for commercial and retail borrowers through December 31, 2020. Following the initial 90 day deferment period, ChoiceOne offered a second round of deferments in accordance with the CARES Act; however, significantly fewer customers requested further deferment. Less than 40 deferments remained active with loan balances totaling just $3.2 million at December 31, 2020 with all other previous deferments resuming their payment in accordance with loan terms. ChoiceOne will continue to attempt to assist borrowers using various means in appropriate circumstances, as needed. ChoiceOne has allocated approximately $2.2 million in the allowance for loan losses to borrowers falling into industry classification codes that management believes to be highly or moderately affected by the pandemic and from which a higher concentration of deferral requests have been received during the past nine months. ChoiceOne understands that a deferral request does not automatically mean a borrower is at a risk of loss, but assumes this to be a possible indicator.
The following chart indicates industries management believes to be moderately or highly affected by the pandemic:
All loans which have requested a second deferment have an additional 500 basis points of allowance allocated to them. Loans highly affected and moderately affected based on their commercial industry category have allocated to them an additional 35 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively. ChoiceOne has also allocated 25 basis points to all retail loan categories. It is noted that this allowance amount is in addition to the regularly calculated allowance based on risk rating and qualitative factors. ChoiceOne will continue to monitor concentrations as part of its analysis on an ongoing basis. As charge-offs, changes in the level of nonperforming loans, and changes within the composition of the loan portfolio occur in the future and the impact of COVID-19 continues to become more apparent, the provision and allowance for loan losses will be reviewed by ChoiceOne's management and adjusted as determined to be necessary.
ChoiceOne had $431,000 of specific allowance allocations for problem loans as of the end of 2020, compared to $355,000 as of the prior year end. Special allowance amounts have been allocated where the fair values of loans were considered to be less than their carrying values. ChoiceOne obtains valuations on collateral dependent loans when the loan is considered by management to be impaired and uses the valuation amounts in the determination of fair value. Management believes the specific reserves allocated to certain problem loans at the end of 2020 and 2019 were reasonable based on the circumstances surrounding each particular borrower.
The following schedule presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses to the various loan categories as of the years ended December 31:
Loans acquired from the mergers with Community Shores and County were considered for the allowance for loan losses but, with the exception of an immaterial number of loans which were moved to an impaired status during the year, no allowance allocation was deemed necessary as management concluded there was no deterioration in credit subsequent to the effective date of the respective merger, and the recorded fair value adjustments were adequate based on management’s assessment of losses incurred. The increase in the allowance allocation in 2020 was primarily related to the COVID-19 pandemic discussed above with other increases due to scale increase due to the mergers with Community Shores and County.
Management maintains the allowance at a level that it believes adequately provides for losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Such losses are estimated by a variety of factors, including specific examination of certain borrowing relationships and consideration of historical losses incurred on certain types of credits. Current economic conditions and collateral values affect loss estimates. Management focuses on early identification of problem credits through ongoing reviews by management and the independent loan review function. Based on the current state of the economy and a recent review of the loan portfolio, management believes that the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2020 was adequate. As charge-offs, changes in the level of nonperforming loans, and changes within the composition of the loan portfolio occur, the provision and allowance for loan losses will be reviewed by the Bank’s management and adjusted as necessary.
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income increased $13.5 million in 2020 compared to 2019, a portion of which was due to the merger with Community Shores and the associated noninterest income included in the second half of 2020, and the merger with County and the associated noninterest income included in all of 2020 compared to only the fourth quarter of 2019. Customer service charges increased $2.0 million in 2020 compared to the prior year due to higher overdraft fees, checking account service charges, and net debit card fees. Growth in mortgage servicing rights income of $2.4 million and gains on sales of loans of $7.0 million in 2020 compared to the prior year resulted from low interest rates for residential real estate loans that increased the level of residential mortgage originations and refinancing originations. The increase in net gains on sales of securities in 2020 compared to 2019 was caused by a restructuring of ChoiceOne's securities portfolio in the second quarter of 2020 to take advantage of the low market interest rates. Earnings on life insurance policies would have been larger in 2020 compared to 2019 if not for a $288,000 death claim recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019. The negative change in the market value of equity securities in 2020 compared to no change in the same period in the prior year was due primarily to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on equity market values in 2020.
Total noninterest income increased $2.2 million in 2019 compared to 2018, a large portion of which was due to the merger with County, for which noninterest income was included in the fourth quarter of 2019. Customer service charges increased $752,000 in 2019 compared to the prior year due to higher overdraft fees, checking account service charges, and net debit card fees. Gains on sales of loans grew $948,000 in 2019 compared to the prior year as relatively low interest rates for residential real estate loans increased the level of residential mortgage originations. Earnings on life insurance policies included $288,000 from a death claim recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019. The growth in other noninterest income was primarily due to trust income and other income from the merger with County in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Noninterest Expense
Total noninterest expense increased $22.4 million in 2020 compared to 2019, a large portion of which was due to the merger with Community Shores and the associated noninterest expense included in the second half of 2020, and the merger with County and the associated noninterest income included in all of 2020 compared to only the fourth quarter of 2019. Salaries and benefits expense grew $12.1 million in 2020 compared to the prior year. The majority of the increase is related to the increased scale following the mergers with Community Shores and County; however, a portion was also due to merger-related costs. Commission, bonus expenses and health insurance expenses were higher in 2020 than the prior year. Occupancy and equipment expense grew $2.2 million in 2020 compared to 2019, with the increase caused by the mergers previously noted. An increase of $3.6 million in data processing expenses resulted from the mergers previously noted. The growth of $604,000 in professional fees in 2020 compared to the prior year was principally due to costs related to the merger with Community Shores. Intangible amortization expense also increased $1.1 million during 2020 compared to 2019 related to the timing of the mergers previously noted.
Total noninterest expense increased $8,015,000 in 2019 compared to 2018, a large portion of which was due to County’s noninterest expense included in the fourth quarter of 2019. Salaries and benefits expense grew $3,404,000 in 2019 compared to the prior year. The majority of the increase was due to Lakestone’s expenses in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a portion was also due to merger-related costs. Commission and bonus expenses were higher in 2019 than 2018 while health insurance costs were lower. Occupancy and equipment expense grew $835,000 in 2019 compared to 2018, with the increase caused by Lakestone’s expenses and costs related to the two offices opened by ChoiceOne in 2018. An increase of $1,005,000 in data processing expenses resulted from Lakestone’s expenses and higher debit card processing costs. The growth of $1,763,000 in professional fees in 2019 compared to the prior year was principally due to costs related to the merger with County. Advertising and promotional expense was $220,000 higher in 2019 than 2018 due to Lakestone expenses and costs related to a checking account promotion campaign in 2019. FDIC insurance expense declined in 2019 compared to the prior year as an insurance credit was created when the FDIC insurance fund reached 1.35% of total deposits. Growth of $576,000 in other noninterest expense in 2019 compared to 2018 was caused by Lakestone expenses and various changes in general expense accounts.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense was $2.0 million higher in 2020 than in 2019. The increase was due to certain merger-related expenses incurred in 2020 which were nondeductible and increases in income before income tax due to the mergers with Community Shores and County. Income tax expense was $139,000 more in 2019 than in 2018 due to certain merger-related expenses incurred in 2019 that were nondeductible. The effective tax rate was 17% in 2020, compared to 15% in 2019 and 14% in 2018.
Financial Condition
Summary
Total assets were $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2020, which represented an increase of $533.2 million from the end of 2019. $244.0 million of the increase resulted from the merger with Community Shores noted above. Cash and due from banks increased $20.0 million. The investment securities portfolio grew $235.2 million in 2020 compared to the balance at the end of 2019. Net loans grew $264.1 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. $174.0 million of this loan growth came from loans acquired through the merger with Community Shores while ChoiceOne also added $126.4 million in PPP loans during 2020. It is noted that $23.4 million of the PPP loans have been forgiven as of December 31, 2020. Total deposits increased $520.0 million in 2020 compared to 2019, of which $227.8 million were obtained from the merger with Community Shores.
Securities
The Company’s securities balances as of December 31 were as follows:
As noted above total investment securities increased $235.2 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. A total of $20.0 million was obtained from the merger with Community Shores. Approximately $375.7 million of securities were purchased in 2020. Securities totaling $28.8 million were called or matured in 2020. Principal payments for municipal and mortgage-backed securities totaling $20.0 million were received during 2020. Approximately $121.9 million of securities were sold during 2020 for net gains of $1.3 million. Securities totaling $177.7 million were sold as part of the restructuring of Lakestone’s portfolio in 2019. The Bank’s Investment Committee continues to monitor the portfolio and purchases securities as it considers prudent.
Equity securities included a money market preferred security (MMP) of $1.0 million and common stock of $1.9 million as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, equity securities included an MMP of $1.0 million and common stock of $1.9 million.
Loans
The Company’s loan portfolio as of December 31 was as follows:
As noted above the loan portfolio (excluding loans held for sale and loans to other financial institutions) increased $267.6 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. Growth in all categories was due to the merger with Community Shores, which attributed $174.0 million of the loan growth with other growth coming from PPP loans.
The Bank entered into an agreement during 2018 to provide a line of credit to facilitate funding of residential mortgage loan originations at other financial institutions. The loans are short-term in nature and are designed to provide funding for the time period between the loan origination and its subsequent sale in the secondary market. The balance of the lines of credit held by the Bank was $35.2 million as of December 31, 2020 compared to $51.0 million as of December 31, 2019.
Information regarding impaired loans can be found in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. In addition to its review of the loan portfolio for impaired loans, management also monitors various nonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans are comprised of (1) loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis; (2) loans, not included in nonaccrual loans, which are contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments; and (3) loans, not included in nonaccrual or past due 90 days or more, which are considered troubled debt restructurings. Troubled debt restructurings consist of loans where the terms have been modified to assist the borrowers in making their payments. The modifications can include capitalization of interest onto the principal balance, reduction in interest rate, and extension of the loan term.
The balances of these nonperforming loans as of December 31 were as follows:
Nonaccrual loans included $348,000 in agricultural loans, $1,802,000 in commercial and industrial loans, $8,000 in consumer loans, $3,088,000 in commercial real estate loans, $80,000 in construction real estate loans, and $1,381,000 in residential real estate loans as of December 31, 2020. Nonaccrual loans included $379,000 in agricultural loans, $776,000 in commercial and industrial loans, $16,000 in consumer loans, $2,185,000 in commercial real estate loans, and $1,331,000 in residential real estate loans as of December 31, 2019. The primary reason for the increase in nonaccrual loans in 2020 was loans acquired from the merger of Community Shores. Loans considered troubled debt restructurings which were not on a nonaccrual basis and were not 90 days or more past due as to principal or interest payments consisted of $196,000 in commercial real estate loans and $1,341,000 in residential real estate loans at December 31, 2020, compared to $391,000 in commercial and industrial loans, and $1,335,000 in residential real estate loans at December 31, 2019.
The federal banking agencies issued an “Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus” on March 22, 2020 and subsequently issued a revised statement on April 7, 2020. These statements encourage financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers affected by COVID-19, and provide that short-term modifications to loans made on a good faith basis to borrowers who were current as of the implementation date of the statements are not considered TDRs. Further, Section 4013 of the CARES Act states that COVID-19 related modifications on loans that were current as of December 31, 2019 are not TDRs. ChoiceOne offered an initial 90 day deferment beginning in March 2020 to both commercial and retail borrowers where the borrower could defer either the principal portion of their payments or both the principal and interest portions. Following the initial 90 day deferment period, ChoiceOne offered a second round of deferments in accordance with the CARES Act; however, significantly fewer customers requested further deferment. As of December 31, 2020, ChoiceOne had granted deferments on approximately 750 loans with loan balances totaling $148 million which, in reliance on the statements of federal banking agencies and the CARES Act, are not reflected as TDRs in this report.
Management also maintains a list of loans that are not classified as nonperforming loans but where some concern exists as to the borrowers’ abilities to comply with the original loan terms. These loans totaled $26.1 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $14.0 million as of December 31, 2019.
Deposits and Other Funding Sources
The Company’s deposit balances as of December 31 were as follows:
Total deposits increased $520.0 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, of which $227.8 million was obtained from the merger with Community Shores. Much of the remaining growth was due to the various stimulus programs offered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Total borrowings declined as other funding sources were replaced by local deposits growth. The Bank’s blanket collateral agreement covering agricultural real estate loans and residential real estate loans that secured Federal Home Loan Bank advances were pledged against the Bank’s outstanding advances at the end of 2020. Approximately $85.6 million of additional advances were available as of December 31, 2020 based on the collateral pledged by the Bank.
In 2021, management will continue to focus its marketing efforts toward growth in local deposits. If local deposit growth is insufficient to support asset growth, management believes that advances from the FHLB and brokered certificates of deposit can address corresponding funding needs.
Shareholders’ Equity
Total shareholders' equity increased $35.1 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. The merger with Community Shores caused $15.5 million of equity to be issued in consideration for Community Shores stock in addition to cash consideration. The remaining growth in equity resulted from the retention of earnings in 2020 as net income exceeded dividends paid by $9.4 million. Accumulated other comprehensive income increased by $9.6 million in 2020 principally as a result of available for sale securities held prior to the decrease in market interest rates to be in a larger unrealized gain position. Equity issuances also contributed $646,000 to equity during 2020.
Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements presents regulatory capital information for ChoiceOne and the Bank at the end of 2020 and 2019. Management will monitor these capital ratios during 2021 as they relate to asset growth and earnings retention. ChoiceOne’s Board of Directors and management do not plan to allow capital to decrease below those levels necessary to be considered "well capitalized" by regulatory guidelines. At December 31, 2020, the Bank was categorized as "well-capitalized" under the Basel III framework.
Table 4 - Contractual Obligations
The following table discloses information regarding the maturity of ChoiceOne’s contractual obligations at December 31, 2020:
Liquidity and Interest Rate Risk
Net cash from operating activities was $8.5 million in 2020 compared to $9.2 million in 2019. Net cash used in investing activities was $250.8 million in 2020 compared to cash provided of $36.4 million in 2019. The change was caused by higher net purchases of securities in 2020 compared to 2019 and higher growth in loans in 2020 outside of Community Shores loans added, partially offset by more cash received from the Community Shores merger than the County merger. Net cash flows from financing activities were a positive $262.2 million in 2020 compared to a negative $5.7 million in 2019. The change was caused by more growth in deposits in 2020 outside of Community Shores deposits, partially offset by a higher level of net paydowns in borrowings in 2020 compared to 2019.
ChoiceOne's primary market risk exposure occurs in the form of interest rate risk. Liquidity risk also can have an impact but to a lesser extent. ChoiceOne's business is transacted in U.S. dollars with no foreign exchange risk exposure. Agricultural loans comprise a relatively small portion of ChoiceOne's total assets. Management believes that ChoiceOne's exposure to changes in commodity prices is insignificant.
Management believes that the current level of liquidity is sufficient to meet the Bank's normal operating needs. This belief is based upon the availability of deposits from both the local and national markets, maturities of securities, normal loan repayments, income retention, federal funds purchased, lines of credit from correspondent banks, and advances available from the FHLB. Liquidity risk deals with ChoiceOne's ability to meet its cash flow requirements. These requirements include depositors desiring to withdraw funds and borrowers seeking credit. Relatively short-term liquid funds exist in the form of lines of credit to purchase federal funds at correspondent banks. As of December 31, 2020, the amount of federal funds available for purchase from the Bank's correspondent banks totaled approximately $104.5 million. ChoiceOne’s federal funds purchased balance was $0 as of December 31, 2020 and $4.8 million as of December 31, 2019. The Bank also has a line of credit secured by ChoiceOne’s commercial loans with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago for $148.9 million, which is designated for nonrecurring short-term liquidity needs. Longer-term liquidity needs may be met through local deposit growth, maturities of securities, normal loan repayments, advances from the FHLB, brokered certificates of deposit, and income retention. Approximately $85.6 million of borrowing capacity was available from the FHLB based on agricultural real estate loans and residential real estate loans pledged as collateral at the end of 2020. The acceptance of brokered certificates of deposit is not limited as long as the Bank is categorized as “well capitalized” under regulatory guidelines.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
This report contains references to net income excluding tax-effected merger-related expenses, which is a financial measure that is not defined in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides additional information that is useful to investors in helping to understand the underlying financial performance of ChoiceOne.
Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations. Readers should be aware of these limitations and should be cautious with respect to the use of such measures. To compensate for these limitations, we use non-GAAP measures as comparative tools, together with GAAP measures, to assist in the evaluation of our operating performance or financial condition. Also, we ensure that these measures are calculated using the appropriate GAAP or regulatory components in their entirety and that they are computed in a manner intended to facilitate consistent period-to-period comparisons. ChoiceOne’s method of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from methods used by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for those financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP or in-effect regulatory requirements.
NON-GAAP Reconciliation
(Unaudited)
The non-GAAP measures presented in the table below reflect the adjustments of the reported U.S. GAAP results for significant items that management does not believe are reflective of the Company's current and ongoing operations.
Critical Accounting Policies And Estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as well as disclosures found elsewhere in this report are based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near-term relate to the determination of the market value of securities, the amount of the allowance for loan losses, loan servicing rights, carrying value of goodwill, and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Securities
Debt securities available for sale may be sold prior to maturity due to changes in interest rates, prepayment risks, yield, availability of alternative investments, liquidity needs, credit rating changes, or other factors. Debt securities classified as available for sale are reported at their fair value with changes flowing through other comprehensive income. Declines in the fair value of securities below their cost that are considered to be “other than temporary” are recorded as losses in the income statement. In estimating whether a fair value decline is considered to be “other than temporary,” management considers the length of time and extent that the security’s fair value has been less than its carrying value, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the Bank’s ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
Market values for securities available for sale are obtained from outside sources and applied to individual securities within the portfolio. The difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of securities is recorded as a valuation adjustment and reported net of tax effect in other comprehensive income.
Effective January 1, 2018, equity securities are reported at their fair value with changes in market value flowing through net income. Prior to 2018, equity securities were accounted for in a manner similar to available for sale debt securities.
Allowance for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the consolidated loan portfolio. Management’s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is an estimate based on reviews of individual loans, assessments of the impact of current economic conditions on the portfolio and historical loss experience of seasoned loan portfolios.
Management believes the accounting estimate related to the allowance for loan losses is a “critical accounting estimate” because (1) the estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because of assumptions concerning the changes in the types and volumes of the portfolios and current economic conditions and (2) the impact of recognizing an impairment or loan loss could have a material effect on the Company’s assets reported on the balance sheet as well as its net income.
Loan Servicing Rights
Loan servicing rights represent the estimated value of servicing loans that are sold with servicing retained by ChoiceOne and are initially recorded at estimated fair value. Servicing rights are expensed in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing revenues. Management’s accounting treatment of loan servicing rights is estimated based on current prepayment speeds that are typically market driven.
Management believes the accounting estimate related to loan servicing rights is a “critical accounting estimate” because (1) the estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because of significant changes within long-term interest rates affecting the prepayment speeds for current loans being serviced and (2) the impact of recognizing an impairment loss could have a material effect on ChoiceOne’s net income. Management has obtained a third-party valuation of its loan servicing rights to corroborate its current carrying value at the end of each reporting period.
Goodwill
Generally accepted accounting principles require that the fair values of the assets and liabilities of an acquired entity be recorded at their fair value on the date of acquisition. The fair values are determined using both internal computations and information obtained from outside parties when deemed necessary. The net difference between the price paid for the acquired company and the net value of its balance sheet is recorded as goodwill. Accounting principles also require that goodwill be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Under recently issued accounting pronouncements, ChoiceOne is permitted to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of equity is less than its carrying value. If the conclusion is that it is more likely than not that the fair value of equity is more than its carrying value, no further testing in the form of a quantitative assessment is necessary. If the conclusion is that it is more likely than not that the fair value of equity is less than its carrying value, then a two-step quantitative assessment test is performed to identify any potential goodwill impairment.
Management hired a third party to perform a quantitative assessment of goodwill as of November 30, 2020. The third party used an income approach to calculate cash flow based on excess capital above a required tangible equity to tangible assets ratio selected with consideration given to regulatory guidelines and the risk profile of ChoiceOne. As a result of the income approach, no indication of goodwill impairment was noted. The third party analysis also assessed the share price, book value, and financial results of ChoiceOne as compared to the previous year. Additionally, industry and market conditions were evaluated and compared, including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the ability of ChoiceOne’s borrowers to comply with loan terms. The third party also compared average values for recently closed bank merger and acquisition transactions to ChoiceOne's recently completed merger and acquisition transactions. In assessing the totality of the events and circumstances, management determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Bank’s operations, from a qualitative perspective, exceeded the carrying value as of November 30, 2020 and there was no further quantitative assessment necessary.
Taxes
Income taxes include both a current and deferred portion. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded to account for differences in the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses for financial reporting and tax purposes. Generally accepted accounting principles require that deferred tax assets be reviewed to determine whether a valuation allowance should be established using a “more likely than not” standard. Based on its review of ChoiceOne’s deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020, management determined that no valuation allowance was necessary.
