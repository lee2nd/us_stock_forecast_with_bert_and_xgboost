ITEM 7. TRUSTEE’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
As discussed herein under Part II, Item 9A (Controls and Procedures), due to the pass-through nature of the Trust, Hilcorp is the primary source of the information disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other periodic reports filed by the Trust with the SEC. Although the Trustee receives periodic updates from Hilcorp regarding activities which may relate to the Trust, the Trust’s ability to timely report certain information required to be disclosed in the Trust’s periodic reports is dependent on Hilcorp’s timely delivery of the information to the Trust.
Overview
The principal asset of the Trust is the Royalty, which consists of a 75% net overriding royalty interest that burdens the Subject Interests located in the San Juan Basin. The primary function of the Trustee is to collect the Royalty Income, to pay all expenses and charges of the Trust and to distribute the remaining available income to the Unit Holders. The amount of income distributable to Unit Holders, which we refer to as “Distributable Income,” depends on the amount of Royalty Income and interest received by the Trust, as well as the amount of expenses paid by the Trust and any change in cash reserves.
Royalty Income. The Royalty functions generally as a net profits interest in the Subject Interests. The Royalty Income paid to the Trust is 75% of net proceeds from the Subject Interests. The term “net proceeds,” as used in the Conveyance, means the excess of gross proceeds received by Hilcorp during a particular period over production costs for such period. “Gross proceeds” means the amount received by Hilcorp (or any subsequent owner of the Subject Interests) from the sale of the production attributable to the Subject Interests, subject to certain adjustments.
The amount of gross proceeds attributable to the Subject Interests depends on prevailing natural gas prices and, to a lesser extent, crude oil prices. As a result, commodity prices affect the amount of Royalty Income available for distribution to the Unit Holders. During 2020, the price of natural gas for production from the Subject Interests decreased from an average price for natural gas of $1.79 per Mcf in 2019 to $1.51 per Mcf in 2020. The price for oil decreased from an average price of $45.11 per Bbl in 2019 to $31.47 per Bbl in 2020.
The amount of gross proceeds also depends on the volumes of natural gas and oil produced from the Subject Interests. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Trust cannot acquire new natural gas and oil assets, and as a result, Royalty Income is dependent on the natural gas and oil volumes attributable to the Subject Interests. Although Hilcorp and other operators of the Subject Interests may conduct drilling operations or well recompletions in the near term, the Subject Interests are depleting assets, and Hilcorp has informed the Trust that it is unable to estimate the productive life of the Subject Interests. Lower commodity prices may also reduce the volume of natural gas and oil produced from the Subject Interests by Hilcorp. Hilcorp did not conduct any new drill projects or recompletions within the Subject Interests in 2020.
On February 23, 2021, the Trust announced that Hilcorp had informed the Trust that its 2021 capital project plan for the Subject Interests (the “2021 Plan”) will allocate primarily all of its $0.3 million total towards facilities projects related to natural gas compression. Due to the current low prices for natural gas, Hilcorp informed the Trust that it does not plan to conduct any new drill projects or recompletions within the Subject Interests during 2021. However, Hilcorp advised the Trust that the 2021 Plan is subject to revision if Hilcorp changes its assumptions underlying the 2021 Plan, particularly changes in the prices of natural gas.
Under the terms of the Conveyance, production costs are deducted from gross proceeds in calculating Royalty Income. “Production costs” generally means costs incurred on an accrual basis by Hilcorp in operating the Subject Interests, including both capital and non-capital costs. For example, these costs include development drilling, production and processing costs, applicable taxes and operating charges. However, Hilcorp informed the Trust that, for wells operated by Hilcorp, it generally did not intend to accrue lease operating expenses to the Trust. If production costs exceed gross proceeds in any month, the excess is recovered out of future gross proceeds prior to the making of further payment to the Trust, but the Trust is not otherwise liable for any production costs or other costs or liabilities attributable to the Subject Interests or the minerals produced therefrom. If at any time the Trust receives more than the amount due under the Royalty, it is not obligated to return such overpayment, but the amounts payable to it for any subsequent period are reduced by such amount, plus interest, at a rate specified in the Conveyance. The Trust and the Trustee has very limited authority to control the amount and timing of production costs.
Distributable Income. In addition to Royalty Income, the Trust receives interest income, typically from interest paid on cash deposits. General and administrative expenses constitute the Trust’s primary expense and include, among other items, the Trustee’s fees, audit, consulting and legal fees and reporting costs.
The Trustee is authorized to determine in its discretion the amount of cash reserves needed to pay liabilities and contingencies of the Trust. Total cash reserves were $1.0 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. The Trust utilized cash reserves of $397,090 to pay Trust administrative expenses in 2020. The Trust replenished its cash reserves by $397,090 in October 2020 to bring the cash reserve balance back to the previously established amount of $1.0 million. The Trustee does not anticipate any increase or decrease to the cash reserves in 2021.
Covid-19 Pandemic. The Trust continues to request periodic updates from Hilcorp as to its production and financial expectations with respect to the Subject Interests due to any effects caused by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the recent fluctuations in oil and gas pricing. Hilcorp has informed the Trust that, given the current natural gas pricing environment, Hilcorp does not anticipate materially reducing any of the Subject Interests’ production or taking any of the Subject Interests’ wells offline; however, both the Trust and Hilcorp continue to monitor the impact that Covid-19 may have on production, including as it relates to personnel availability in New Mexico and other Subject Interest areas. Hilcorp further informed the Trust that it does not anticipate that Covid-19 will have any material impact on its operation of the Subject Interests or on its payments of Royalty Income to the Trust. However, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on Hilcorp and the Subject Interests is still unknown and any such impact could result in actual results being different from Hilcorp’s expectations.
Hilcorp
The sale of San Juan Basin assets, including the Subject Interests, from Burlington to Hilcorp closed on July 31, 2017. Hilcorp has advised the Trust that for certain months (since the closing of its purchase of the assets), it has reported estimates of cash revenues and expenses based on the best information available to it at the time, instead of reporting actual amounts. Hilcorp further has informed the Trust that it believes that its estimates have been prepared in accordance with the Conveyance, and the Trust and its advisors continue to review such estimates for compliance with the Conveyance.
Gross Proceeds and Severance Tax Estimates. Hilcorp’s process of reconciling actual revenue and severance taxes to previously reported estimates (which the Trust refers to as “true-ups”) during fiscal years 2018 and 2020 are still occurring and being reported in 2021. Hilcorp has informed the Trust that as it continues to refine further its estimating and reporting processes, Hilcorp will review prior periods to ensure greater accuracy and consistency, both for prior periods as well as future reporting periods. As part of that review process, Hilcorp informed the Trust that it will reverse and rebook revenue for certain prior periods. Thus, distributions to the Trust from Hilcorp in any given month may be subject to adjustments based upon prior months’ true-ups and rebooking, plus interest.
Hilcorp notified the Trust that as of the date of this Annual Report, it will still need to adjust the previously reported production and financial information for the production months of June through December 2018 for operated wells and June through December 2018 and July 2020 for non-operated wells and, therefore, possibly adjust future distributions of net proceeds to reflect such rebooking and true-ups plus interest on such amounts (as required by the Conveyance) to the extent an under-or over-payment has occurred.
In 2019, Hilcorp made true-up and rebooking adjustments resulting in an additional $325,000 gross ($244,000 net) Royalty Income revenue to the Trust based on the production months of August 2017, September 2017, October 2017, and January 2019. In 2020, Hilcorp made true-up and rebooking adjustments resulting in a reduction of $0.5 million gross ($0.4 million net) Royalty Income to the Trust based on the production months of August through December 2017, January through May 2018, and January 2019 through June 2020. This brings net true-ups during Hilcorp’s reconciliation process in 2019 and 2020 to a total reduction in Royalty Income of $175,000 gross ($131,000 net).
$2.0 Million in Additional “Other Gross” Proceeds Estimates. The Trust has been advised by Hilcorp that during the period following the closing of its purchase of the Subject Interests from Burlington, Hilcorp included an additional $1.0 million in “Other” revenue in the gross proceeds estimates in each of the December 2017 and January 2018 Trust distribution months. This additional $2.0 million in “Other” revenue was based on Hilcorp’s estimated increases in natural gas production that were subsequently offset by lower natural gas prices. In 2020 Hilcorp recouped the $2.0 million by reducing “Other” gross proceeds in the Trust distribution months of July, August, September and October 2020.
Results of Operations
Royalty Income
Royalty Income consists of monthly net proceeds attributable to the Royalty. Royalty Income for the two years ended December 31, 2020 was determined as shown in the following table:
(1) Estimated revenue from non-operated properties and granted audit exceptions with interest as a result of the 2018 audit, negatively offset by a reduction of $2.0 million in “Other” gross proceeds included in the December 2017 and January 2018 Trust distribution months, and further offset by Hilcorp’s true-ups and adjustments of non-operated revenue for the production months of August through December 2017, January through May 2018, February through July 2019, October and November 2019, and March through June 2020.
(2) Estimated revenue from outside operated properties, handling and processing income, and granted exceptions.
(3) Interest charges on excess production costs.
Gross Proceeds from Subject Interests. Gross proceeds decreased $14.6 million, or 27%, to $40.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $54.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due primarily to lower natural gas production and decreased natural gas prices,
The decrease also includes a one-time reimbursement by the Trust to Hilcorp of $2.0 million in “Other” gross proceeds previously included in the estimated gross proceeds paid to the Trust for the December 2017 and January 2018 distribution months. See “$2.0 Million in Additional “Other Gross” Proceeds Estimates” section above for further discussion.
Capital Expenditures. The capital expenditures reported by Hilcorp for 2020 included amounts attributable to the capital budgets for prior years because capital expenditures are deducted in calculating Royalty Income in the month they accrue, and projects within a given year’s budget often extend into subsequent years. With respect to any wells operated by third parties other than Hilcorp, Hilcorp’s share, if any, of capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 may not be paid until 2021 or later. For a summary of Hilcorp’s planned 2021 capital expenditures, see Liquidity and Capital Resources-2021 Capital Expenditure Budget.
Capital expenditures decreased $7.6 million, or 96%, to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to
Hilcorp’s reduced capital spending plan that the Trust announced on February 24, 2020 (the “2020 Plan”). Additionally, capital expenditures during the 2019 accounting period were abnormally high due to the recompletion of multiple wells and the drilling of a new well in the Fruitland Coal Formation. Hilcorp’s actual capital expenditures during its 2020 accounting period (which corresponds to the Trust’s distribution months of March 2020 through February 2021), totaled approximately $0.4 million. Hilcorp allocated its 2020 capital spending primarily towards facilities projects related to natural gas compression. Due to low prices for natural gas in 2020, Hilcorp did not conduct any new drill projects or recompletions within the Subject Interests in 2020.
Severance Taxes. Aggregate severance taxes decreased $0.6 million, or 12%, to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower revenue in 2020.
Lease Operating Expenses and Property Taxes. Lease operating expenses and property taxes decreased $5.0 million, or 17%, to $23.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Monthly operating expenses of the Subject Interests, including property taxes, in 2020 averaged approximately $2.0 million, compared to $2.4 million in 2019. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower compression, contract pumper and well servicing expenses in addition to decreases across other cost categories as Hilcorp was able to reduce operating costs in the current price environment.
Distributable Income
Distributable Income decreased $0.7 million, or 8%, to $7.4 million ($0.159164 per Unit) for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $8.1 million ($0.173594 per Unit) for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in Distributable Income from 2019 to 2020 was primarily attributable to decreased natural gas production, lower natural gas prices, and to true-ups and adjustments of prior periods by Hilcorp, resulting in lower Royalty Income.
The Trust did not receive Royalty Income from Hilcorp from June 2020 through September 2020 due primarily to true-ups of prior periods by Hilcorp. The true-ups resulted in excess production costs for the April 2020 production month. This led to there being no Distributable Income from June 2020 through September 2020, as Royalty Income otherwise earned was offset by the excess production costs. Additionally, during this period, the Trust paid administrative expenses out of its cash reserves. Because of this, the Royalty Income received in October 2020 was first used to replenish the Trust’s cash reserve, with remaining funds distributed to Unit Holders.
Interest Income. Interest Income in 2020 decreased as compared to 2019 due to lower yields on short-term investments because of the drawdown in the Trust’s reserves from the payment of the excess production costs.
General & Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased $0.4 million, or 22%, to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to differences in timing in the receipt and payment of certain expenses by the Trust and lower third-party compliance auditor costs.
Cash Reserves. Total cash reserves were $1.0 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Trust’s principal source of liquidity and capital is Royalty Income. The Trust’s distribution of income to Unit Holders is funded by Royalty Income after payment of Trust expenses. The Trust is not liable for any production costs or liabilities attributable to the Royalty. If at any time the Trust receives more than the amount due under the Royalty, it is not obligated to return such overpayment, but the amounts payable to it for any subsequent period are reduced by such amount, plus interest, at a rate specified in the Conveyance. If the Trustee determines that the Trust does not have sufficient funds to pay its liabilities, the Trustee may borrow funds on behalf of the Trust, in which case no distributions will be made to Unit Holders until such borrowings are repaid in full. The Trustee may not sell or dispose of any part of the assets of the Trust without the affirmative vote of the Unit Holders of 75% of all of the Units outstanding; however, the Trustee may sell up to 1% of the value of the Royalty (as determined pursuant to the Indenture) during any 12-month period without the consent of the Unit Holders.
In the event the Trust does not receive sufficient net cash payments from Hilcorp, the Trust believes it has sufficient capacity to draw upon the cash reserve amount or borrow funds against the Royalty to cover the Trust’s operating expenses for the following twelve-month period.
2021 Capital Expenditure Budget
On February 23, 2021, the Trust announced that Hilcorp had informed the Trust that its 2021 capital project plan for the Subject Interests (the “2021 Plan”) will allocate primarily all of its $0.3 million total towards facilities projects related to natural gas compression. Due to the current low prices for natural gas, Hilcorp informed the Trust that it does not plan to conduct any new drill projects or recompletions within the Subject Interests during 2021. However, Hilcorp advised the Trust that the 2021 Plan is subject to revision if Hilcorp changes its assumptions underlying the 2021 Plan, particularly changes in the prices of natural gas.
Contractual Obligations
As of December 31, 2020, the Trust had no obligations or commitments to make future contractual payments other than the trustee fee payable to the Trustee. Under the Indenture, the Trustee is entitled to an administrative fee for its administrative services and the preparation of quarterly and annual statements, computed as (i) 1/20 of 1% of the first $100 million of the annual gross revenue of the Trust, and 1/30 of 1% of the annual gross revenue of the Trust in excess of $100 million and (ii) the Trustee’s standard hourly rates for time in excess of 300 hours annually. The minimum administrative fee due under items (i) and (ii) is $36,000 per year. Administrative fees paid to the Trustee were $159,000 and $209,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
None.

Results of the 4th Quarters of 2020 and 2019
For the three months ended December 31, 2020, Distributable Income increased to $2.2 million ($0.047522 per Unit), or 2,685%, as compared to $79,000 ($0.001704 per Unit) for the three months ended December 31, 2019.
The increase in Distributable Income in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 resulted primarily from increased revenue from sales of natural gas and oil and decreased production costs. Additionally, there was no Distributable Income in October 2019 due to excess production costs and there was no Distributable Income in November 2019 because the Royalty Income received was applied to administrative expenses and to replenish previously drawn down cash reserves.
The Trustee is authorized to determine in its discretion the amount of cash reserves needed to pay liabilities and contingencies of the Trust. Total cash reserves were $1.0 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. Between June 2020 and September 2020, as a result of production costs exceeding Distributable Income, the Trust needed to utilize $397,090 of its cash reserves to pay Trust administrative expenses, The Trust replenished its cash reserves by $397,090 in October 2020 to bring the cash reserve balance back to the previously established amount of $1.0 million. The Trustee does not anticipate increasing or decreasing the established amount of cash reserves in 2021, although it cannot predict whether it will need to utilize some portion of those cash reserves during 2021.
Royalty Income of the Trust for the fourth quarter is based on actual gas and oil production during August through October of each year. Gas and oil sales for the quarters ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:
The average price of gas increased in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the same period of 2019 by $0.07 per Mcf. The average price per barrel of oil during the fourth quarter of 2020 was $11.93 lower than the price during the fourth quarter of 2019.
Capital costs for the fourth quarter of 2020 totaled approximately $0.1 million as compared to approximately $0.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The reduced capital costs in the fourth quarter of 2020 was due to Hilcorp’s reduced spending pursuant to the 2020 Plan.
Lease operating expenses and property taxes for the fourth quarter of 2020 averaged $1.9 million per month compared to $2.2 million per month in the fourth quarter of 2019. Lease operating expenses and property taxes were lower in the fourth quarter of 2020 than for the fourth quarter of 2019 due primarily to lower compression and pumping expenses in addition to decreases across other cost categories due to Hilcorp’s efforts to reduce operating costs in the current price environment.
Based on 46,608,796 Units outstanding, the per-Unit distributions during the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019 were as follows:
