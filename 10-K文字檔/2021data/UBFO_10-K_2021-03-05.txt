Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview
The Company
United Security Bancshares, a California corporation, is a bank holding company registered under the BHCA with corporate headquarters located in Fresno, California. The principal business of United Security Bancshares is to serve as the holding company for its wholly-owned subsidiary, United Security Bank. References to the “Bank” refer to United Security Bank together with its wholly-owned subsidiary, York Monterey Properties, Inc. References to the “Company” refer to United Security Bancshares together with its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. References to the “Holding Company” refer to United Security Bancshares, the parent company, on a stand-alone basis. The Bank currently has twelve banking branches, which provide financial services in Fresno, Madera, Kern, and Santa Clara counties in the state of California.
Current Trends Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Position
The Company’s overall operations are impacted by a number of factors, including not only interest rates and margin spreads, which impact the results of operations, but also the composition of the Company’s balance sheet. One of the primary strategic goals of the Company is to maintain a mix of assets that will generate a reasonable rate of return without undue risk, and to finance those assets with a low-cost and stable source of funds. Liquidity and capital resources must also be considered in the planning process to mitigate risk and allow for growth.
Since the Bank primarily conducts banking operations in California’s Central Valley, its operations and cash flows are subject to changes in the economic condition of the Central Valley. Our business results are dependent in large part upon the business activity, population, income levels, deposits and real estate activity in the Central Valley, and declines in economic conditions can have adverse material effects upon the Bank. In addition, the Central Valley remains largely dependent on agriculture. A downturn in agriculture and agricultural related business could indirectly and adversely affect the Company as many borrowers and customers are involved in, or are impacted to some extent, by the agricultural industry. While a great number of our borrowers are not directly involved in agriculture, they would likely be impacted by difficulties in the agricultural industry since many jobs in our market areas are ancillary to the regular production, processing, marketing and sale of agricultural commodities. Beginning in 2011, the state of California recently experienced one of the worst droughts in recorded history. While the drought has subsequently been declared over, it is not possible to quantify the drought's impact on businesses and consumers located in the Company's market areas or to predict adverse economic impacts related to future droughts. In response to the prolonged drought, the California state legislature passed the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act with the purpose to ensure better local and regional management of groundwater use and sustainable groundwater management in California by 2042. The local districts began to develop, prepare, and begin implementation of the Groundwater Sustainability Plans in 2020. The effect of such plans to Central Valley agriculture, if any, is still unknown.
The Company continually evaluates its strategic business plan as economic and market factors change in its market area. Balance sheet management, enhancing revenue sources, and maintaining market share will continue to be of primary importance.
COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the local economy in the Central Valley. Federal, State and local shelter-in-place recommendations were enacted in our markets in March 2020 causing many businesses to close and workers to be furloughed or lose jobs. Essential purpose entities such as medical professionals, food and agricultural businesses, and transportation and logistical businesses were exempted from the closures; however, unemployment rates are increasing in our local market area. As of December 2020, the unemployment rate in Fresno County was 10.4%. Congress, the President, and the Federal Reserve have taken several actions designed to cushion the economic fallout. Most notably, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was signed into law at the end of March 2020 as a $2 trillion legislative package, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 was signed into law at the end of December 2020 as a $900 billion legislative package. The goal of the CARES Act and Consolidated Appropriations Act, were to prevent a severe economic downturn through various measures, including direct financial aid to American families and economic stimulus to significantly impacted industry sectors. The package also includes extensive emergency funding for hospitals and providers. In addition to the general impact of COVID-19, certain provisions of the CARES Act as well as other recent legislative and regulatory relief efforts may have a material impact on our operations. While it is not possible to know the full universe or extent of these impacts as of the date this filing, we are disclosing potentially material items of which we are aware.
Financial position and results of operations
Pertaining to the Company's December 31, 2020 financial condition and results of operations, COVID-19 has had an impact on the allowance for credit losses. While the Company has not yet experienced any charge-offs related to COVID-19, its allowance for credit loss calculation and resulting provision for credit losses are significantly impacted by changes in economic conditions resulting from a significant increase in unemployment. Given that economic scenarios have darkened significantly since the pandemic was declared in early March 2020, the credit risk in the loan portfolio has increased resulting in the need for an additional reserve for credit loss. Should economic conditions worsen, the Company could experience further increases in its required allowance for credit loss and record additional provision expense.
The Company's interest income could be reduced due to COVID-19. In keeping with guidance from regulators, the Company is actively working with COVID-19 affected borrowers to defer their payments, interest, and fees. Interest and fees will still accrue to income pursuant to normal GAAP accounting policies. Should eventual credit losses on these deferred payments emerge, interest income and fees accrued would need to be reversed. In such a scenario, interest income in future periods could be negatively impacted. At this time, the Company is unable to project the materiality of such an impact, but recognizes the breadth of the economic impact may affect its borrowers’ ability to repay in future periods.
Capital and liquidity
As of December 31, 2020, the Company and Bank's capital ratios were in excess of all regulatory requirements. The Company's management team believes that while the Company and Bank have sufficient capital to withstand an extended economic recession brought about by COVID-19, its reported and regulatory capital ratios could be adversely impacted by further credit losses. The Company relies on cash on hand as well as dividends from the Bank to service its debt. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends for an extended period of time, the Company may not be able to service its debt.
The Company maintains access to multiple sources of liquidity. If an extended recession caused large numbers of its deposit customers to withdraw their funds, it might become more reliant on volatile or more expensive sources of funding. Wholesale funding markets are available to the Company, but rates for short-term funding have recently been volatile. If funding costs are elevated for an extended period of time, it could have an adverse effect on net interest margin.
Asset valuation
Currently, the Company does not expect COVID-19 to affect its ability to account timely for the assets on the balance sheet; however, this could change in future periods. While certain valuation assumptions and judgments will change to account for pandemic-related circumstances such as widening credit spreads, the Company does not anticipate significant changes in methodology used to determine the fair value of assets measured in accordance with GAAP.
The Company's stock closed below book value at the end of the first three quarters of 2020. Management deemed the decline in stock price and the COVID-19 related economic downturn to be a triggering event to perform a qualitative assessment for goodwill impairment for the first three quarters of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's stock price has recovered. Management engaged a third party valuation specialist to assist with the performance of the quantitative goodwill impairment test as of the fourth quarter 2020. Based on this quantitative test, it was determined that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value as of December 31, 2020, therefore, there was no impairment of goodwill recorded. COVID-19 could cause a further and sustained decline in the Company's stock price which could cause the Company to re-perform a goodwill impairment test and that could result in an impairment charge being recorded for that period. In the event that all or a portion of goodwill is impaired, a non-cash charge for the amount of such impairment would be recorded to earnings. Such a charge would have no impact on tangible capital or regulatory capital. At December 31, 2020, the Company had goodwill of $4,488,000, representing approximately 3.8% of equity.
Business Continuity Plan and controls
The Company maintains a Business Continuity Plan to prepare, and respond to unforeseen circumstances, such as, natural disasters and pandemics. Upon the COVID-19 pandemic declaration, the Company invoked its Business Continuity Plan. Shortly after invoking the plan, the Company implemented protocols for team member safety, provided timely communication to team members and customers, established remote work capabilities to isolate certain personnel essential to critical business continuity operations, and initiated strategies for monitoring and responding to local COVID-19 impacts. Due to the nature of their functions, many team members continue to operate from physical Company locations, while effectively employing social distancing standards. The Company's Management Team continues to meet regularly to anticipate and respond to any future
COVID-19 interruptions or developments. As of December 31, 2020, the Company does not anticipate significant challenges to its ability to maintain its systems and controls in light of the measures it has taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The Company does not currently face any material resource constraint through the implementation of its business continuity plans.
Lending operations and accommodations to borrowers
In keeping with regulatory guidance to work with borrowers during this unprecedented situation, the Company is executing a payment deferral program for our commercial lending clients that are adversely affected by the pandemic. Depending on the demonstrated need of the client, the Company is deferring either the full loan payment or the principal component of the loan payment for up to six months. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 1 remaining payment modification of $12,500,000 in connection with the COVID-19 relief provided by the CARES Act and interagency guidance issued in March 2020.
With the passage of the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), administered by the Small Business Administration ("SBA"), the Company participated in assisting our customers with applications for resources through the program. The PPP program ended on August 8, 2020. PPP loans have a two-year term and earn interest at 1%. The Company believes that the majority of these loans will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA in accordance with the terms of the program. As of December 31, 2020, there were 84 SBA PPP loans representing $9,547,000 in funding and $515,000 in unearned fees. The Company is participating in the second round of the PPP program which commenced in January 2021.
The Company is working with customers directly affected by COVID-19. The Company is prepared to offer short-term assistance in accordance with regulatory guidelines. As a result of the current economic environment caused by the COVID-19 virus, the Company is engaging in more frequent communication with borrowers to better understand their situation and the challenges faced, allowing it to respond proactively as needs and issues arise. The Company is engaging in more frequent communication with the servicer and individual schools participating in the student loan portfolio to better understand the effects of COVID-19 on students in school or in clinical programs. It is possible that the Company’s asset quality measures could worsen at future measurement periods if the effects of COVID-19 are prolonged.
The Company continually evaluates its strategic business plan as economic and market factors change in its market area. The Company may see a short-term slowdown in new loan originations due to COVID-19. Balance sheet management, enhancing revenue sources, and maintaining market share will continue to be of primary importance for the Company.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. As this information changes, the financial statements will reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments. Certain policies have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments and may result in the possible production of results that could be materially different from those originally reported. Estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value results inherently in more financial statement volatility. The fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third-party sources, when available. When third-party information is not available, valuation adjustments are estimated based upon assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
The most significant accounting policies are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and the financial review, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the financial statement sensitivity to underlying methods, assumptions, and estimates, the allowance for credit losses, other real estate owned through foreclosure, impairment of investment securities, revenue recognition, nonaccrual income recognition, fair value estimates on junior subordinated debt, valuation for deferred income taxes and goodwill require the most subjective judgments and may be subject to revision as new information becomes available.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of probable incurred credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment. The use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions may be susceptible to significant variations. The loan portfolio represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet. Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses. A discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for credit losses is included in the Asset Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses section of this financial review.
Other Real Estate Owned
Real estate properties acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are to be sold and are initially recorded at fair value of the property, less estimated costs to sell. The excess, if any, of the loan amount over the fair value of the collateral is charged to the allowance for credit losses. The determination of fair value is generally based upon pre-approved, external appraisals. Subsequent declines in the fair value of other real estate owned, along with related revenue and expenses from operations, are charged to noninterest expense. The fair market valuation of such properties is based upon estimates and is subject to change as circumstances in the market area, or general economic trends, fluctuate.
Impairment of Investment Securities
Investment securities are impaired when the amortized cost exceeds fair value. Investment securities are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) at least quarterly, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. Management considers the extent and duration of the unrealized loss and assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is likely that it will be required to sell the security before the anticipated recovery. If the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized as impairment through earnings.
For investment securities that do not meet the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell, the present value of the remaining cash flows as estimated at the preceding evaluation date are compared to the current expected remaining cash flows to determine OTTI related to credit loss. The amount of OTTI related to credit loss is recognized in earnings, with the balance recognized in other comprehensive income.
Revenue Recognition
The Bank's primary sources of revenue is interest income from both the loan portfolio and investment securities. Interest income is generally recorded on an accrual basis, unless the collection of such income is not reasonably assured or cannot be reasonably estimated. Pursuant to accounting standards related to revenue recognition, nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans are recognized as a yield adjustment to the related loans by amortizing them into income over the term of the loan using a method which approximates the interest method. Other credit-related fees, such as standby letter of credit fees and loan placement fees are recognized as noninterest income during the period the related service is performed.
For loans placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued and unpaid interest receivable may be reversed at management's discretion based upon management's assessment of collectability. Interest is thereafter credited to principal to the extent necessary to eliminate doubt as to the collectability of the net carrying amount of the loan.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill and intangible assets are evaluated at least annually for impairment or more frequently if events or circumstances, such as changes in economic or market conditions, indicate that impairment may exist. When required, the goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. The first test for goodwill impairment is done by comparing the reporting unit’s aggregate fair value to its carrying value. Absent other indicators of impairment, if the aggregate fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and no additional analysis is necessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit were to exceed the aggregate fair value, a second test would be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. To measure any impairment loss, the implied fair value would be determined in the same manner as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill, an impairment charge would be recorded for the difference. (See Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.)
Fair Value
Effective January 1, 2007, a fair value option accounting standard was applied to the Company's junior subordinated debt. Concurrently, the accounting standards related to fair value measurements were adopted. The accounting standards related to fair value measurements define how applicable assets and liabilities are to be valued, and requires expanded disclosures in regard to financial instruments carried at fair value. The fair value measurement accounting standard establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability. Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices, or whose fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices of related financial instruments, generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments infrequently traded or not quoted in an active market will generally have little or no pricing observability and a higher degree of subjectivity. Pricing observability is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market, and the characteristics specific to the transaction. Determining fair values under the accounting standards may include judgments related to measurement factors that may vary from actual transactions executed in the marketplace. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, fair value adjustments related to the junior subordinated debt resulted in losses of $174,000 and $661,000, respectively. (See Notes 10 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about financial instruments carried at fair value.)
Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes are measured using current tax rates applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered. If future income is not sufficient to apply the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied, the deferred tax asset may not be realized and income will be reduced. No valuation allowances were recorded against the deferred tax asset at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
On January 1, 2007, accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes were adopted. The standard prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Under the accounting standards, an entity should recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position if it determines that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination. The term “more likely than not” means a likelihood of more than 50 percent. In assessing whether the more-likely-than-not criterion is met, the entity should assume that the tax position will be reviewed by the applicable taxing authority.
Pursuant to the accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes, tax positions will be continually reevaluated. If it is determined that the tax positions are not “more likely than not” to be sustained (as defined by taxing authorities), additional tax liabilities may be recognized.
Results of Operations
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $8,961,000 or $0.53 per basic share ($0.53 diluted) compared to $15,172,000 or $0.90 per basic share ($0.89 diluted) for year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $6,211,000 between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020 is primarily the result of decreases in net interest income, resulting from lower interest rates, and the $2,769,000 provision for credit losses recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest income decreased by $6,825,000, or 16.53%, between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020. Taxes on income decreased by $2,646,000, or 43.40%.
Return on average assets was 0.86% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 1.58% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Return on average equity was 7.55% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 13.30% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
As with variances in net income, changes in the return on average assets and average equity experienced by the Company during 2020 and 2019 were effected by decreases in net interest income, resulting from a decline in interest rates, and higher provision for credit losses.
The following table sets forth certain selected financial data for each of the years in the five-year periods ended December 31, 2020, and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed information and financial statements contained elsewhere herein:
Net Interest Income
Net interest income, the most significant component of earnings, is the difference between the interest and fees received on earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Earning assets consist primarily of loans and, to a lesser extent, investments in securities issued by federal, state and local authorities, and corporations, as well as interest-bearing deposits and overnight investments in federal funds loaned to other financial institutions. These earning assets are funded by a combination of interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing liabilities, primarily customer deposits, and may include short-term and long-term borrowings.
Net interest income before provision for credit losses was $32,167,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing a decrease of $5,227,000, or 13.98%, compared to net interest income before provision for credit losses of $37,394,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. As market rates decreased in the current year, even a disciplined deposit pricing effort saw the net interest margin, as shown in Table 1 below, decrease to 3.34% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The net interest margin was 4.22% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Table 1. Distribution of Average Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity:
The following table summarizes the distribution of average assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity, as well as interest income and yields earned on average interest-earning assets and interest expense and rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities, presented on a tax equivalent basis for the years indicated:
(1) Loan amounts include nonaccrual loans, but the related interest income has been included only if collected for the period prior to the loan being placed on a nonaccrual basis. Loan interest income includes loan fees of approximately $1,226 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and loan costs of approximately $676 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
At the end of 2019 the prime rate was 4.75%. The prime rate decreased to 3.25% during the first quarter of 2020 and remained unchanged through the end of 2020. Future increases and decreases will affect rates for both interest income and expense and the resultant net interest margin.
Both net interest income and net interest margin are affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as "volume change." Both are also affected by changes in yields on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as "rate change." The following table sets forth the changes in interest income and interest expense for each major category of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability, and the amount of change attributable to volume and rate changes for the periods indicated.
Table 2. Rate and Volume Analysis
The net interest margin decreased in 2020 due to decreases in loan portfolio yields, yields of overnight investments with the Federal Reserve Bank ("FRB"), and investment securities yields, offset.by decreases in interest expense. The decreases in yields are a result of repricing of variable rate loans, floating rate investment securities, and interest-bearing deposits in FRB to lower rates. Interest-bearing deposits in FRB are the Company's lowest-yielding interest-earning asset. Loans yielded 4.96% during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 5.91% for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, total interest income decreased approximately $6,825,000, or 16.53%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, reflective of decreases of $2,311,000 and $4,150,000 in loan interest income and income on interest bearing deposits with the FRB, respectively. Average interest-earning assets increased approximately $76,813,000 between 2020 and 2019 and the rate on interest-earning assets decreased 109 basis points during the two periods. The increase in average earning assets between 2020 and 2019 consisted of an increase of $19,229,000 in investment securities and an increase of $63,800,000 in loans, offset by a decreases of $6,215,000 in interest-bearing deposits held with the FRB.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, total interest expense decreased approximately $1,598,000, or 41.10%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Between the two periods, average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $18,577,000, and the average rates paid on these liabilities decreased by 32 basis points. While the Company may utilize brokered deposits as an additional source of funding, the Company held no brokered deposits at December 31, 2020.
The following table summarizes the year-to-date averages of the components of interest-earning assets as a percentage of total interest-earning assets, and the components of interest-bearing liabilities as a percentage of total interest-bearing liabilities:
Provision for Credit Losses
Provisions for credit losses are determined on the basis of management's periodic credit review of the loan portfolio, consideration of past loan loss experience, current and future economic conditions, and other pertinent factors. After reviewing these factors, management, at times, makes adjustments in order to maintain an allowance for credit losses adequate for the coverage of estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Based on the condition of the loan portfolio, management believes the allowance is appropriate to cover risk elements in the loan portfolio.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, a $2,769,000 provision was made to the allowance for credit losses. A provision was made for the year ended December 31, 2019 and totaled $20,000.
The allowance for credit losses decreased to 1.30% of total loans during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 1.33% at December 31, 2019. The provision of $20,000 recorded in 2019, and the provision of $2,769,000 recorded during 2020, are a result of charge-offs recognized within the student loan portfolio and adjustment in qualitative factors related to the economic uncertainties caused by COVID-19. For further discussion, refer to Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Asset Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses.
Noninterest Income
The following table summarizes significant components of noninterest income for the years indicated and the net changes between those years:
Noninterest income consists primarily of fees and commissions earned on services provided to banking customers, fair value adjustments to the value of the junior subordinated debentures, and, to a lesser extent, gains on sales of Company assets and other miscellaneous income.
Noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $580,000, or 10.08%, when compared to the same period of 2019. Customer service fees, the primary component of noninterest income, decreased $594,000, or 18.24%, between the two periods presented. The decrease in customer service fees is primarily the result of the Company's election to lower fees and waive certain surcharges related to insufficient funds and electronic transfers in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The decrease in noninterest income of $580,000 between the two periods is partially the result of a recorded gain on the fair value of junior subordinated debentures of $970,000 during 2020 as compared to a gain of $1,165,000 during 2019. The change in the fair value of junior subordinated debentures was primarily caused by fluctuations in the LIBOR yield curve.
Noninterest Expense
The following table sets forth the components of total noninterest expense in dollars and as a percentage of average earning assets for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Noninterest expense increased $301,000, or 1.38%, between the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The net increase in noninterest expense between the comparative periods is primarily the result of increases in the cost on operation of OREO and regulatory assessments, offset by decreases in professional fees, data processing fees, and salaries and employee benefits. The increase in OREO costs are attributed to a $727,000 write-down on one property and a $113,000 loss on sale of another property. The increase in regulatory assessments was due to an increase in the assessment rate. Included in net costs on operations of OREO for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are OREO operating expenses totaling $133,000 and $244,000, respectively. The decrease in professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 is attributed to decreases in legal fees and consulting expense.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $426,000 ($0.02 per share basic and diluted) and $349,000 ($0.02 per share basic and diluted), respectively. This expense is included in noninterest expense under salaries and employee benefits. If new stock options or units are issued, or existing options fail to vest due, for example, to forfeiture, actual stock-based compensation expense in future periods will change.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense is impacted to some degree by permanent taxable differences between income reported for book purposes and income reported for tax purposes, as well as certain tax credits which are not reflected in the statements of operations and comprehensive income. As pretax income or loss amounts become smaller, the impact of these differences become more significant and are reflected as variances in the effective tax rate for the periods presented. In general, the permanent differences and tax credits affecting tax expense have a positive impact and tend to reduce the effective tax rates shown in the statements of operations and comprehensive income. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 27.80% compared to 28.67% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The Company's tax position is reviewed at least quarterly based upon accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes. An individual tax position must meet certain criteria for some or all of the income tax benefit to be recognized in a taxable entity’s financial statements. Under the income tax guidelines, an entity should recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position if it determines that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination. The term “more likely than not” means a likelihood of "more than 50 percent.” In assessing whether the more-likely-than-not criterion is met, the entity should assume that the tax position will be reviewed by the applicable taxing authority.
The Company's tax position was reviewed as of December 31, 2020, and it has been determined that there are no material amounts that should be recorded under the current income tax accounting guidelines.
Financial Condition
Total assets increased by $135,735,000, or 14.18%, from $956,919,000 at December 31, 2019 to $1,092,654,000 at December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, net loans increased by $57,179,000. Investment securities increased by $6,104,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020, and overnight interest-bearing deposits in the Federal
Reserve Bank and federal funds sold increased a net $72,875,000. Total deposits of $952,651,000 at December 31, 2020, increased $134,289,000, or 16.41%, from $818,362,000 at December 31, 2019.
Interest-earning assets averaged approximately $947,773,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $870,960,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased to $545,564,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $526,987,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Loans
The Company's primary business is that of acquiring deposits and making loans, with the loan portfolio representing the largest component of earning assets. Loans totaled $655,411,000 at December 31, 2020, an increase of $58,037,000, or 9.72%, from total loans of $597,374,000 at December 31, 2019. During 2020, average loans increased 11.08% when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Average loans totaled $639,815,000 and $576,015,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The following table sets forth the amounts of loans outstanding by category and the category percentages as of the year-end dates indicated:
Loan volume continues to be highest in what has historically been the primary lending emphasis: real estate mortgage, and construction lending. Total loans increased $58,037,000 during 2020. There were increases of $29,057,000, or 9.98%, in real estate mortgage loans, $2,236,000, or 4.94%, in commercial and industrial loans, and $36,232,000, or 26.11%, in real estate construction and development loans. There were decreases of $8,370,000, or 12.0%, in installment loans and $1,118,000, or 2.1%, in agriculture loans. The Bank is subject to internal and regulatory limits of 115% of capital on the real estate construction and development portfolio and 300% of capital for the non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio, which also includes construction and development loans. At December 31, 2020, the real estate construction and development portfolio totaled 112% of capital and non-owner occupied commercial real estate totaled 291% of capital. The current limits may affect the ability of the Bank to significantly grow these segments of the loan portfolio. The Bank is not approaching internal or regulatory concentration limits in other loan segments.
The real estate mortgage loan portfolio totaling $320,294,000 at December 31, 2020, consists of commercial real estate, residential mortgages, and home equity loans. Commercial real estate loans have remained a significant percentage of total loans over the past year, amounting to 43.17% and 41.04%, of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Commercial real estate balances increased to $282,951,000 at December 31, 2020 from $245,183,000 at December 31, 2019. Commercial real estate loans are generally a mix of short to medium-term, fixed and floating rate instruments and are mainly secured by commercial income and multi-family residential properties. Residential mortgage loans are generally 30-year amortizing loans with maturities of between three and five years. These loans totaled $37,236,000 or 5.68% of the portfolio at December 31, 2020, and $45,881,000, or 7.68% of the portfolio at December 31, 2019. Real estate mortgage loans in total increased $29,057,000 during 2020 and increased $15,278,000, or 5.54%, during 2019. Residential mortgage loans are not generally a large part of the loan portfolio, but some residential mortgage loans have been made over the past several years to facilitate take-out loans for construction borrowers who were unable to obtain permanent financing elsewhere. The Company does purchase residential mortgage portfolios. The home equity loan portfolio totaled $107,000 at December 31, 2020, and $173,000 at December 31, 2019. Real estate construction and development loans, representing 26.7% and 23.2% of total loans at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, consist of loans for residential and
commercial construction projects, as well as land acquisition and development, or land held for future development. Loans in this category are secured by real estate including improved and unimproved land, as well as single-family residential, multi-family residential, and commercial properties in various stages of completion. All real estate loans have established equity requirements. Repayment on construction loans generally comes from long-term mortgages with other lending institutions obtained at completion of the project or from the sale of the constructed homes to individuals.
Purchased loan participations totaled $9,707,000 at December 31, 2020. There were $5,955,000 purchased loan participations held at December 31, 2019. Loan participations sold increased from $4,866,000, or 0.81%, of the portfolio at December 31, 2019, to $12,948,000, or 1.98%, at December 31, 2020.
At December 31, 2020, approximately 59.8% of commercial and industrial loans have floating rates and, although some may be secured by real estate, many are secured by accounts receivable, inventory, and other business assets. Construction loans are generally short-term, floating-rate obligations, which consist of both residential and commercial projects. Agricultural loans, are primarily short-term, floating rate loans for crop financing.
Included within the installment loan portfolio are $57,385,000 in student loans as of December 31, 2020, as compared to $65,800,000 at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $8,415,000. The student loan portfolio consists of unsecured loans to medical and pharmacy students currently enrolled in medical and pharmacy schools in the US and the Caribbean. The medical student loans are made to US citizens attending medical schools in the US and Antigua, while the pharmacy student loans are made to pharmacy students attending pharmacy school in the US. Upon graduation the loan is automatically placed on deferment for six months. This may be extended up to 48 months for graduates enrolling in internship, medical residency or fellowship. As approved the student may receive additional deferment for hardship or administrative reasons in the form of forbearance for a maximum of 24 months throughout the life of the loan. The outstanding balance of student loans that have not entered repayment status totaled $13,893,000 at December 31, 2020. Accrued interest on loans that have not entered repayment status totaled $4,682,000 at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, there were 944 loans within repayment, deferment, and forbearance which represented $28,906,000, $7,407,000, and $7,179,000 in outstanding balances respectively.
Repayment of the unsecured student loans is premised on the medical and pharmacy students graduating and becoming high wage earners. Under program guidelines repayment terms can vary per borrower, however repayment occurs on average within 10 to 20 years. Underwriting is premised on qualifying credit scores. The weighted average credit score for the portfolio is in the mid-700s. In addition, there are non-student co-borrowers for roughly one-third of the portfolio that provide additional repayment capacity. Graduation and employment placement rates are high for both medical and pharmacy students. The average student loan balance per borrower as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $44,000. Loan interest rates range from 2.88% to 7.88%.
At December 31, 2020, $28,906,000 in loans were in repayment compared to $24,986,000 as of December 31, 2019. Accrued interest on student loans was $4,974,000 and $5,678,000 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2020, the reserve against the student loan portfolio totaled $2,546,000. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2020, $125,000 in accrued interest receivable was reversed, due to charge-offs of $1,947,000. At December 31, 2019, the reserve totaled $2,091,000,000 and $43,000 in accrued interest was reversed due to charge-offs of $740,000. There were no TDRs within the portfolio as of December 31, 2020 or 2019.
The following table sets forth the Bank's student loan portfolio with activity from December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020:
Student Loan Finance Corporation (ZuntaFi) is the third-party servicer for the student loan portfolio. ZuntaFi provides servicing for the student loan portfolio, including application administration, processing, approval, documenting, funding, and collection. They also provide file custodial responsibilities. Except in cases where applicants/loans do not meet program requirements, or extreme delinquency, ZuntaFi provides complete program management. ZuntaFi is paid a monthly servicing fee based on the principal balance outstanding. This servicing fee is presented as part of professional fees within noninterest expense.
The following table sets forth the maturities of the Bank's loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. Amounts presented are shown by maturity dates rather than repricing periods:
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the average yield on loans was 4.96% and 5.91%, respectively. Rate floors are occasionally used to mitigate interest rate risk if interest rates fall, as well as to compensate for additional credit risk under current market conditions. The loan portfolio is generally comprised of short-term or floating-rate loans that adjust in alignment to changes in market rates of interest.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 60.8% and 54.2%, respectively, of the loan portfolio consisted of floating rate instruments, with the majority of those tied to the prime rate.
The following table sets forth the contractual maturities of the Bank's fixed and floating-rate loans at December 31, 2020. Amounts presented are shown by maturity dates rather than repricing periods, and do not consider renewals or prepayments of loans:
Securities
The following is a comparison of the amortized cost and approximate fair value of available-for-sale securities for the years indicated:
The contractual maturities of investment securities as well as yields based on amortized cost of those securities at December 31, 2020 are shown below. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, available-for-sale securities with an amortized cost of approximately $80,527,000 and $65,874,000, respectively (fair value of $81,420,000 and $65,683,000, respectively) were pledged as collateral for public funds and FHLB borrowings.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized unrealized gains of $74,000 related to marketable equity securities held at December 31, 2020 in the consolidated statements of income. During the year ended December 31, 2019, unrealized gains of $117,000 were recorded.
Deposits
The Bank attracts commercial deposits primarily from local businesses and professionals, as well as retail checking accounts, savings accounts and time deposits. Core deposits, consisting of all deposits other than time deposits of $250,000 or more and brokered deposits, continue to provide the foundation for the Bank's principal sources of funding and liquidity. Core deposits amounted to 97.8% and 97.5% of the total deposit portfolio at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Bank currently holds no brokered deposits as part of its continuing effort to maintain sufficient liquidity without a reliance on brokered deposits.
The following table sets forth the year-end amounts of deposits by category for the years indicated, and the dollar change in each category during the year:
The following table sets forth the year-end percentages of total deposits by category for the years indicated:
The Bank's deposit base consists of two major components represented by noninterest-bearing (demand) deposits and interest-bearing deposits. Interest-bearing deposits consist of time certificates, NOW and money market accounts, and savings deposits. During the year ended December 31, 2020, NOW and money market deposits increased $41,631,000, or 11.53%, noninterest-bearing deposits increased $79,947,000, or 25.63%, total time deposits decreased $3,880,000, or 5.93%, and savings accounts increased $16,591,000, or 20.72%
During the year ended December 31, 2019, noninterest-bearing deposits increased $19,230,000, or 6.57%, total time deposits decreased $17,032,000, or 25.37%, NOW and money market increased $20,489,000, or 6.02%, and savings accounts decreased $9,968,000, or 11.07%.
On a year-to-date average basis, total deposits increased $73,606,000, or 8.92%, between the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020. Interest-bearing deposits increased by $19,120,000, or 3.70%, and noninterest-bearing deposits increased $54,486,000, or 17.66%, during 2020. On average, balances increased in all categories between the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, except for time deposits.
The following table sets forth the average deposits and average rates paid on those deposits for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
(1) Included at December 31, 2020, are $21,217,000 in time certificates of deposit of $250,000 or more, of which $2,152,000 mature in three months or less, $13,880,000 mature between three to twelve months, and $5,185,000 mature in one to three years.
Short-term Borrowings
The Bank has access to short-term borrowings which may consist of federal funds purchased, discount window borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase (“repurchase agreements”), and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances as alternatives to retail deposit funds. Collateralized and uncollateralized lines of credit have been established with several correspondent banks. The FRB discount window, as well as a securities dealer, may also be accessed as needed. Funds may be borrowed in the future as part of the Company's asset/liability strategy, and may be used to acquire assets as deemed appropriate by management for investment purposes or for capital utilization purposes. Federal funds purchased represent temporary overnight borrowings from correspondent banks and are generally unsecured. Repurchase agreements are collateralized by mortgage backed securities and securities of U.S. Government agencies, and generally have maturities of one to six months, but may have longer maturities if deemed appropriate. FHLB advances are collateralized by investments in FHLB stock, securities, and certain qualifying mortgage loans. Additionally, borrowings collateralized by pledged loans may be secured from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (FRB). Credit lines are subject to periodic review by the credit lines grantors relative to the Company's financial statements. Lines of credit may be modified or revoked at any time.
Lines of credit with the FRB of $336,788,000 and $313,445,000, as well as FHLB lines of credit totaling $4,881,000 and $5,815,000 were held at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, the Company obtained a $10,000,000 uncollateralized line of credit during 2013 from Pacific Coast Bankers Bank, a $20,000,000 uncollateralized line of credit during 2014 from Zion's Bank, and a $10,000,000 uncollateralized line of credit during 2017 from Union Bank. At December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding balances drawn against any lines of credit. These lines of credit generally have interest rates tied to the Federal Funds rate or are indexed to short-term U.S. Treasury rates or LIBOR.
Asset Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses
Lending money is the principal business activity, and ensuring appropriate evaluation, diversification, and control of credit risks is a primary management responsibility. Losses are implicit in lending activities and the amount of such losses will vary, depending on the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio as affected by local economic conditions and the financial experience of borrowers.
The allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in existing loans and commitments to extend credit. The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based upon management's continuing assessment of various factors affecting the collectability of loans and commitments to extend credit, including current economic conditions, past credit experience, collateral, and concentrations of credit. There is no precise
method of predicting specific losses which may ultimately be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio. The conclusion that a loan may become uncollectible, either in part or in whole is judgmental and subject to economic, environmental, and other conditions which cannot be predicted with certainty. The allowance for credit losses is determined in accordance with GAAP and the guidelines set forth in the Revised Interagency Policy Statement on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (“Statement”) issued by banking regulators in December 2006. The Statement is a revision of the previous guidance released in July 2001, and outlines characteristics that should be used in the segmentation of the loan portfolio for analytical purposes such as including risk classification, past due status, type of loan, industry and collateral. It also outlines factors to consider when adjusting the loss factors for various segments of the loan portfolio and updates previous guidance that describes the responsibilities of the board of directors, management, and bank examiners regarding the allowance for credit losses. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 102, released during July 2001, provides additional guidance regarding methodologies and supporting documentation for the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses that are consistent with federal securities laws and the Commission’s interpretations. Their guidance is generally consistent with the guidance published by banking regulators.
The allowance for loan losses includes an asset-specific component, as well as a general or formula-based component. The loan portfolio is divided into eight (8) segments and categorized primarily by loan class homogeneity and commonality of purpose for analysis under the formula-based component of the allowance. Loans which are determined to be impaired under current accounting guidelines are not subject to the formula-based reserve analysis, and are instead evaluated individually for specific impairment under the asset-specific component of the allowance.
The eight segments of the loan portfolio are as follows (subtotals are provided as needed to allow the reader to reconcile the amounts to loan classifications reported elsewhere in this Report):
The methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses consists of several key elements, which include:
- the formula allowance;
- specific allowances for problem graded loans identified as impaired; and
- and the unallocated allowance.
The formula allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans and certain unfunded loan commitments. Loss factors are based on the historical loss experience and on the internal risk grade of those loans and may be adjusted for significant factors that, in management's judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date. Factors that may affect collectability of the loan portfolio include:
•Levels of, and trends in delinquencies and nonaccrual loans;
•Trends in volumes and term of loans;
•Effects of any changes in lending policies and procedures including those for underwriting, collection, charge-off, and recovery;
•Experience, ability, and depth of lending management and staff;
•National and local economic trends and conditions; and
•Concentrations of credit that might affect loss experience across one or more components of the portfolio, including high-balance loan concentrations and participations.
Management determines the loss factors for loans based on a loss migration model. The migration analysis incorporates loan losses over the previous quarters as determined by management (time horizons adjusted as business cycles or environment changes). Loss factors are adjusted to recognize and quantify the loss exposure due to changes in market conditions as well as trends in the loan portfolio. For purposes of analysis, loans are grouped by internal risk classifications and categorized as pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss. Certain loans are homogeneous in nature and are therefore pooled by risk grade. These homogeneous loans include consumer installment and home equity loans. Special mention loans are currently performing but are potentially weak, as the borrower has begun to exhibit deteriorating trends which, if not corrected, could jeopardize repayment of the loan and result in further downgrades. Substandard loans have well-defined weaknesses which, if not corrected, could jeopardize the full satisfaction of the debt. A loan classified as doubtful has critical weaknesses that make full collection of the obligation improbable. Classified loans include impaired loans and loans categorized as substandard, doubtful, and loss, which are not considered impaired. At December 31, 2020, impaired and classified loans totaled $13,390,000, or 2.04%, of gross loans as compared to $17,664,000, or 2.96%, of gross loans at December 31, 2019.
Loan participations are reviewed for allowance adequacy under the same guidelines as other loans in the portfolio, with an additional participation factor added, if required, for specific risks associated with participations. In general, participations are subject to certain thresholds and are reviewed for geographic location as well as the financial status of the underlying agent bank.
The formula allowance includes reserves for certain off-balance sheet risks including letters of credit, unfunded loan commitments, and lines of credit. Reserves for undisbursed commitments are generally formula allocations based on historical loss experience and other loss factors, rather than specific loss contingencies. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the formula reserve allocated to undisbursed commitments totaled $606,000 and $552,000, respectively. The reserve for unfunded commitments is considered a reserve for contingent liabilities and is therefore carried as a liability on the balance sheet for all periods presented.
Specific allowances are established based on management’s periodic evaluation of loss exposure inherent in impaired loans. For impaired loans, specific allowances are determined based on the net realizable value of the underlying collateral, the net present value of the anticipated cash flows, or the market value of the underlying assets. Formula allowances for classified loans, excluding impaired loans, are determined on the basis of additional risks involved with individual loans that may be in excess of risk factors associated with the loan portfolio as a whole. The specific allowance is different from the formula allowance in that the specific allowance is determined on a loan-by-loan basis based on risk factors directly related to a particular loan, as opposed to the formula allowance which is determined for a pool of loans with similar risk characteristics, based on past historical trends and other risk factors which may be relevant on an ongoing basis.
The unallocated portion of the allowance is based upon management’s evaluation of various conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances. The conditions may include, but are not limited to, general economic and business conditions affecting key lending areas, credit quality trends, collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, and other business conditions.
The following table summarizes the specific allowance, formula allowance, and unallocated allowance at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The following table summarizes allowance for loan losses, nonperforming loans, and classified loans for the periods shown:
Impaired loans decreased $3,696,000 between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020 and the specific allowance related to those impaired loans decreased $936,000 between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020. The level of “pass” loans increased approximately $48,544,000 between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, and the related formula allowance increased $1,506,000 during the same period. The formula allowance for "pass loans" is derived from loss factors using migration analysis and management's consideration of qualitative factors. The increase in formula allowance for "pass loans" was partially attributed to an adjustment in qualitative factor for COVID-19 related economic uncertainty. The unallocated reserve totaled $275,000, or 3.2% of the total allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2020, and $173,000, or 2.2%, of the total allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2019. In evaluating the level of the unallocated reserve, management considered loan relationships, construction and land development concentrations, and loss history relative to peers.
The specific allowance portion of the analysis is designed to be self-correcting by taking into account the current loan loss experience based on that segment of the portfolio. By analyzing the estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis, management is able to adjust specific and inherent loss estimates using the most recent information available. In performing the periodic migration analysis, management believes that historical loss factors used in the computation of the formula allowance need to be adjusted to reflect current changes in market conditions and trends in the loan portfolio. There are a number of other factors which are reviewed when determining adjustments in the historical loss factors. Those factors include (1) trends in delinquent and nonaccrual loans, (2) trends in loan volume and terms, (3) effects of changes in lending policies, (4)
concentrations of credit, (5) competition, (6) national and local economic trends and conditions, (7) experience of lending staff, (8) loan review and Board of Directors oversight, (9) high balance loan concentrations, and (10) other business conditions.
The general reserve requirements (ASC 450-70) were adjusted as a result of the overall condition of the local, state, and national economies and resultant impact on the local lending base. This has resulted in a lower qualitative component being used for the general reserve calculation. The stake-in-the-ground methodology requires the Company to use December 31, 2005 as the starting point of the look back period to capture loss history and better capture an entire economic cycle. Time horizons are subject to Management's assessment of the current period, taking into consideration changes in business cycles and environment changes.
Management and the Company’s lending officers evaluate the loss exposure of classified and impaired loans on a weekly basis and through discussions and officer meetings as conditions change. The Company’s Loan Committee meets weekly, serving as a forum to discuss specific problem assets that pose significant concerns to the Company and to keep the Board of Directors informed through committee minutes. All special mention and classified loans are reported quarterly on Problem Asset Reports and Impaired Loan Reports and are reviewed by senior management. Migration analysis and impaired loan analysis are performed on a quarterly basis and adjustments are made to the allowance as deemed necessary. The Board of Directors is kept abreast of any changes or trends in problem assets on a monthly basis, or more often if required.
The specific allowance for impaired loans is measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The amount of impaired loans is not directly comparable to the amount of nonperforming loans. The primary differences between impaired loans and nonperforming loans are: (i) all loan categories are considered in determining nonperforming loans while impaired loan recognition is limited to commercial and industrial loans, commercial and residential real estate loans, construction loans, and agricultural loans, and (ii) impaired loan recognition considers not only loans 90 days or more past due, restructured loans and nonaccrual loans but may also include problem loans other than delinquent loans.
A loan is considered to be impaired when, based upon current information and events, it is probable the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans include nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructures, and performing loans in which full payment of principal or interest is not expected. Management bases the measurement of these impaired loans either on the fair value of the loan's collateral or the expected cash flows on the loans discounted at the loan's stated interest rates. Cash receipts on impaired loans not performing to contractual terms and that are on nonaccrual status are used to reduce principal balances. Impairment losses are included in the allowance for credit losses through a charge to the provision, if applicable.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the recorded investment in loans for which impairment has been recognized totaled $13,376,000 and $17,072,000, respectively. Included in total impaired loans at December 31, 2020, are $682,000 of impaired loans for which the related specific allowance is $209,000, as well as $12,694,000 of impaired loans that, as a result of excess collateral or excess in the calculation of net present value of future cash flows, did not need a specific allowance. Total impaired loans at December 31, 2019 included $3,008,000 of impaired loans for which the related specific allowance was $1,145,000, as well as $14,064,000 of impaired loans that as a result of excess collateral or excess in the calculation of net present value of future cash flows, did not have a specific allowance. The average recorded investment in impaired loans was $15,374,000 and $18,125,000 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In most cases, the Company uses the cash basis method of income recognition for impaired loans. In the case of certain troubled debt restructuring for which the loan is performing under the current contractual terms, income is recognized under the accrual method.
The largest category of impaired loans at December 31, 2020 was real estate construction and development loans, comprising 82.66% of total impaired loans. Impaired commercial and industrial loans decreased $1,288,000, impaired real estate mortgage loans decreased $1,902,000, impaired construction loans decreased $421,000, and impaired agricultural loans decreased $85,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020. Specific collateral related to impaired loans is reviewed for current appraisal information, economic trends within geographic markets, loan-to-value ratios, and other factors that may impact the value of the loan collateral. Adjustments are made to collateral values as needed for these factors. Of total impaired loans, approximately $12,767,000, or 95.4%, were secured by real estate at December 31, 2020, as compared to $16,324,000, or 95.62%, of total impaired loans at December 31, 2019.
The following table summarizes the components of impaired loans and their related specific allowance at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Included in impaired loans are loans modified in troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), where concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties in an attempt to enhance collection. The Company makes various types of concessions when structuring TDRs including rate reductions, payment extensions, and forbearance.
At December 31, 2020, total TDRs of $3,426,000 included $2,452,000 in real estate construction balances, and, $365,000 in residential mortgage balances. At December 31, 2019, total TDRs of $5,187,000 included $2,654,000 in real estate construction balances and $1,060,000 in residential mortgage balances, with $898,000 in commercial real estate balances.
Total TDRs decreased by 33.95% at December 31, 2020, as compared to December 31, 2019. Nonaccrual TDRs increased by 3.32% and accruing TDRs decreased by 77.61% over the same period. All TDR categories decreased when compared on a year-over-year basis. Concessions granted include lengthened maturities and/or rate reductions that enabled the borrower to complete projects. In large part, current decreases are related to a recovering real estate market.
The following tables summarizes TDRs by type, classified separately as nonaccrual or accrual, which are included in impaired loans at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
Of the $3,426,000 in total TDRs at December 31, 2020, $2,891,000 were on nonaccrual status at period-end. Of the $5,187,000 in total TDRs at December 31, 2019, $2,798,000 were on nonaccrual status at period-end. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has no commercial real estate (CRE) workouts whereby an existing loan was restructured into multiple new loans.
For a restructured loan to return to accrual status there needs to be at least six months successful payment history. In addition, the Company’s Credit Administration performs a financial analysis of the credit to determine whether the borrower has the ability to continue to perform successfully over the remaining life of the loan. This includes, but is not limited to, a review of financial statements and a cash flow analysis of the borrower. Only after determining that the borrower has the ability to perform under the terms of the loans will the restructured credit be considered for accrual status.
The following table summarizes special mention loans by type for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
The Company focuses on competition and other economic conditions within its market area and other geographical areas in which it does business, which may ultimately affect the risk assessment of the portfolio. The Company continues to experience increased competition from major banks, local independents and non-bank institutions which creates pressure on loan pricing. The Company continues to place increased emphasis on reducing both the level of nonperforming assets and the level of losses on the disposition of these assets. It is in the best interest of both the Company and the borrowers to seek alternative options to foreclosure in an effort to reduce the impacts on the real estate market. As part of this strategy, the Company enters into troubled debt restructurings, when it improves collection prospects. While business and consumer spending have shown improvement over the last several years, it is difficult to forecast the impact COVID-19 will have on the economy. Local unemployment rates in the San Joaquin Valley have improved, but are expected to substantially increase due to closure of non-essential business and shelter-in-place orders. Management recognizes the increased risk of loss due to the Company's exposure to local and worldwide economic conditions, as well as potentially volatile real estate markets, and takes these factors into consideration when analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses.
The following table provides a summary of the Company's allowance for credit losses, provisions made to that allowance, and charge-off and recovery activity affecting the allowance for the years indicated.
Loan charge-offs increased $1,507,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Loan recoveries decreased $141,000 during the same period. Student loan charge-offs totaled $1,947,000 and $740,000 during the years ended 2020 and 2019, respectively. The charge-offs in the student loan portfolio were primarily related to the Antigua medical school loans. Additions to the overdraft reserve of $14,000 and $20,000 were made during the same periods.
The following is a summary of the quarterly activity in the allowance for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 (in thousands).
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, $606,000 and $552,000, respectively, of the formula allowance was allocated to unfunded loan commitments and was, therefore, carried separately in Other Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
Management believes that the 1.30% credit loss allowance to total loans at December 31, 2020 is adequate to absorb known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio. There is no guarantee, however, against economic conditions or other circumstances materializing which could adversely affect the Company's service areas resulting in increased losses in the loan portfolio not captured by the current allowance for loan losses. Management is not currently aware of any conditions that may adversely affect the levels of losses incurred in the Company’s loan portfolio.
The allocations to specific loan categories are estimates based upon the same factors considered by management in determining the amount of additional provisions to the credit loss allowance and the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. The unallocated portion provides for coverage of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio but not captured in the loss factors used in the risk rating-based component or in the specific impairment reserve component of the allowance for credit losses. The unallocated portion acknowledges the inherent imprecision of all loss prediction models.
During 2020, reserve allocations as a percentage of loans decreased for commercial and industrial, real estate mortgage, and agricultural loans. These decreases are a result of a combination of factors including decreases in charge-offs, classified and past due loans, and credit quality improvements. Increases in reserve allocations for real estate construction and development loans were primarily due to the growth of the loan segment, adjusted by the change in the qualitative factors related to portfolio concentrations and uncertainty related to COVID-19. Increases in reserve allocation for installment loans were a result of an increase in loss factors attributed to the student loan portfolio and qualitative adjustments related to student loan forbearance balances. The qualitative adjustments related to the student loan forbearance balances result in a 5% reserve for pharmacy school forbearance balances and a 15% reserve for medical school forbearance balances.
During 2019, reserve allocations as a percentage of loans decreased for commercial and industrial, real estate mortgage, and agricultural loans. These decreases are a result of a combination of factors including decreases in charge-offs, classified and past due loans, and credit quality improvements. Increases in reserve allocations for real estate construction an development loans were primarily due to the growth of the loan segment, adjusted by the change in the qualitative factors related to the nature and volume of the portfolio. Increases in reserve allocation for installment loans were a result of increases in the overall portfolio balances, and the addition of reserves related to student loans.
The following summarizes the allowance for credit losses related to the specific, formula, and unallocated reserves for the year-ends shown:
The total formula allowance has increased in the current period as a result of increased loan balances, qualitative adjustments for COVID-19, and the allowance attributed to student loans.
No loans were classified as doubtful at December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.
The accrual of interest income on loans is discontinued when reasonable doubt exists with respect to the timely collectability of interest or principal due to the inability of the borrower to comply with the terms of the loan agreement. Outside of student loans, loans are typically placed on nonaccrual status when the payment of principal or interest is 90 days past due or earlier when the conditions warrant. Interest collected thereafter is credited to principal to the extent necessary to eliminate doubt as to the collectability of the net carrying amount of the loan. Exceptions may be granted to this policy if the loans are well secured and in the process of collection.
The following table sets forth nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated:
(1) Included in nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are restructured loans totaling $2,891 and $2,797, respectively.
Non-performing assets at December 31, 2020 decreased $3,677,000 between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, due to decreases of $1,854,000 in accruing restructured loans, decreases of $201,000 in nonaccrual loans, and decreases in other real estate owned, offset by a slight increase in loans past due more than 90 days and still accruing.
Non-performing assets decreased $404,000 between December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019, due to decreases of $1,443,000 in accruing restructured loans and decreases of $355,000 in nonaccrual loans, offset by increases in other real estate owned and loans past due more than 90 days and still accruing.
The following table summarizes various nonperforming components of the loan portfolio as compared to total loans for the periods shown.
In determining the adequacy of the underlying collateral related to these loans, management monitors trends within specific geographical areas, loan-to-value ratios, appraisals, and other credit issues related to specific loans.
Management continues to monitor and reduce the level of problem assets by working with borrowers to identify options, such as loan restructures, which may help borrowers facing difficulties. Restructured loan numbers have been greatly reduced over the last four years. Net loan charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $2,155,000, as compared to net loan charge-offs of $507,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Approximately 49 loans were charged-off during the year
ended December 31, 2020, compared to 28 loans during the year ended December 31, 2019. Net loan charge-offs totaling $2,155,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020, included $494,000 in net charge-offs during the quarter ended March 31, 2020, $686,000 in net charge-offs during the quarter ended June 30, 2020, $158,000 in net charge-offs during the quarter ended September 30, 2020, and $817,000 in net charge-offs during the fourth quarter of 2020. Charge-offs of $1,947,000 during the year were related to the student loan portfolio. The percentage of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.34%, for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The loan portfolio increased from $597,374,000 at December 31, 2019 to $655,411,000 at December 31, 2020. Nonperforming loans decreased to $12,544,000 at December 31, 2020, from $14,472,000 at December 31, 2019. Nonaccrual loans and accruing restructured loans are included in nonperforming loans. During the same period, total impaired and classified loans decreased from $17,664,000 at December 31, 2019, to $13,390,000 at December 31, 2020.
The following table summarizes the nonaccrual totals by loan category for the periods shown:
Loans past due more than 30 days receive management attention and are monitored for increased risk. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019 loans past due more than 30 days totaled $11,126,000 and $12,355,000, respectively. Impaired loans, nonaccrual and restructured loans are reviewed for specific reserve allocations and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted accordingly.
Except for the loans included in the above tables, there were no loans at December 31, 2020, where the known credit problems of a borrower made doubtful the ability of such borrower to comply with the present loan repayment terms resulting in such loan being included as nonaccrual, past due, or restructured at some future date.
Liquidity and Asset/Liability Management
The primary function of asset/liability management is to provide adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities.
Liquidity
Liquidity management may be described as the ability to maintain sufficient cash flows to fulfill both on- and off-balance sheet financial obligations, including loan funding commitments and customer deposit withdrawals, without straining the Company’s equity structure. To maintain an adequate liquidity position, the Company relies on, in addition to cash and cash equivalents, cash inflows from deposits and short-term borrowings, repayments of principal on loans and investments, and interest income received. The Company's principal cash outflows are for loan origination, purchases of investment securities, depositor withdrawals and payment of operating expenses. Other sources of liquidity not on the balance sheet at December 31, 2020, include unused collateralized and uncollateralized lines of credit from other banks, the Federal Home Loan Bank, Pacific Coast Banker's Bank, Zion's Bank, Union Bank, and from the Federal Reserve Bank totaling $381,669,000.
Cash and cash equivalents have fluctuated during the three years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, with period-end balances as follows (from Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows - in 000’s):
Cash and cash equivalents increased $75,074,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020, and increased $1,342,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019.
The Company had a net cash inflow from operations of $13,800,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, and a net cash inflow from operations totaling $16,160,000 for the period ended December 31, 2019. The Company experienced net cash
outflows from investing activities totaling $65,547,000 and net cash outflows of $22,763,000 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company experienced net cash inflows from financing activities totaling $126,821,000 and $5,261,000, respectively, as increases in deposits outweighed purchases of available for sale securities and loan growth.
Liquidity risk arises from the possibility the Company may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments, or the Company may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources. The Company maintains a liquidity risk management policy to address and manage this risk. The policy identifies the primary sources of liquidity, sets wholesale funding limits, establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity, and establishes minimum liquidity requirements in compliance with regulatory guidance. The liquidity position is continually monitored and reported on a monthly basis to the Board of Directors.
The policy also includes a contingency funding plan to address liquidity needs in the event of an institution-specific or systemic financial market crisis. In addition to unused lines of credit from other banks totaling $381,669,000, the contingency plan includes identified funding sources and steps to be taken if liquidity ratios fall or are projected to fall below policy limits for an extended period of time. One of the primary directives of the contingency funding plan is to limit the Company’s overall level of wholesale funding to no more than 25% of deposits. The current funding program uses both asset-based and liability-based principles, and identifies core deposits as the favored funding source when attainable at a reasonable cost. The policy identifies a number of funding sources or methods the Bank's ALCO committee may utilize to fulfill the Company’s liquidity funding requirements:
1)Local core deposits are the Company’s primary funding source. The Company works to attract these deposits through service-related and competitive pricing tactics. Other liquidity funding sources are considered if local core deposits are not attractive due to maturity or pricing.
2)Unsecured Federal Funds lines with correspondent banks may be used to fund short-term peaks in loan demand or deposit run-off. Currently, unsecured borrowing lines with correspondents are limited and may not be reliable for long periods of time or in times of economic stress.
3)Other funding sources such as secured credit lines with the Federal Home Loan Bank or the Federal Reserve may be used for longer periods. These credit lines are collateralized by investment securities and pledged loans. The Company utilizes specific loan pledging with the Federal Reserve to better ensure the continued availability of those lines of credit.
4)The Company presently has a Discount Window facility available from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco collateralized with loans as discussed above. At December 31, 2020, the Company had available credit of $336,788,000 from the Federal Reserve based upon the loans pledged at that date. The Federal Reserve will monitor use of the Discount Window closely given the current status of the Company and the economy as a whole. This credit facility may not be competitively priced under certain economic conditions. As such, the Company does not expect to use this facility except for short periods, but does consider this to be a key contingency funding source.
5)As long as the Bank remains “Well Capitalized,” the Company may rely on brokered deposits when core deposit rates are higher in the marketplace or maturity structures are not desirable. The Company’s current policy limit for brokered deposits is 25% of total deposits. The Company may also utilize other wholesale deposit sources such as memberships that advertise the Bank’s time deposit rates to other subscribers such as banks and credit unions. The Company’s current policy limit on other wholesale deposits is 25% of total deposits.
6)The Bank may sell whole loans or participations in loans to provide additional liquidity. During economic downturns or other crisis events, these funding sources may be difficult to achieve in a short period of time or at a reasonable price. As such, this strategy is better used as a long-term asset/liability management tool to effectively balance assets and liabilities in order to reduce liquidity risk.
7)The Company currently holds Bank-Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) and Corporate-Owned Life Insurance (COLI) policies issued by highly rated insurance companies. These policies may be sold to increase liquidity.
8)The Company owns certain real estate including its administration building and several of its branches. These may be sold and vacated or leased back from the purchaser after sale to provide additional liquidity if needed. The sales process may require substantial time to complete, and may have an adverse impact on earnings depending on market rates and other factors at the time of sale.
9)Investments nearing maturity may be sold to meet temporary funding needs but may need to be replaced to maintain liquidity ratios within acceptable limits. At the current time approximately half of the investment portfolio is pledged to secure public deposits and borrowing lines. The Company seeks to maintain an investment-graded securities portfolio to ensure quality collateral for pledging against borrowing lines of credit as well as to provide liquidity in times of need.
The Company's liquid asset base, which generally consists of cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell (“reverse repos”) and investment securities, is maintained at levels deemed sufficient to provide the cash necessary to fund loan growth and deposit runoff. Included in this framework is the objective of maximizing the yield on earning assets. This is generally achieved by maintaining a high percentage of earning assets in loans, which historically have represented the Company's highest yielding asset. At December 31, 2020, loans represented 59.89% of total assets and accounted for a loan to deposit ratio of 68.69%, as compared to 62.34% of total assets and a loan to deposit ratio of 72.90% at December 31, 2019. Liquid assets at December 31, 2020 include cash and cash equivalents totaling $294,069,000, as compared to $218,995,000 at December 31, 2019.
Liabilities used to fund liquidity sources include core and non-core deposits as well as short-term borrowings capability. Core deposits, which comprised approximately 97.77% of total deposits at December 31, 2020, provide a significant and stable funding source for the Company. At December 31, 2020, unused lines of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank, Pacific Coast Banker's Bank, Zion's Bank, Union Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank totaling $381,669,000 were collateralized in part by certain qualifying loans in the Company’s loan portfolio. The carrying value of loans pledged on these used and unused borrowing lines totaled $517,516,000 at December 31, 2020. For a further discussion of the Company’s borrowing lines, see “Short Term Borrowings” in the Financial Condition section of Management's Discussion and Analysis.
The liquidity of the parent company, United Security Bancshares, is separate from the Bank and is primarily dependent on the payment of cash dividends by its subsidiary, United Security Bank, subject to limitations imposed by the Financial Code of the State of California and federal and state banking regulations. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Bank paid $8,025,000 and $8,346,000 in cash dividends to the parent company, respectively.
Regulatory Matters
Capital Adequacy
The Company (on a consolidated basis) and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements adopted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Board of Governors”). Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandates and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework, the consolidated Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.
The Company has adopted a capital plan that includes guidelines and trigger points to ensure sufficient capital is maintained at the Bank and the Company, and that capital ratios are maintained at a level deemed appropriate under regulatory guidelines given the level of classified assets, concentrations of credit, allowance for credit losses, current and projected growth, and projected retained earnings. The capital plan also contains contingency strategies to obtain additional capital as required to fulfill future capital requirements for both the Bank, as a separate legal entity, and the Company on a consolidated basis. The capital plan requires the Bank to maintain a ratio of tangible shareholders' equity to total tangible assets equal to or greater than 9%. The Bank’s ratio of tangible shareholders’ equity to total tangible assets was 11.2% and 12.7% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
For a more detailed discussion of the capital adequacy requirements, see “Item 1 - Business - Supervision and Regulation - The Holding Company - Capital Adequacy” and “Item 1 - Business - Supervision and Regulation - The Bank - Capital Standards.”
The following table sets forth the Company’s and the Bank's actual capital positions at December 31, 2020 and 2019, as well as the minimum capital requirements under the regulatory guidelines:
(1) Current data is not applicable as the Bank and Company have adopted the Community Bank Leverage Ratio Framework as of the third quarter of 2020.
(2) The minimum required Community Bank Leverage Ratio is 9.00%, but the CARES Act temporarily lowers this to 8% as described below.
(3) The Company was subject to these minimum requirements under the regulatory framework for Prompt Corrective Action at December 31, 2019.
(4) If the subsidiary bank’s Leverage Ratio exceeds the minimum ratio under the Community Bank Leverage Ratio Framework, it is deemed to be “well capitalized” under all other regulatory capital requirements. The Company may revert back to the regulatory framework for Prompt Corrective Action if the subsidiary bank’s Leverage Ratio falls below the minimum under the Community Bank Leverage Ratio Framework.
The federal banking agencies published a final rule on November 13, 2019, that provided a simplified measure of capital adequacy for qualifying community banking organizations. A qualifying community banking organization that opts into the community bank leverage ratio framework and maintains a leverage ratio greater than 9 percent will be considered to have met the minimum capital requirements, the capital ratio requirements for the well capitalized category under the Prompt Corrective Action framework, and any other capital or leverage requirements to which the qualifying banking organization is subject. A qualifying community banking organization with a leverage ratio of greater than 9 percent may opt into the community bank leverage ratio framework if it has average consolidated total assets of less than $10 billion, has off-balance-sheet exposures of 25% or less of total consolidated assets, and has total trading assets and trading liabilities of 5 percent or less of total consolidated assets. Further, the bank must not be an advance approaches banking organization.
The final rule became effective January 1, 2020 and banks that meet the qualifying criteria can elect to use the community bank leverage framework starting with the quarter ended March 31, 2020. The CARES Act reduced the required community bank leverage ratio to 8% until the earlier of December 31, 2020, or the national emergency is declared over. The federal bank regulatory agencies adopted an interim final rule to implement this change from the CARES Act. The Company and the Bank meet the criteria outlined in the final rule and the interim final rule and have adopted the community bank leverage ratio framework in the third quarter 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company and the Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. Management believes that, under the current regulations, both will continue to meet their minimum capital requirements in the foreseeable future.
Dividends
Dividends paid to shareholders are subject to restrictions set forth in the California General Corporation Law. The California General Corporation Law provides that distributions may be made to shareholders if retained earnings immediately prior to the dividend payment are at least equal to the amount of the proposed distribution or if, immediately after the distribution, the value of assets equals the sum of total liabilities. The primary source of funds with which dividends will be paid to shareholders come from cash dividends received by the Holding Company from the Bank.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Holding Company paid $7,468,000 in cash dividends to shareholders. The Bank paid cash dividends of $8,025,000 to the Holding Company in order to fund the Holding Company's operating costs, payments of interest on junior subordinated debentures, estimated tax payments, and cash dividends paid to shareholders. The balance of junior subordinated debentures remained at $12.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
The Bank, as a state-chartered bank, is subject to dividend restrictions set forth in California state banking law and administered by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation ("DFPI"). Under such restrictions, the Bank may not pay cash dividends in an amount which exceeds the lesser of the retained earnings of the Bank or the Bank’s net income for the last three fiscal years (less the amount of distributions to shareholders during that period of time). If the above test is not met, cash dividends may only be paid with the prior approval of the DFPI, in an amount not exceeding the Bank’s net income for its last fiscal year or the amount of its net income for the current fiscal year. Such restrictions do not apply to stock dividends, which generally require neither the satisfaction of any tests nor the approval of the DFPI. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the DFPI finds that the shareholders’ equity is not adequate or that the declarations of a dividend would be unsafe or unsound, the DFPI may prevent the bank from paying a dividend. The FRB may also limit dividends paid by the Bank.
Reserve Balances
The Bank is required to maintain average reserve balances with the Federal Reserve Bank. At December 31, 2020, the Bank was not subject to a reserve requirement.
