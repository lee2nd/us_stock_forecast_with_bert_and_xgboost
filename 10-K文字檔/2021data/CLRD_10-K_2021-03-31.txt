ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes many forward-looking statements. For cautions about relying on such forward looking statements, please refer to the section entitled “Forward Looking Statements” at the beginning of this Report immediately prior to Item 1.
General
We were a leading company in developing and commercializing high temperature superconductor (“HTS”) materials and related technologies. HTS materials can substantially improve the performance characteristics of electrical systems, reducing power loss, lowering heat generation, and decreasing electrical noise. We currently are seeking to negotiate and consummate a merger with Allied Integral United, Inc. (d/b/a Clearday). If we fail to promptly negotiate and consummate such a merger, there is a high chance we will file for bankruptcy protection.
Results of Operations
Compared to 2019
Total revenues decreased by $361,000 or 66%, to $184,000 in 2020 from $545,000 in 2019. Government contract revenues were $174,000 or 95% of total revenue, of our total revenue in 2020 and $540,000 or 99% of total revenues in 2019.
Cost of commercial product revenues includes all direct costs, manufacturing overhead, preproduction process development and provision for excess and obsolete inventories. The cost of commercial product revenues totaled $190,000 for 2020 compared to $3.3 million in 2019. Cost of government product revenues totaled $71,000 for 2020 compared to $303,000 in 2019.
Our cost of commercial product revenues includes both variable and fixed cost components. The variable component consists primarily of materials, assembly and test labor, overhead, which includes equipment and facility depreciation, transportation costs and warranty costs. The fixed component includes test equipment and facility depreciation, purchasing and procurement expenses and quality assurance costs. Given the fixed nature of such costs, the absorption of our production overhead costs into inventory decreases and the amount of production overhead variances charged to cost of sales increases as production volumes decline since we have fewer units to absorb our overhead costs against. Conversely, the absorption of our production overhead costs into inventory increases and the amount of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales decreases as production volumes increase since we have more units to absorb our overhead costs against. As a result, our gross profit margins generally decrease as revenue and production volumes decline due to lower sales volume and higher amounts of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales; and our gross profit margins generally increase as our revenue and production volumes increase due to higher sales volume and lower amounts of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales.
The following is an analysis of our product gross profit margins for 2020 and 2019:
We had a gross loss of $180,000 in 2020 from the sale of our commercial products compared to a gross loss of $3.3 million in 2019. We experienced a gross loss in 2020 and 2019 due to: our manufacturing efforts to bring our Conductus wire production to market; our processes not yet being finalized for high yield manufacturing and; our sales being insufficient to cover our overhead. We were not able to improve our manufacturing processes and increase our yields and have ceased our Conductus wire manufacturing in the first quarter of 2020.
Our 2020 government contract revenues were $174,000 and cost of government contract revenues, which include all direct contract costs and overhead, were $71,000. Since we ceased manufacturing of our Conductus wire, we also concluded our efforts on this contract.
Research and development expenses related to development of new wire products and new wire product manufacturing processes. As such, our research and development efforts concluded in the first quarter of 2020. Research and development expenses totaled $178,000 in 2020 compared to $2.4 million in 2019.
Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $2.7 million in 2020 compared to $3.9 million in 2019, a decrease of $1.2 million, or 31%. The lower expenses in 2020 were primarily the result of reduced operations as we pursue a merger with Clearday.
Other income of $2,000 and $59,000 in 2020 and 2019, respectively, was interest income.
Net loss totaled $3.0 million in 2020, compared to $9.2 million in 2019, a decrease of $6.2 million, or 68%. The decrease in net loss principally resulted from ceased Conductus wire operations.
The net loss available to common stockholders totaled $1.10 per common share in 2020, compared to a net loss of $12.33 per common share in 2019, a decrease of $11.23, or 91%. The decreased loss per common share in 2020 resulted from a greater number of common shares outstanding at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 and ceased Conductus wire operations.
Compared to 2018
Total revenues decreased by $1,011,000 or 65%, to $545,000 in 2019 from $1,556,000 in 2018. Government contract revenues were $540,000 or 99% of total revenue, of our total revenue in 2019 and $1,556,000 or 100% of total revenues in 2018.
Cost of commercial product revenues includes all direct costs, manufacturing overhead, preproduction process development and provision for excess and obsolete inventories. The cost of commercial product revenues totaled $3.3 million for 2019 compared to $2.2 million in 2018. Cost of government product revenues totaled $0.3 million for 2019 compared to $1.2 million in 2018.
Our cost of commercial product revenues includes both variable and fixed cost components. The variable component consists primarily of materials, assembly and test labor, overhead, which includes equipment and facility depreciation, transportation costs and warranty costs. The fixed component includes test equipment and facility depreciation, purchasing and procurement expenses and quality assurance costs. Given the fixed nature of such costs, the absorption of our production overhead costs into inventory decreases and the amount of production overhead variances charged to cost of sales increases as production volumes decline since we have fewer units to absorb our overhead costs against. Conversely, the absorption of our production overhead costs into inventory increases and the amount of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales decreases as production volumes increase since we have more units to absorb our overhead costs against. As a result, our gross profit margins generally decrease as revenue and production volumes decline due to lower sales volume and higher amounts of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales; and our gross profit margins generally increase as our revenue and production volumes increase due to higher sales volume and lower amounts of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales.
The following is an analysis of our product gross profit margins for 2019 and 2018:
We had a gross loss of $3.3 million in 2019 from the sale of our commercial products compared to a gross loss of $2.2 million in 2018. We experienced a gross loss in 2019 and 2018 due to: our increased manufacturing efforts to bring our Conductus wire production to market; our processes not yet being finalized for high yield manufacturing and; our sales being insufficient to cover our overhead. We have not been able to improve our manufacturing processes and increasing our yields at lower than optimal capacity and have now ceased our Conductus wire manufacturing.
In June 2017, we finalized negotiations on a $4.5 million DOE contract and have begun work on this government contract. Our first year goals under this contract are to increase current carrying capacity and reduce costs of our Conductus wire. Our 2019 government contract revenues were $545,000 and cost of government contract revenues, which include all direct contract costs and overhead, were $303,000. Since we have ceased manufacturing of our Conductus wire, we have now concluded our efforts on this contract.
Research and development expenses relate to development of new wire products and new wire product manufacturing processes. In 2017, we ceased research and development efforts for our wireless commercial products. Research and development expenses totaled $2.4 million in 2019 compared to $2.4 million in 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $3.9 million in 2019 compared to $4.0 million in 2018, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 3%. The lower expenses in 2019 were primarily the result cost reductions.
Other income of $59,000 and $64,000 in 2019 and 2018, respectively, was interest income.
Net loss totaled $9.2 million in 2019, compared to $8.1 million in 2018, an increase of $1.1 million, or 14%. The increase in net loss principally resulted from $1.0 million lower 2019 government revenues.
The net loss available to common stockholders totaled $12.33 per common share in 2019, compared to a net loss of $40.32 per common share in 2018, a decrease of $27.99, or 69%. The decreased loss per common share in 2019 principally resulted from a greater number of common shares outstanding at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flow Analysis
As of December 31, 2020, we had net working capital of $1.1 million, including $1.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to net working capital of $429,000 at December 31, 2019, which included $713,000 in cash and cash equivalents. We currently invest our excess cash in short-term, investment-grade, money-market instruments with maturities of three months or less. Our investments have no exposure to the auction rate securities market.
Cash and cash equivalents increased by $563,000 from $713,000 at December 31, 2019 to $1,276,000 at December 31, 2020. In 2020, $3.1 million cash was used in operations, while $3.7 million was provided by financing and investing activities.
In 2020, net cash provided by investing activities was $1.2 million from the sale of patents, property and equipment related to our ceased Conductus wire operations. There were no investing activities in 2019.
In 2020, $2.5 million was provided by the sale of warrants issued as part of our October 2019 offering.
In 2019, net cash provided by two financing activities: (1) the May 2019 offering of our common stock, provided gross proceeds of $1.7 million and, after deducting the placement agent fees and our offering expenses, net proceeds of $1.4 million; (2) the October 2019 offering of our common stock and warrants provided gross proceeds of $3.0 million and, after deducting the placement agent fees and our offering expenses, net proceeds of $2.4 million.
Financing Activities
We have historically financed our operations through a combination of cash on hand, equipment lease financings, available borrowings under bank lines of credit and both private and public equity offerings. We made no offerings in 2020, however, $2.5 million was provided by the sale of warrants issued as part of our October 2019 offering mentioned below.
On October 10, 2019 we completed a public offering of an aggregate of 1,183,400 shares of our common stock (or common stock equivalents) and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,183,400 shares of common stock with gross proceeds to us of approximately $3.0 million. The warrants are exercisable for five years at an exercise price equal to the public offering price. The offering was priced at $2.50 per share of common stock. The net proceeds to us from the offering, after deducting the placement agent fees and our estimated offering expenses, was approximately $2.4 million. The placement agent received warrants to purchase 82,838 shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $3.125. In 2020, 978,594 of these warrants were exercised, providing us with proceeds of $2.5 million. Our current forecast is that our existing cash and cash equivalents resources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations into the third quarter of 2021(See “Future Liquidity” below).
On May 23, 2019 we completed a public offering of an aggregate of 170,000 shares of our common stock with gross proceeds to us of $1.7 million. The net proceeds to us from the offering, after deducting the placement agent fees and our estimated offering expenses, was $1.4 million.
On July 30, 2018 we completed a public offering of an aggregate of 257,142 shares of our common stock (or common stock equivalents) and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 257,142 shares of common stock with gross proceeds to us of $9.0 million. The net proceeds to us from the offering, after deducting the placement agent fees and our estimated offering expenses, was $7.98 million.
On March 9, 2018, we completed a registered offering of common stock (and common stock equivalents) with total gross proceeds of approximately $2 million. The net proceeds to us from the registered offering, after deducting the placement agent fees and our estimated offering expenses, was approximately $1.7 million.
We currently intend to use the net proceeds of these offerings for working capital and general corporate purposes. In addition, we may use a portion of any net proceeds to acquire complementary products, technologies, or businesses.
Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments
We have historically incurred various contractual obligations and commercial commitments in our normal course of business. They consisted of the following:
Operating Lease Obligations. Our operating lease obligations consisted of a facility lease in Austin, Texas, as well as several smaller equipment leases.
Patents and Licenses. We entered into a licensing agreement requiring royalty payments ranging from 0.5% to 1.0% of specified product sales. The agreement contains a provision for the payment of guaranteed or minimum royalty amounts. Typically, the licensor can terminate our license if we fail to pay minimum annual royalties.
Purchase Commitments. In the normal course of business, we incur purchase obligations with vendors and suppliers for the purchase of inventory, as well as other goods and services. These obligations are generally evidenced by purchase orders that contain the terms and conditions associated with the purchase arrangements. We are committed to accept delivery of such material pursuant to the purchase orders subject to various contract provisions that allow us to delay receipt of such orders or cancel orders beyond certain agreed upon lead times. Cancellations may result in cancellation costs payable by us.
We have no minimum lease payments under operating leases and license obligations going forward.
Capital Expenditures
We do not plan to invest in fixed assets during 2021.
Future Liquidity
In 2020, we incurred a net loss of $3 million and had negative cash flows from operations of $3.1 million. In 2019, we incurred a net loss of $9.2 million and had negative cash flows from operations of $8.8 million. At December 31, 2020 we had $1.3 million in cash.
Clearday made a good faith payment to us of $120,000 in early February, 2021, which is non-refundable, to assist with our operating expenses as we negotiate a new merger agreement.
On February 26, 2021, we entered into an unsecured note evidencing our loan under the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP Loan”) in the principal amount of approximately $0.5 million. Proceeds of our PPP Loan may be used for payroll costs, costs related to certain group health care benefits, rent payments, utility payments, mortgage interest payments, interest payments on other debt obligations. Our current plans are to seek partial loan forgiveness in the amount of approximately $150,000, as permitted under the PPP Loan, and to repay the remainder.
Our cash resources are not sufficient to fund our business through the end of the current fiscal year, however, we believe they are sufficient to fund our operations through approximately August 2021, during which time we intend to pursue merger negotiations and, if they are successful, shareholder approval for a merger with Clearday. There is no assurance that these negotiations will be successful or that shareholder approval will be obtained, in which case we likely will need to seek bankruptcy protection.
Our independent registered public accounting firm has included in their audit reports for 2019 through 2020 an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Net Operating Loss Carryforward
As of December 31, 2020, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $297.9 million which expire in the years 2021 through 2038. Of these amounts, $50.8 million resulted from the acquisition of Conductus. We also had $15.6 million of Federal net operating losses from the 2018 and 2019 tax year which do not expire, but are subject to an annual limitation under section 382 as discussed below. Under the Internal Revenue Code change of control limitations, a maximum of $14.2 million will be available for reduction of future taxable income.
Due to the uncertainty surrounding their realization, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. Accordingly, no deferred tax asset has been recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes an annual limitation on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards based on a statutory rate of return (usually the “applicable federal funds rate”, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) and the value of the corporation at the time of a “change of ownership” as defined by Section 382. We had changes in ownership in August 1999, December 2002, June 2009, August 2013, December 2016 and May 2019. In addition, we acquired the right to Conductus’ net operating losses, which are also subject to the limitations imposed by Section 382. Conductus underwent seven ownership changes, for purpose of this rule, which occurred in February 1999, February 2001, December 2002, June 2009, August 2013, December 2016 and May 2019. Therefore, our net operating loss carryforwards of $285.9 million which were incurred prior to the 2019 ownership changes, will be subject in future periods to annual limitations of $115,000. Net operating losses released from this limitation and/or incurred by us subsequent to the ownership changes and therefore not subject to this limitation totaled $12.2 million. An additional $115,000 in losses were released from limitation during the year under Section 382.
Market Risk
We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculation purposes. Our money market investments have no exposure to the auction rate securities market.
At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1 million invested in a money market account yielding approximately 0.1%. Assuming no yield on this money market account and no liquidation of principal for the year, our total interest income would decrease by less than $1,000 per annum.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, recovery of long-lived assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, contract revenue and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
On July 24, 2018, we effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of our common stock, or the 2018 Reverse Stock Split. As a result of the 2018 Reverse Stock Split, every ten shares of our pre-2018 Reverse Stock Split common stock were combined and reclassified into one share of our common stock. The 2018 Reverse Stock Split did not change the authorized number of shares or the par value of our common stock.
On September 9, 2020, we effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of our common stock, or the 2020 Reverse Stock Split. As a result of the 2020 Reverse Stock Split, every ten shares of our pre-2020 Reverse Stock Split common stock were combined and reclassified into one share of our common stock. The 2020 Reverse Stock Split changed the authorized number of shares from 250,000,000 to 25,000,000. The par value of our common stock remained $0.001. Share and per share data included in this Item 7 have been retroactively adjusted, as applicable, for the effect of the reverse stock splits. Certain of the information contained in the documents incorporated by reference herein and therein present information on our common stock on a pre-reverse stock split basis.
We identified certain critical accounting policies which affect certain of our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2019. We have not made any material changes to these policies.
We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. We write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
Our inventory is valued at the lower of its actual cost or net realizable value of the inventory. We review inventory quantities on hand and on order and record, on a quarterly basis, a provision for excess and obsolete inventory and/or vendor cancellation charges related to purchase commitments. If the results of the review determine that a write-down is necessary, we recognize a loss in the period in which the loss is identified, whether or not the inventory is retained. Our inventory reserves establish a new cost basis for inventory and are not reversed until we sell or dispose of the related inventory. Such provisions are established based on historical usage, adjusted for known changes in demands for such products, or the estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements. We recognize all manufacturing preproduction process development expenses as cost of revenues in the period they are incurred. Our business is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly. Our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, and we may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory.
Commercial product revenues consist of revenue from sales of products, net of trade discounts and allowances. We recognize revenue when evidence of an arrangement exists, contractual obligations have been satisfied, title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. At the time revenue is recognized, we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties if allowed for under contractual arrangements and return products. Our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should such failure rates or costs differ from these estimates, accrued warranty costs would be adjusted.
We indemnify, without limit or term, our customers against all claims, suits, demands, damages, liabilities, expenses, judgments, settlements and penalties arising from actual or alleged infringement or misappropriation of any intellectual property relating to our products or other claims arising from our products. We have no known losses and we cannot reasonably develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of payments that might be made under our indemnities because of the uncertainty as to whether a claim might arise and how much it might total.
Government contract revenues are principally generated under research and development contracts. Contract revenues are derived primarily from research contracts with agencies of the United States Government. Credit risk related to accounts receivable arising from such contracts is considered minimal. These contracts may include cost-plus, fixed price and cost sharing arrangements and are generally short-term in nature.
All payments to us for work performed on contracts with agencies of the U.S. Government are subject to adjustment upon audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. Based on historical experience and review of current projects in process, we believe that the audits will not have a significant effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Defense Contract Audit Agency has audited us through 2018.
We periodically evaluate the realizability of long-lived assets as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover the carrying amount. Long-lived assets that will no longer be used in our business are written off in the period identified since they will no longer generate any positive cash flows for us. Such evaluation is based on various analyses, including cash flow and profitability projections, as well as alternative uses, such as government contracts or awards. The analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment. In the event the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than net book value of the assets, the carrying value of the assets will be written down to their estimated fair value. Our future cash flows may vary from estimates.
The fair value of our warrant liabilities was determined using the binomial lattice valuation model, including an equal probabilities tree and an early exercise factor. These derivative liabilities were adjusted to reflect fair value at each period end, with any increase or decrease in the fair value recognized in our consolidated statement of operations. These warrants expired on August 9, 2018 and had no value after such date.
Stock-based employee compensation cost is recognized using the fair-value based method for all awards granted. We issue stock option awards and restricted share awards to employees and to non-employee directors under our stock-based incentive plans. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Compensation cost related to restricted share awards is recorded based on the market price of our common stock on the grant date. We recognize compensation expense over the expected service period, generally the vesting period on a straight-line basis from the grant date.
Our valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets is based on our assessments of historical losses and projected operating results in future periods. If and when we generate future taxable income in the U.S. against which these tax assets may be applied, some portion or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed and an increase in net income would consequently be reported in future years.
