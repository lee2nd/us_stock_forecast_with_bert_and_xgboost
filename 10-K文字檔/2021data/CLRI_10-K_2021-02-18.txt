Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ TOGETHER WITH THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.
Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak
The ongoing COVID-19 global and national health emergency has caused significant disruption in the international and United States economies and financial markets. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. The spread of COVID-19 has caused illness, quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in business activity and financial transactions, labor shortages, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability. The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to significantly impact the Company's supply chain and other service providers.
In addition, a severe prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to the business, including weakened demand for products and services and a decreased ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. As the situation continues to evolve, the Company will continue to closely monitor market conditions and respond accordingly. To date, the Company has not experienced a significant adverse economic impact due to COVID-19. While travel and other restrictions have been imposed the company has mitigated the situation by teleconferencing, web demos, etc. However, there is no assurance that we will not have any adverse impact in the future.
The following discussion reflects the Company's plan of operation. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements which are attached to this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expected financial position, business and financing plans. These statements involve risks and uncertainties. The actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly under the headings "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."
