FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements contained herein constitute “forward-looking statements”. Except for the historical information contained herein, this report contains forward-looking statements (identified by the words “estimate,” “project,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “expect,” “intend,” “believe,” “hope,” “strategy” and similar expressions), which are based on our current expectations and speak only as of the date made. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those discussed under Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report, and those described herein that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements, and the following:
● Our limited operating history with our business model;
● The low cash balance and limited financing currently available to us. We may in the near future have a number of obligations that we will be unable to meet without generating additional income or raising additional capital;
● Further cost reductions or curtailment in future operations due to our low cash balance and negative cash flow;
● Our ability to effect a financing transaction to fund our operations which could adversely affect the value of our stock;
● Our limited cash resources may not be sufficient to fund continuing losses from operations;
● The failure of our products and services to achieve market acceptance; and
● The inability to compete in our market, especially against established industry competitors with greater market presence and financial resources.
The following discussion and analysis provides information that our management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes that appear elsewhere in this report.
Overview
The Company develops, markets and distributes various self-serve electronic kiosks and mall/airport co-branded islands throughout North America. The Company seeks to place its kiosks in high-traffic host locations such as big box stores, restaurants, malls, airports, casinos, universities, and colleges. At the current time, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our business model has been disrupted because of the closure of heavily trafficked and major retail locations. Management is evaluating all business opportunities.
Prior to December 31, 2018, the Company had an active license and sponsorship agreement in place with the National Hockey League. The Company never produced product under the license. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company and NHL agreed to terminate the NHL Agreement. In return, the Company agreed to pay the NHL an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the Company’s net sales of certain products as defined under the agreement.
In June 2016, the Company entered into a license agreement beginning January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018 with Major League Baseball Properties, Inc. (“MLB”, “Licensor”) for the non-exclusive right to certain proprietary intangible property of the Licensor to be used in connection with the manufacturing, distribution, promotion and advertisement of an ice cream novelty product to be sold within the U.S., the District of Columbia and U.S. territories.
In 2017, the Company modified its agreement with Major League Baseball Properties to extend through calendar year 2019. Additionally, the Company has a revenue sharing agreement with MLB on screen advertising at Point-of- sale. The Company received an initial purchase order for pallets of MLB ice cream in May 2018 and shipped this product in June. The Company planned to sell pallets of MLB ice cream to large national wholesale distributors as well as through reach-in MLB branded freezers which include a digital advertising screen.
On March 18, 2019, the Company approved of an asset sale of the assets related to the legacy MiniMelts brand for $350,000 in cash, which was approved by a majority of stockholders. Part of the proceeds from the sale was used to retire certain lease obligations as well as for general operating purposes. The Company will continue to explore opportunities in the frozen business, seeking to leverage its vending assets to pursue new revenue streams and test concepts for new offerings at retail, including health and wellness. The Board of Directors had agreed to begin to explore the development of certain products in the cannabis industry with a focus on non-THC Cannabinoids in frozen desserts as well as other complimentary CBD product offerings though vending as well as online sales and direct to retail, under a new brand. Due to the global pandemic and the closure and reduction of heavily trafficked business, management is reevaluating all business partnerships and opportunities.

Gain on Fair Value of Debt and Warrant Liabilities
Certain warrants issued by the Company have a “down round provision”. As such, the warrants have been recorded as liabilities and are subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date. The warrants are valued using the Black Scholes method and will continue to be adjusted each reporting period for changes in fair value until the warrant is exercised or expires. Gains or losses on revaluation are recorded as a component of other expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized a gain on the change in fair value of debt and warrant liabilities in the amount $34,986, as compared to $62,097 during the year ended December 31, 2018.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Company had net loss of $1,896,150 during the year ended December 31, 2019, has accumulated losses totaling $14,198,142, and has a working capital deficit of $6,876,803 at December 31, 2019. These factors, among others, indicate that the Company may be unable to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.
The Company will need to raise additional financing in order to fund the its operations for the next 12 months, and to allow the Company to continue the development of its business plans and satisfy its obligations on a timely basis. Should additional financing not be available, the Company will have to negotiate with its lenders to extend the repayment dates of its indebtedness. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully restructure its debt obligations in the event it fails to obtain additional financing.
Operating Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company used $751,367 of cash in operating activities primarily as a result of the Company’s net loss of $1,896,150, offset by gain on change in fair value of debt and warrant liabilities of $34,986, loss on sale of asset of $27,465, loss on asset impairment of $192,705, share-based compensation of $285,379, $100,188 in depreciation expense, $171,513 in amortization and accretion of debt discount, loss on default of convertible notes of $42,625, gain of settlement of debt $156,709 and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $516,333.

The Company used $296,508 in repayments of promissory notes, $64,300 in repayment of convertible notes, and $189,936 in repayments of capital lease obligations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, an effect on its financial condition, financial statements, revenues or expenses.
Inflation
Although the Company’s operations are influenced by general economic conditions, it does not believe that inflation had a material effect on its results of operations during the last two years as it is generally able to pass the increase in material and labor costs to its customers or absorb them as it improves the efficiency of its operations.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2019 describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates and be based on events different from those assumptions. Future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty; estimating therefore, requires the exercise of judgment. Thus, accounting estimates change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired or as additional information is obtained. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
For certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and short-term debt, the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. ASC Topic 825, “Financial Instruments,” defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:
● Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. The Company considers active markets as those in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis
● Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. This category includes those derivative instruments that the Company values using observable market data. Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the term of the derivative instruments, can be derived from observable data, or supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
● Level 3: Measured based on prices or valuation models that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and less observable from objective sources (i.e. supported by little or no market activity). Level 3 instruments include derivative warrant instruments. The Company does not have sufficient corroborating evidence to support classifying these assets and liabilities as Level 1 or Level 2.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. Certain warrants issued by the Company contain terms that result in the warrants being classified as derivative liabilities for accounting purposes. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair market value and then is revalued at each reporting date, with changes in fair value reported in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency risks.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases”, which requires that lease arrangements longer than 12 months result in an entity recognizing an asset and liability. ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. The Company has adopted ASU 2016-02 and determined that its adoption had no impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
