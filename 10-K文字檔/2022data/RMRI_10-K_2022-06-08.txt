Overview
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada in August 2012 under the name “Online Yearbook” with the principal business objective of developing and marketing online yearbooks for schools, companies and government agencies.
In November 2014, Rocky Mountain Resource Holdings, Inc. (“RMRH”) became our majority shareholder by acquiring 5,200,000 shares of our common stock (the “Shares”), or 69.06% of the then issued and outstanding shares, pursuant to stock purchase agreements with Messrs. El Maraana and Salah Blal, our former officers and directors. The Shares were acquired for an aggregate purchase price of $357,670.
In December 2014, we changed our name to “RMR Industrials, Inc.” and on January 1, 2020, the Company changed its name from RMR Industrials, Inc. to Rocky Mountain Industrials, Inc.
In July 2016, we formed RMR Aggregates, Inc., a Colorado corporation (“RMR Aggregates”), as our wholly-owned subsidiary. RMR Aggregates was formed to hold assets whose primary focus is the mining and processing of industrial minerals for the manufacturing, construction and agriculture sectors. These minerals include limestone, aggregates, marble, silica, barite and sand.
In October 2016, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement with CalX Minerals, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (“CalX”), RMR Aggregates completed the purchase of substantially all of the assets associated with the Mid-Continent Quarry on 41 BLM unpatented placer mining claims in Garfield County, Colorado. CalX assets include the mining claims, improvements, access rights, water rights, equipment, inventory, contracts, permits, certain intellectual property rights, and other tangible and intangible assets associated with the limestone mining operation.
In January 2018, the Company formed Rail Land Company, LLC (“Rail Land Company”) as a wholly-owned subsidiary to acquire and develop a rail terminal and services facility (the “Rail Park”). Rail Land Company purchased an approximately 470-acre parcel of real property located in Bennett, Colorado in February, 2018. In July 2018 we exercised our option to acquire an additional approximately 150 acres for a total of approximately 620 acres. The Company’s development of the Rail Park is intended to expand the customer base for our products by utilizing rail freight capabilities to reach customers in the greater Denver area and by expanding our business to include rail transportation solutions and services.
On April 26, 2019, RMR Logistics entered into an asset purchase agreement with H2K, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (“the Seller”) pursuant to which RMR Logistics acquired the Seller’s trucking assets.
Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. Management considers many factors in selecting appropriate financial accounting policies and controls, and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements. Management must apply significant judgment in this process. In addition, other factors may affect estimates, including: expected business and operational changes, sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates, and whether historical trends are expected to be representative of future trends. The estimation process may yield a range of potentially reasonable estimates of the ultimate future outcomes and management must select an amount that falls within that range of reasonable estimates. Although these estimates are based on the Company’s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately materially differ from those estimated amounts and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements.
Segment Reporting
Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision-maker in making decisions regarding resource allocation and
assessing performance. As of March 31, 2022, the Company views its operations and manages its business as two operating segments, Aggregates and Rail Park.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. As of March 31, 2022, the Company had cash of approximately $3,238,000 and no cash equivalents. The Company may occasionally maintain cash balances in excess of amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The amounts are held with major financial institutions and are monitored by management to mitigate credit risk.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Asset impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset. Any impairment losses are measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows and are charged to income on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. The Company’s estimates of future cash flows are based on numerous assumptions, including expected commodity prices, production levels, capital requirements and estimated salvage values. It is possible that actual future cash flows will be significantly different than the estimates, as actual future quantities of recoverable material, future commodity prices, production levels and costs and capital are each subject to significant risks and uncertainties. As of March 31, 2022, the Company’s mineral resources do not meet the definition of proven or probable reserves or value beyond proven or probable reserves and any potential revenue has been excluded from the cash flow assumptions. Accordingly, recoverability of the long-lived assets’ capitalized cost is based primarily on estimated salvage values or alternative future uses.
Accrued Reclamation Liability
The Company incurs reclamation liabilities as part of its mining activities. Quarry activities require the removal and relocation of significant levels of overburden to access materials of usable quantity and quality. The same overburden material is used to reclaim depleted mine areas, which must be sloped to a certain gradient and seeded to prevent erosion in the future. Reclamation methods and requirements can differ depending on the quarry and state rules and regulations in existence for certain locations. As of March 31, 2022, the Company’s undiscounted reclamation obligations totaled approximately $366,000, which is expected to be settled within the next 20 years.
Reclamation costs resulting from the normal use of long-lived assets, either owned or leased, are recognized over the period the asset is in use. The obligation, which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting cash flows, is recorded at fair value as a liability at the obligating event date and is accreted through charges to operating expenses. The fair value is based on our estimate for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation tasks including a reasonable profit margin. This fair value is also capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset.
The mining reclamation reserve is based on management’s estimate of future cost requirements to reclaim property at its operating quarry site. Costs are estimated in current dollars and inflated until the expected time of payment using a future estimated inflation rate and then discounted back to present value using a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate on obligations of similar maturity adjusted to reflect our credit rating. The Company will review reclamation liabilities at least every three years for a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Additionally, reclamation liabilities are reviewed in the period that a triggering event occurs that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment to an existing mineral lease. Examples of events that would cause a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or early or delayed closure of a site. Any affect to earnings from cost revisions is included in cost of revenue.
Net Loss per Common Share
Basic net loss per common share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders, after deducting preferred dividends, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, without consideration of the potentially dilutive effects of converting stock options or restricted stock purchase rights outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and the potential dilutive effects of stock options or restricted stock purchase rights outstanding during the period determined using the treasury stock method. In periods in which the Company reports a net loss attributable to common stockholders, diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders since dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued, as their effect is anti-dilutive.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires, among other things, that deferred income taxes be provided for temporary differences between the tax bases of the Company’s assets and liabilities and their financial statement reported amounts. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
A valuation allowance is recorded by the Company when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such a determination, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance. When the Company establishes or reduces the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets, its provision for income taxes will increase or decrease, respectively, in the period such determination is made.
Additionally, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the financial statements for a particular tax position is based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. Accordingly, the Company establishes reserves for uncertain tax positions. The Company has not recognized interest or penalties in its statement of operations and comprehensive loss since inception.

Results of Operations for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2022 compared to the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2021
Revenues
Revenues for the year ended March 31, 2022 were $2,777,950, compared to revenues of $680,225 for the same period in the year ended March 31, 2021. The increase in revenues from the prior year is primary the result of a supply contract for construction aggregates in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold for the year ended March 31, 2022, was $2,371,109, compared to $699,087 for the year ended March 31, 2021. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily the result of the supply contract noted above.
Selling, general and administrative
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2022 were $11,650,453, compared to selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2021 of $12,132,761. Selling, general and administrative expenses consisted of corporate overhead costs related to payroll and associated benefits, consulting services from related parties, public company costs and depreciation and amortization. The decrease is primarily related to the Company managing selling, general and administrative costs as we continue to operate in a development stage.
Interest expense, net
Interest expense, net decreased as a result of a decrease in average outstanding debt balance during the year.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of March 31, 2022, we had current assets of $6,608,667, total current liabilities of $4,103,971 and working capital of $2,504,696. We have incurred an accumulated loss of $63,810,756 since inception.
In past years, the Company funded operations by using cash proceeds received through the issuance of common and preferred stock and proceeds from debt financing. However, several significant transactions have occurred over the last 18 months that have positively impacted the net financial position of the Company and strengthened its financial position and its ability to meet future obligation over the next 12 months without a need to raise additional funds as it has traditionally been required to do. These include:
1. Rail Park FDP and Final Plat were unanimously approved by the Adams County Board of County Commissioners on September 1, 2020, paving the way for lot sales and construction.
2. On January 14, 2021, the Company sold an 83-acre lot to a Fortune 500 company for a gross sales price of $9.1M. This purchase was the first of twelve available lots in the Rail Park. Lot sales will be a primary source of cash inflows for the Company with significant interest from many potential light and heavy industrial tenants.
3. The RMRP Metro District bond offering closed on April 15, 2021, raising total proceeds of approximately $65.2M. These bond proceeds will fund the public infrastructure costs of the Rail Park. Total Rail Park project costs have been budgeted at between $60M and $75M of which approximately 75% is considered public infrastructure and therefore not an obligation of the Company. The Company is responsible for the remaining approximately 25%.
4. Construction on the south parcels of the Rail Park (approximately 150 acres) began in April 2021. The Company has in place a construction loan facility of $12M to fund it portion of construction costs (i.e., those not funded with Metro District bond proceeds).
6. In September 2021, the Company sold its water rights underlying the Rail Park, to the Metro District for approximately $5.9M.
7. In May 2022, the Company closed on a construction loan facility of $21M and a working capital facility of $2M to provide for its developer portion of the infrastructure costs of the Rail Park.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
None.
