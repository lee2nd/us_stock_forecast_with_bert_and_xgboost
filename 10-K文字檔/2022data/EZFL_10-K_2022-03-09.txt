Overview
We were incorporated under the laws of Delaware in March 2019. We are in the business of operating mobile fueling trucks and are headquartered in Miami, Florida. EzFill provides its customers the ability to have fuel delivered to their vehicles (cars, boats, trucks) without leaving their home or office and to construction sites, generators and reserve tanks.
Our mobile fueling solution gives our fleet, consumer and other customers the ability to fuel their vehicles with the touch of an app or regularly scheduled service, and without the inconvenience of going to the gas station.
Our consumer business was impacted significantly in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic and has largely returned in 2021 for residential fueling but is still in the process of recovering at office parks to pre-pandemic levels as employees gradually return to the office.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or GAAP. We have identified certain accounting policies as critical to understanding our financial condition and results of our operations. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see the notes to our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Results of Operations
The following table sets forth our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which we use in our financial performance analyses. This measure should not be considered a substitute for GAAP-basis measures, nor should it be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of net interest expense, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and stock compensation expense, provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of our financial results. Non-GAAP measures are not formally defined by GAAP, and other entities may use calculation methods that differ from ours for the purposes of calculating Adjusted EBITDA. As a complement to GAAP financial measures, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA assists investors who follow the practice of some investment analysts who adjust GAAP financial measures to exclude items that may obscure underlying performance and distort comparability.
The following is a reconciliation of net loss to the non-GAAP financial measure referred to as Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2020
Revenues
We generated revenues of $7,233,957 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $3,586,244 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of 3,647,713 or 102%. This increase is due to a 53% increase in gallons delivered as well as an increase in the average price per gallon.
Cost of sales was $7,027,274 for the year ended December 31, 2021, resulting in a gross profit of $206,683, compared to $42,172 for the prior year. The $3,483,202 or 98% increase in cost of sales is due to the increase in sales.
Operating Expenses
We incurred operating expenses of $8,102,934 during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $6,523,307 during the prior year, an increase of $1,579,627 or 24%. This net increase consisted of a decrease of $2,728,634 in stock compensation expense and an increase of $4,308,261 in other operating expenses. The increase was primarily due to increases in payroll, sales and marketing, insurance, technology and public company expenses.
Depreciation and Amortization
Amortization increased in the current year as a result of the acquisition of a technology license. Depreciation increased in the current year as a result of purchases of vehicles and delivery equipment.
Other Income (Expense)
Other income in the current year resulted from the forgiveness of a loan under the Paycheck Protection Program. Interest expense increased due to warrants and shares issued in connection with new debt as well as the early repayment of debt and the resulting write-off of unamortized debt discounts.
Net Losses
We sustained a net loss of $9,383,397 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $7,254,006 for the prior year, an increase of $2,129,391 or 29% as a result of the above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flow Activities
As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $(17,339,396). We have incurred net losses since inception and have funded operations primarily through sales of our common stock and issuance of notes payable, including to related parties. As of December 31, 2021, we had $16,924,146 in cash and investments, as compared to December 31, 2020, when we had $882,870 in cash.
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $(6,306,759) for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was made up primarily by the net loss and partially offset by an increase in stock-based compensation of $1,896,074, warrants and shares to lenders of $248,011, and depreciation and amortization of $872,834. Net cash used in operating activities was $(1,607,669) during the prior year, which was made up primarily by the net loss and partially offset by depreciation and amortization of $451,533, stock-based compensation of $4,624,708, and loss on settlement of $300,000.
Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we used $1,998,151 and $24,075, respectively, for the acquisition of fixed assets. We invested $3,367,953 in debt securities in 2021. We also used a total of $1,998,151 in 2021 for trucks delivered in 2021 as well as those being built for delivery in 2022.
Financing Activities
We generated $24,370,464 of cash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021, including $28,750,000 less related expense of $(3,500,426) from the Initial Public Offering, $2,990,572 from new debt borrowings and $115,000 from issuance of stock, less $3,984,682 for the repayment of debt. All of the pre-acquisition debt was repaid following our IPO. Approximately $317,000 of new debt in 2021 was incurred post-IPO for the purchase of trucks and other vehicles. During the same period of the prior year, we generated $2,482,523 from financing activities, $1,174,673 from new debt and $1,550,000 from the sale of shares, less $242,150 for the repayment of debt.
Liquidity and Sources of Capital
From inception to December 31, 2021, we have funded our activities through capital contributions from issuances of notes payable and the sale of securities pursuant to the exemption provided by Regulation D, by sale of securities to accredited investors and a public offering. We have also financed truck purchases from manufacturer loans and from our bank line of credit.
The Company has sustained a net loss since inception and does not have sufficient revenues and income to fully fund the operations. As a result, the Company has relied on loans from stockholders and others as well as stock sales to fund its activities to date. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had a net loss of $9,383,387. At December 31, 2021, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $17,339,396 and a working capital surplus of $16,436,296. We anticipate that we will continue to generate operating losses and use cash in operations through the foreseeable future.
In September 2021, the Company completed its Initial Public Offering and raised $25,250,000 in net proceeds after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses. The Company expects that its cash on hand will fund its operations for at least 12 months after the issuance date of these financial statements. However, since inception, the Company’s operations have primarily been funded through proceeds received in equity and debt financings. The Company anticipates that it will need to raise additional capital in order to fund its operations. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain funds on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. There is also no assurance that the amount of funds the Company might raise will enable the Company to complete its initiatives or attain profitable operations. The Company’s operating needs include the planned costs to operate its business, including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures. The Company’s future capital requirements and the adequacy of its available funds will depend on many factors, including the Company’s ability to successfully expand to new markets, competition, and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies to enhance or complement its product and service offerings. There can be no assurances that, in the event that we require additional financing, such financing will be available on terms which are favorable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funding to meet our working capital needs in the future, we will be forced to delay or reduce, limit or cease our operations.
