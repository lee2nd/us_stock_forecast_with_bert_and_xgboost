Overview
We are a specialty retailer of natural stone and man-made tiles, setting and maintenance materials, and related accessories in the United States. We offer a wide selection of products, attractive prices, and exceptional customer service in an extensive showroom setting. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 143 stores in 31 states and the District of Columbia, with an average size of approximately 20,000 square feet.
We purchase our tile products and accessories directly from suppliers and manufacture our own setting and maintenance materials, such as thinset, grout, and sealers. We believe that our long-term supplier relationships, together with our design and manufacturing and distribution capabilities, enable us to offer a broad assortment of high-quality products to our customers, who are primarily homeowners and professionals, at competitive prices. We have invested significant resources to develop our proprietary brands and product sources, and we believe that we are a leading retailer of natural stone and man-made tiles, setting and maintenance materials, and related accessories in the United States.
The table below sets forth information about our net sales, operating income and stores opened from 2019 to 2021.
Net sales increased $45.6 million from $325.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $370.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The net sales generated in 2021 represents a new annual sales record due to a 13.8% increase in sales at comparable stores. We believe this result was made possible by strong demand for home improvement products, an increase in ticket averages driven by higher prices for the products that we sell and the execution of our strategy.
We encountered a number of supply chain challenges during 2021. Earlier in the year, we experienced difficulty securing timely delivery of replenishment orders from our vendors which resulted in elevated levels of backorders. We made significant progress reducing backorders and improving our inventory position to $97.2 million as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, we are seeing an increase in the cost of the products we source from around the world due to vendor price increases in response to inflationary cost pressure and an increase in international shipping rates. This cost pressure is having an impact on our gross margin rate which fell to 66.1% during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021. In response to the cost pressure, we have and plan to continue to adjust our prices. We anticipate the cost pressure on our gross margin rates will persist into 2022.
Throughout 2021, we have slowly and deliberately taken steps to reinvest in the business to capture the elevated level of demand we are seeing in the marketplace. Since the beginning of the year, we have taken steps to expand hours in many of our stores, add employees to our workforce, and adjust compensation to remain competitive in the marketplace, particularly in our store warehouses and distribution centers. We have made a number of meaningful investments in technology, including our website, increased our marketing spend, and seen general SG&A expenses increase as we have resumed normal business in 2021. We believe that the steps taken to reinvest in the business in 2021 will position the Company for continued sales growth as we move into 2022.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. COVID-19 has negatively impacted public health and the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, and created volatility in financial markets. We have been negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we anticipate we will continue to be negatively impacted at least throughout the duration of the pandemic. The continuing implications of COVID-19 on us remain uncertain and will depend on certain future developments, including the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic and the effects of new variants of COVID-19, some of which may be more virulent or transmissible than the initial strain; its impact on our employees, customers and suppliers; the range and timing of government mandated restrictions and other measures, including the reimplementation of previously lifted measures or imposition of new measures; and the success of the deployment and widespread adoption of approved COVID-19 vaccines and their effectiveness against new variants of COVID-19. This uncertainty could have a material impact on the accounting estimates and assumptions utilized to prepare our consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods, which could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on our operations during 2020. For instance, we experienced a sharp decline in traffic toward the end of the first quarter of 2020 following the onset of COVID-19 in the United States. In response, we took steps to reduce selling, general and administrative expenses by eliminating a portion of our workforce, reducing store hours, curtailing advertising spending, reducing the number of replenishment trucks sent from our distribution centers to our stores and limiting other SG&A spending when possible. As state and local governments started lifting restrictions toward the end of the second quarter of 2020, we saw an improvement in traffic and sales trends. Throughout the remainder of 2020, we took a cautious approach to investing in activities that would increase our SG&A expenses, which included operating our stores at a reduced hours schedule compared to the prior year.
The pandemic has had a significant impact on our supply chain. During 2021, we experienced elevated levels of product shortages, which were partially due to vendor production delays and global shipping capacity constraints resulting, in part, from the impact of COVID-19. We were able to work with our vendors to secure delivery of backordered product and improve our overall inventory levels as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, many of our vendors have begun to communicate price increases in response to inflationary cost pressure, which, combined with escalated international shipping rates, is resulting in an increase in the cost of our inventory and corresponding pressure on our gross margin rates. In response to this cost pressure, we have adjusted, and plan to continue to adjust, our pricing.
While we are cautiously optimistic with the current business trend and the progress made distributing COVID-19 vaccinations in recent months, the continued sporadic outbreaks of COVID-19 cases occurring globally, as well as the ongoing spread of new COVID-19 variants, could have a negative impact on us. Specifically, we could be adversely impacted by limitations on our employees to perform their work due to illness caused by the pandemic or local, state or federal orders requiring stores to close or employees to remain home; labor shortages resulting from various factors; limitations of carriers to deliver our products to customers; product shortages; limitations on the ability of our customers to conduct their business and purchase our products and services; and limitations on the ability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner. These events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. In addition, even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of the economic impact of the pandemic.
Effects of Inflation
Our operating results are heavily dependent upon the prices paid to acquire manmade and natural store products from our vendors around the world. The cost to source our products has increased over the last year due to an increase in international freight rates and vendor price increases, due in part to higher labor costs, energy prices, and other inflationary pressures. In response to rising costs, we have and plan to continue to adjust our pricing; however, continued volatility and inflationary pressure could adversely affect our financial results.
Other Recent Developments
On November 4, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $0.65 per share payable on December 3, 2021 to the Company’s stockholders of record at the close of business on November 19, 2021. The payment of the special dividend resulted in a $32.9 million return of capital to shareholders during the fourth quarter of 2021.
Key Components of our Consolidated Statements of Operations
Net Sales - Net sales represents total charges to customers, net of returns, and includes freight charged to customers. We recognize sales at the time that the customer takes control of the merchandise or final delivery of the product has occurred. We are required to charge and collect sales and other taxes on sales to our customers and remit these taxes back to government authorities. Total revenues do not include sales tax because we are a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting sales tax. Sales are reduced by a reserve for anticipated sales returns that we estimate based on historical returns.
Comparable store sales growth is the percentage change in sales of comparable stores period-over-period. A store is considered comparable on the first day of the 13th full month of operation. When a store is relocated, it is excluded from the comparable store sales growth calculation. Comparable store sales growth amounts include total charges to customers less any actual returns. We include the change in allowance for anticipated sales returns applicable to comparable stores in the comparable store sales calculation. Comparable store sales data reported by other companies may be prepared on a different basis and therefore may not be useful for purposes of comparing our results to those of other businesses. Company management believes the comparable store sales (decline) growth metric provides useful information to both management and investors to evaluate the Company’s performance, the effectiveness of its strategy and its competitive position.
Cost of Sales - Cost of sales consists primarily of material costs, freight, custom and duty fees, and storage and delivery of product to the customers, as well as physical inventory losses and costs associated with manufacturing of setting and maintenance materials.
Gross Profit - Gross profit is net sales less cost of sales. Gross margin rate is the percentage determined by dividing gross profit by net sales.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses - Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation costs, occupancy, utilities, maintenance costs, advertising cost, shipping and transportation expenses to move inventory from our distribution centers to our stores, and depreciation and amortization.
Pre-opening Costs - Our pre-opening costs are those typically associated with the opening of a new store and generally include rent expense, compensation costs and promotional costs. We expense pre-opening costs as incurred and include these costs in selling, general and administrative expenses.
Income Taxes - We are subject to income tax in the United States as well as other tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business.
Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2021 to the Year Ended December 31, 2020
Net Sales - Net sales increased $45.6 million, or 14.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The sales results during 2020 were adversely impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in reduced store hours, lower levels of traffic and an overall decrease in sales during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Over the last 12 months, we have seen improved sales due to strong demand for home improvement products, an increase in the average ticket driven by higher prices, and the execution of our strategy that have contributed to a 13.8% increase in sales at comparable stores during 2021.
Gross Profit - Gross profit increased $31.6 million, or 14.3%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The gross margin rate was 68.3% and 68.1% for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by better pricing during the first half of 2021 and an improvement in customer delivery collection rates.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses - Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $17.4 million, or 8.1%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase included a $7.3 million increase in variable compensation expenses, a $1.9 million increase in transportation costs and a $1.1 million increase in interchange fees. Additionally, SG&A expenses increased as we resumed normal business operations during 2021 and included a $3.9 million increase in staffing costs, a $1.5 million increase in benefits, and a $1.4 million increase in marketing expenses. We recorded $0.7 million and $2.2 million of asset impairment charges during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
Interest Expense - Interest expense decreased $1.2 million, or 65.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a lower level of average debt in 2021.
Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes - The provision for income taxes increased $6.7 million for 2021 compared to 2020. Our effective tax rate was 26.0% in 2021 and (34.0)% in 2020. The tax benefit recognized during 2020 and the improvement in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the enactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), which gave us the ability to carry back federal net operating losses to years with a federal statutory tax rate of 35%.
Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2020 to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
A detailed discussion of the fiscal year 2020 performance compared to fiscal year 2019 is set forth in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2020 to the Year Ended December 31, 2019,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on March 11, 2021, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.
Non-GAAP Measures
We calculate Adjusted EBITDA by taking net income calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and adjusting for interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and stock based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA margin is equal to Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. We calculate pretax return on capital employed by taking income (loss) from operations divided by capital employed. Capital employed equals total assets less accounts payable, income taxes payable, other accrued liabilities, lease liability and other long-term liabilities. Other companies may calculate both Adjusted EBITDA and pretax return on capital employed differently, limiting the usefulness of these measures for comparative purposes.
We believe that these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, for purposes of determining management incentive compensation, for budgeting and planning purposes, and for assessing the effectiveness of capital allocation over time. These measures are used in monthly financial reports prepared for management and our Board of Directors. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends
and in comparing our financial measures with other specialty retailers, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.
Our management does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitations of these non-GAAP financial measures are that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents non-GAAP financial measures in connection with GAAP results. We urge investors to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.
The reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 follows:
Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 follows:
The calculation of pretax return on capital employed is as follows:
(1)Income statement accounts represent the activity for the trailing twelve months ended as of each of the balance sheet dates. Balance sheet accounts represent the average account balance for the four quarters ended as of each of the balance sheet dates.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal sources of liquidity include $9.4 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2021, cash provided by operating activities and borrowings available under our credit facility. We expect to use this liquidity for purchasing additional merchandise inventory, maintaining our existing stores, reducing outstanding debt and general corporate purposes.
On September 18, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., Fifth Third Bank and Citizens Bank, which was amended November 16, 2021 (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides us with a senior credit facility consisting of a $100.0 million revolving line of credit through September 18, 2023. Borrowings pursuant to the Credit Agreement initially bear interest at a LIBOR or base rate. The LIBOR-based rate ranges from LIBOR plus 1.50% to 2.25% depending on our rent adjusted leverage ratio. The base rate is equal to the greatest of (a) the Federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the Bank of America “prime rate,” and (c) the Eurodollar rate plus 1.00%, in each case plus 0.50% to 1.25% depending on our rent adjusted leverage ratio. At December 31, 2021, the LIBOR-based interest rate was 1.60% and the base rate was 3.75%.
The Credit Agreement is secured by virtually all of our assets, including but not limited to, inventory, receivables, equipment and real property. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, conditions to borrowings, and restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to dispose of assets, make acquisitions, incur additional debt, incur liens, or make investments. The Credit Agreement also includes financial and other covenants, including covenants to maintain certain fixed charge coverage ratios and consolidated total rent adjusted leverage ratios. We were in compliance with the covenants as of December 31, 2021.
We had $5.0 million outstanding on the revolving line of credit as of December 31, 2021. We also have standby letters of credit outstanding related to our workers’ compensation and medical insurance policies. The standby letters of credit totaled $2.4 million on both December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. There was $92.6 million available for borrowing on the revolving line of credit as of December 31, 2021, which may be used to support our growth and for working capital purposes.
During 2022, we expect to use cash purchasing additional merchandise inventory, maintaining our existing stores, and general corporate purposes. Additionally, as described further in Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2021, our lease liability under operating leases totaled $138.5 million as of December 31, 2021. Contractual lease payments range from $17.0 million to $37.4 million on an annual basis over the next five years. We are also obligated to fund certain self-insured employee benefits, including our medical and workers’ compensation plans. As of December 31, 2021, accrual balances related to our estimated workers’ compensation claims and medical claims totaled $2.2 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Additionally, we have contractual obligations related to software service arrangements with suppliers for fixed or minimum amounts. Future minimum payments at December 31, 2021 for purchase obligations were $1.6 million. Amounts due under these arrangements in 2022, 2023 and 2024 total $0.8 million, $0.6 million and $0.2 million, respectively.
We currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and access to cash under our credit facility will be adequate to meet our ongoing operating requirements over the next twelve months and our long-term liquidity requirements.
Capital Expenditures
The following table summarizes our capital expenditures during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Our future capital requirements will vary based on the number of additional stores, distribution centers, and manufacturing facilities that we open and the number of stores that we choose to renovate. Our decisions regarding opening, relocating, or renovating stores, and whether to engage in strategic acquisitions, will be based in part on macroeconomic factors and the general state of the U.S. economy, as well as the local economies in the markets in which our stores are located.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Operating Activities
Cash flows from operating activities provide us with a significant source of liquidity. Net cash provided by operating activities was $39.7 million, $65.6 million, and $38.6 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in operating cash flows in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to a $46.2 million decrease in cash flows associated with the change in inventory levels that was partially offset by an $8.7 million increase in net income.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $11.1 million, $2.0 million and $26.4 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in investing activities in 2021 was due to an increase in capital expenditures during 2021 to invest in one new store, one store relocation, store remodels, store merchandising, distribution, internal fleet and information technology assets.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $28.9 million, $63.3 million and $8.6 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash used in financing activities during 2021 included $32.9 million of dividends paid and $5.0 million of payments on long term debt that were partially offset by $10.0 million of advances on our line of credit.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, but all such estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions, and it is possible that other professionals, applying their own judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support alternative estimates and assumptions that would result in material changes to our operating results and financial condition. Our most critical accounting policies are summarized below. For further information on our critical and other significant accounting policies, see the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.
Recognition of Revenue
Revenues are recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. We recognize service revenue, which consists primarily of freight charges for home delivery, when the service has been rendered. We are required to charge and collect sales and other taxes on sales to our customers and remit these taxes back to government authorities. Total revenues do not include sales tax because we are a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting sales tax. Net sales are reduced by an allowance for anticipated sales returns that we estimate based on historical returns. Our process to establish a sales return reserve contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future sales returns and exchanges. The customer may receive a refund or exchange the original product for a replacement of equal or similar quality for a period of three months from the time of original purchase. Products received back under this policy are reconditioned pursuant to state laws and resold. We believe our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns. Actual return trends have not varied significantly from estimated amounts in prior periods. However, if the nature of sales returns changes significantly, our sales could be adversely impacted. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the balance of the returns reserve was $5.2 million and $5.0 million, respectively.
Inventory Valuation and Shrinkage
Our inventory consists of manufactured items and purchased merchandise held for resale. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (determined using the moving average cost method) or net realizable value. We capitalize the cost of inbound freight, duties, and receiving and handling costs to bring purchased materials into our distribution network. The labor and overhead costs incurred in connection with the production process are included in the value of manufactured finished goods. We provide provisions for losses related to shrinkage and other amounts that are otherwise not expected to be fully recoverable. These provisions are calculated based on historical shrinkage, selling price, margin and current business trends. These estimates have calculations that require management to make assumptions based on the current rate of sales, age, salability and profitability of inventory, historical percentages that can be affected by changes in our merchandising mix, customer preferences, rates of sell through and changes in actual shrinkage trends. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the assumptions we use to calculate our inventory provisions. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the balance of the inventory reserves was $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation, which is amortized over the useful life of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or lease period (including expected renewal periods). As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, net property, plant, and equipment balances were $82.3 million and $99.0 million, respectively.
Property, plant, equipment, and right of use assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets, which typically occurs at an individual store level. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operations and/or disposition of the assets are less than the carrying amount. Significant assumptions used in developing undiscounted cash flow analyses include estimates of future sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value, as appropriate. Significant assumptions used in the fair value analyses include estimates of future sales, gross margin, operating expenses, comparable market rents and discount rates. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in determining future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded asset impairment charges of $0.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively, which were classified in selling, general and administrative expenses. No impairment charges were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We estimate the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction. A valuation allowance for such tax assets and loss carryforwards is provided when it is determined to be more likely than not that the benefit of such deferred tax asset will not be realized in future periods. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used, the related valuation allowance on such assets would be reduced.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued a final standard that primarily requires organizations that lease assets to recognize the rights and obligations created by those leases on the consolidated balance sheet. This standard also requires expanded disclosures to help financial statement users better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. We adopted this standard effective January 1, 2019, using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.
This standard provided a number of optional practical expedients in transition. We elected the package of three practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within this standard, which, among other things, allowed us to carryforward the historical lease classification. We did not separate non-lease components from lease components by class of underlying assets and we did not apply the recognition requirements of the standard to short-term leases, as allowed by the standard.
We also elected to apply the hindsight practical expedient. The election of the hindsight practical expedient resulted in the shortening of lease terms for certain existing leases and the useful lives of corresponding leasehold improvements. In the application of the hindsight practical expedient, we considered recent investments in leased properties and the overall real estate strategy, which resulted in the determination that most renewal options would not be reasonably certain in determining the expected lease term.
Upon adopting this standard, we established a right of use asset of $147.2 million and lease liabilities of $169.9 million, reduced deferred rent by $44.6 million, and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of $22.0 million. This retained earnings impact was due to the election of the hindsight practical expedient, which resulted in a decrease in the cumulative difference between the straight-line rent expense and rental payments that had been made between the inception of each lease and January 1, 2019. The change in the useful life assigned to certain leasehold improvements resulted in a $15.3 million reduction in fixed assets and retained earnings. The net impact of the cumulative effect adjustments also resulted in a $1.7 million reduction of deferred tax assets and a corresponding adjustment to retained earnings. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on net income or cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we adopted new accounting requirements related to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, including trade receivables. The new standard and subsequent amendments replaced the incurred loss impairment model with a forward-looking expected credit loss model, which will generally result in earlier recognition of credit losses. Our allowance
for doubtful accounts represents an estimate of expected credit losses related to our trade receivables. To estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts, we leverage information on historical losses, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions. Account balances are written off against the allowance when we deem the amount is uncollectible. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we adopted a new accounting standard that simplifies accounting for income taxes. Specifically, the new standard simplifies aspects of accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In March 2020, the FASB issued guidance providing optional expedients and exceptions to account for the effects of reference rate reform to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The optional guidance is effective as of the beginning of the reporting period when the election is made through December 31, 2022. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.
