Our Strategy
Our strategy has been to build the most trusted bank in our markets, which we believe
drives value for our stockholders. We are
committed to a culture of serving our clients in extraordinary ways by providing
personalized, relationship-based banking. We believe that
success is achieved through establishing and growing the trust of our
clients, employees, stakeholders, and communities.
During 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic allowed us to serve our
customers by providing PPP loan funding, modifying loans through
payment deferrals and rate adjustments, and using our
technology to reduce contact exposure. Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
in 2021, we remain focused on growth and building stockholder value
through greater efficiency and increased profitability. We intend to
execute our strategic plan through the following:
•
Continue organic growth;
•
Selectively pursue opportunities to expand through acquisitions or
new market development;
•
Attract and develop talent;
•
Improve financial performance;
•
Maintain a branch-lite business model with strategically placed locations; and
•
Leverage technology to enhance the client experience and improve profitability.

COVID-19 Pandemic Impact
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and may continue to cause, economic
uncertainty and a disruption to the financial markets, the
duration and extent of which is not currently known. A discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company and its
operations and measures undertaken by the Company in response thereto is provided
below.
Bank Operations
The Company has a business continuity plan to mitigate operational risks in unusual,
unexpected events. The plan identifies key
components of our operations and creates responses to ensure normal operations
continue and to minimize the effects of potential loss. We
implemented the business continuity procedures in March 2020
as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2021, substantially all
employees returned to on-premises work. In addition, a hybrid work
opportunity was created for most employees. No material interruptions
to our business operations have occurred to date.
Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) Lending Facility
The PPP was established by the CARES Act and authorized forgivable loans to small businesses. The Consolidated Appropriations
Act of 2021 allocated additional PPP funding. The Bank provided PPP loans to support current customers and foster relationships with new
customers. The loans earned interest at 1%, included fees between 1% and 5% and typically matured
in two or five years. The loans
originated under the PPP received a 0% risk weight under the regulatory capital rules which resulted
in increased Common Equity Tier 1,
Tier 1, and Tier 2 capital ratios, but the PPP loans are included in the calculation of our Leverage ratio.
The following table summarizes the impact of the PPP loans on our 2021 and 2020 financials:

Loan Modifications
The CARES Act as extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, allowed financial institutions to elect to suspend GAAP
principles and regulatory determinations for loan modifications relating
to the COVID-19 pandemic that would otherwise require evaluation
as troubled debt restructurings (“TDR”) from March 1, 2020 to January
2, 2022 as long as the loan was not more than 30 days past due as of
December 31, 2019. The Company elected to use this guidance and started the modified
loan process during the first quarter of 2020. As of
December 31, 2021, the Company had 6 loans with an outstanding balance
of $17 million that were still under these modified terms.
Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) Implementation
On January 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic
326): Measurement of Credit
Losses on Financial Instruments.”
Topic 326 replaces the incurred loss model for determining the allowance
for credit losses (“ACL”),
formerly presented as the allowance for loan losses (“ALLL”).
The CECL approach requires immediate recognition of estimated credit losses
expected to occur over the estimated remaining life of the asset. As a result, the new approach may accelerate the recording
of credit losses
compared to the former, incurred loss model. The new standard does not change the
credit risk of the Company’s loans or the ultimate losses
incurred by the Company on those loans. Topic 326 may result in increased volatility in the Company’s
net income and capital levels due to
changes in the reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic
conditions on a quarterly basis.
For information regarding our implementation process, refer to “
Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies”
within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included
elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
The Company adopted Topic 326 through a modified retrospective approach
that results in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained
earnings as of the day of adoption. The Company anticipates the January 1, 2022 ACL to be between $55 million and $61 million compared
to $58 million as of December 31, 2021.
In addition, CECL applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures, such as unfunded lines of credit, financial
guarantees not accounted
for as derivatives, and other unfunded loan commitments. The expected credit loss liability
for off-balance sheet credit exposures is estimated
over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit
risk unless the obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the issuer.
The credit loss estimate for off-balance sheet credit exposure considers the
likelihood that funding will occur and if funded, the related
estimate of expected credit losses. Changes in the estimated credit loss are reported
in the statement of income and the expected credit loss
estimate for unfunded commitments is reported as a liability on the balance
sheet. Once a loan is funded, the expected credit loss for off-
balance sheet exposures will be transferred to the ACL.
The Company expects to record a $4 million to $8 million credit loss liability for
off-balance sheet credit exposures. The credit loss
liability will result in a decrease to retained earnings, net of the deferred tax
asset.
The change in the required ACL is primarily a result of: (i) consolidation of previously disaggregated loan pools, (ii) an increase in
the
lookback period, and (iii) incorporation of reasonable and supportable
forecasts. Under the incurred loss model, the Company disaggregated
loans by risk ratings and loan categories. Under the CECL model, the Company’s pools were reduced
and did not sub-segment by risk rating.
The change in the Company’s loan pools is expected to decrease the required
reserve as of January 1, 2022. The incurred loss model’s look-
back period was short compared to the CECL methodology that requires the use of a full economic cycle. The change in the
look-back period
is expected to decrease the required reserve. The application of forward-looking
guidance is new under the CECL methodology. The
Company uses the unemployment rate guidance provided by the Federal
Reserve and reverts to an average unemployment rate outside of the
forecast periods. The change in methodology does not materially impact the Company’s loans
that were impaired as of December 31, 2021.
The reserve for unfunded commitments that are not unconditionally cancelable
by the Company will be driven by: (i) The type of loan
commitment which are grouped using the same loan pools for the loan portfolio.
For example, the expected funding of residential
construction loans is expected to be higher than funding for energy loans; (ii)
changes in historical loss rates; (iii) qualitative factors;
and (iv)
average utilization rates.
Topic 326 eliminates the other than temporary impairment (“OTTI”) methodology
on available-for-sale securities. The OTTI method
is replaced with an allowance and related credit loss expense. This allows subsequent increases in
fair market value of the security to be
recognized by reducing the allowance and reversing previous credit loss expense
recorded. The Company’s available-for-sale securities were
not materially impacted by Topic 326’s implementation.
We anticipate the implementation of Topic 326 will not have a material impact on our capital ratios. The Federal
Reserve System, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency adopted a joint final rule for an optional phase-in
period of three years for banks to absorb the impact to regulatory capital
of implementing the new CECL standard. For the first year of the
transition, the Company may reduce the impact of CECL on retained earnings by 75%. For years two
and three, the regulatory capital
schedules would continue to be adjusted based on declining amount of 25% each
year.
Customer and Industry Concentrations
As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s top 20 customer relationships, represented
approximately 27% or $1.2 billion of total
deposits. The majority of the $1.2 billion are money market deposit accounts. The Company believes
that there are sufficient funding
sources, including on-balance sheet liquid assets and wholesale deposit
options, so that an immediate reduction in these deposit balances
would not be expected to have a detrimental effect on the Company’s financial
position or operations.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, a significant portion of the
Company’s ATM and credit card interchange income was driven by
companies that mobilized their workforce directly impacted by the
COVID-19 pandemic. These companies represented $5 million or 61% of
the $8 million in ATM and credit card interchange income. We anticipate that the related non-interest income will fluctuate in the near term
based on COVID-19 pandemic.
Update to 2021 Events Discussed in the Previous 10-K
Four of our branches are in areas that were impacted by severe, cold weather conditions
in February and March of 2021. One branch
sustained water damage but did not impact operations or our ability to support
our customers. In 2021, the Company repaired and replaced
the property and equipment impacted by the water damage. The related cost was primarily
paid for by our insurance provider.
Discussion and Analysis - Results
of Operations
Net Interest Income
Our profitability depends in substantial part on our net interest income. Net interest
income is the difference between the amounts
received on our interest-earning assets and the interest paid on our interest-bearing
liabilities. Net interest income is impacted by internal and
external factors including:
•
Changes in the volume, rate, and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities;
•
Changes in competition, federal economic, monetary and fiscal policies and
economic conditions; and
•
Changes in credit quality.
We present and discuss net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis. A tax-equivalent basis presents all income taxable at the same
rate. For example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $126.58,
an amount that, if taxed at the statutory federal income tax
rate of 21% would yield $100. We believe a tax-equivalent basis provides for
improved comparability between the various earning assets.
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 to the second quarter of 2019,
we operated in a rising interest rate environment. Our
yield on earning assets and cost of funds were driven by the rate environment. In
July 2019, interest rates started to decline and continued
through 2021. Our earning assets repriced quicker than our cost of funds, resulting
in a lower net interest margin in 2019 and 2020. During
2021, the Company benefited from changes in our deposit mix, including
an increase in non-interest-bearing deposits and a reduction in time
deposits that improved our overall cost of funds. The reduced cost of funds was offset by reductions
in earning-asset yields. A table showing
our three-year yield on earning assets and cost of funds is presented below:

The change in interest not due solely to volume or rate has been allocated in proportion to the respective absolute dollar amounts of the change in
volume or rate.
Interest Income -
Interest income declined for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021
compared to the same period in 2020. Lower
yields on earning assets were driven by a decline in the interest rate environment
in the first half of 2020 which persisted in 2021 and
increased competition driven by a surge in deposits in 2021. The decline in asset yields was partially
offset by year-over-year loan growth
and PPP loan income. PPP loan fees and interest income improved the earning asset yield by 4 basis points for the year ended December
31,
2021.
The Company currently anticipates loan yields to increase in 2022 due to anticipated rate hikes
by the Federal Open Market
Committee.
Interest Expense -
Interest expense declined for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021
compared to the same period in 2020. The
cost of interest-bearing deposits declined due to strategic rate changes in our
deposit products driven by the declining rate environment. The
average volume for interest-bearing deposits declined primarily because
of time deposit maturities and current rates on time deposits.
Average FHLB and other borrowings declined compared to 2020, as the
Company’s increase in cash offset the need to renew or increase
these borrowings. The increase in the cost of FHLB borrowings was the result of $771 thousand in prepayment
penalties related to $40
million of FHLB borrowings. In addition, the increase in the cost of funds was impacted
by short-term duration borrowings with lower rates
that matured in 2020 and were not renewed. We currently anticipate our cost of funds will increase
due to expected increases in the interest
rate environment although that may be offset by a greater mix of non-interest-bearing
deposits based on current trends.
Net Interest Income -
Net interest income increased for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021
compared to the same period in
2020.
The increase in net interest income was driven by reductions in interest-bearing deposit rates as well as
a reduction in time deposits
which was partially offset by lower rates on earning assets. Reductions in
earning asset yields were offset by reductions in the cost of
interest-bearing liabilities that resulted in a $747 thousand increase in net
interest income.
We currently expect the net interest margin to
remain flat or slightly increase in 2022 as the Company anticipates earning
assets to reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a rising
rate environment.
Our expected margin may continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, placing
loans on non-accrual status,
including loans with deferred payments, and changes in competition.

Impact of Transition
Away from LIBOR
The Company had more than $1.3
billion in loans tied to LIBOR at December 31, 2021. Starting in October 2021,
the Company began
limiting loans originated using the LIBOR index. For current borrowers,
the Company is modifying loan document language to account for
the transition away from LIBOR as loans renew or originate. The Company
plans to replace LIBOR-based loans with the Secured Overnight
Financing Rate (“SOFR”).
The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-04 “Reference
Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation
of the Effects of
Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting” in 2020. The ASU allows the
Company to recognize the modification related to LIBOR as a
continuation of the old contract, rather than a cancellation of the old contract
resulting in a write-off of unamortized fees and creation
of a
new contract.

The changes in noninterest income were driven by the following:
Service charges and fees on customer accounts -
This category includes account analysis fees offset by a customer
rebate program. The
increase for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020
was driven by a decline in costs associated with our rebate program,
including a reduction in the funded balance and reduction in rates used. In
addition, customer growth and an increase in outstanding balances
improved account analysis fees.
Realized gains on available-for-sale securities -
The Company sells available-for-sale securities for strategic reasons including
capitalizing
on attractive market conditions, improving the credit quality of the security portfolio,
or for tax purposes,
primarily to offset capital losses.
The realized gains on available-for-sale securities declined from 2020
to 2021 primarily due to a lower number of securities being sold. In
2020,
sales were made to capitalize on attractive market conditions and improve credit
quality.
In 2021, the Company sold securities for tax
purposes and to capitalize on attractive market conditions.
Gains (losses), net on equity securities -
During 2021, the Company recorded a $6 million loss related to an
equity investment received as
part of a modified loan agreement in 2020. The Company elected to account for this security at cost
less impairment, unless an orderly
transaction for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer occurred that
would result in an updated fair market value. During 2021,
significant adverse changes in market conditions for the investment resulted in
the investment being sold below its book value. Refer to the
“Equity Securities” section in
Note 3: Securities
within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Income from bank-owned life insurance -
The increase for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared
to 2020 was due to the Company
recognizing $2 million in tax-free death benefits from a bank-owned life insurance poli
cy in 2021 compared to $0 of such proceeds for 2020.
Swap fee income, net -
Swap fee income, net, includes both swap fees from the execution of new
swaps and the credit valuation adjustment
(“CVA”). Swap fees on new swaps depend on the size and term of the underlying
asset. During 2020, a borrower with a back-to-back swap
was downgraded and resulted in a $300 thousand loss related to the CVA. During
2021, the same borrower chose to eliminate its back-to-
back swap, resulting in reversal of the CVA adjustment made in 2020.
ATM and credit card interchange income -
The increase in ATM and credit card interchange income for the year ended December 31,
compared to 2020 was primarily the result of customers that mobilized their workforce directly
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Company anticipates the credit card activity and related income will continue
to fluctuate in connection with changes in COVID-19
cases and the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.
Other non-interest income -
The increase in other non-interest income for the year ended December
31, 2021 compared to 2020 was
primarily related to a $809 thousand increase in state employment incentives
received during 2021. We expect to continue to receive the
incentives quarterly going forward for three years, but at significantly lower
amounts. The Company also saw a $374 thousand increase in
letter of credit and foreign exchange fees for the period ended December 31, 2021
compared to 2020.

The changes in noninterest expense were driven by the following:
Salary and Employee Benefits -
Salary and employee benefit costs increased for the year ended December
31, 2021
compared to 2020
primarily due to increased hiring for market expansion and an increase in
anticipated payouts for performance-based awards that resulted
from improved earnings and asset quality metrics. In addition, the Company
recognized $719 thousand in expense during 2021 due to
accelerated vesting of stock-based awards and the annual incentive award
of a former employee. We currently anticipate salary and employee
benefit costs to increase in 2022 due to new market locations, merit increases and
additional hiring.
Occupancy -
Occupancy costs increased for the period ended December 31, 2021
compared to 2020 primarily due to our new locations in
the rapidly growing Frisco, Texas market and Phoenix, Arizona market and our more prominent location on
the Country Club Plaza, in
Kansas City, Missouri.
We currently anticipate occupancy costs to increase slightly in 2022
as a result of an additional location in the Dallas
market.
Professional Fees -
Professional fees decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021
compared to the same corresponding period in 2020
primarily from a reduction in legal fees related to PPP loan originations and loan workouts.
Deposit Insurance Premiums -
The FDIC uses a risk-based premium system to calculate the quarterly fee.
Our costs fluctuate because
of changes in asset growth, changes in asset quality and changes in capital ratios.
During 2021, the Company benefited from improved
earnings that increased average tangible equity while average assets remained
flat between 2020 and 2021.
Advertising -
The
increase in advertising costs was driven by increased in-person events for the year
ended December 31, 2021 compared
to 2020 because of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions being lifted.
Software and Communication -
The increase was driven by our continued strategy to invest in technologies that allow us to cover
beginning-to-end loan originations, provide customers with a suite of online tools
and analyze operational trends. In addition to the growing
number of technologies implemented, a portion of the increase in costs was due
to our growth. We currently anticipate our software and
communication costs to increase in 2022 as we continue adding and implementing
new software products that improve our customer’s
experience.
Foreclosed Assets, net -
The decrease in foreclosed assets, net for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020
resulted from the
Company selling a commercial use facility foreclosed upon in 2020 during
2021 at a loss that was slightly offset by the sale of raw land
acquired in 2019 at a gain. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the
Company sold industrial facilities acquired in 2019 that resulted in
a $844 thousand loss and impaired raw land acquired in 2019.
Goodwill Impairment -
The Company performed an interim review for goodwill impairment in 2020. A quantitative review was
performed on the Tulsa market reporting unit and resulted in a $7 million impairment.
Refer to
Note 6: Goodwill and Core Deposit
Intangible
within the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information.
Other noninterest expense -
Year-over-year changes included a $2 million increase in commercial
card costs as a result of our growing
customer base and increased use as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In addition, insured cash sweep (“ICS”) deposits increased in 2021
from 2020, which drove related fees higher.
Income Taxes
Our income tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount that would
be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primarily from
investments in tax advantaged assets, such as bank-owned life insurance
and tax-exempt municipal securities, state tax credits and permanent
tax differences from equity-based compensation. Detail behind the differences
between the statutory rate and effective tax rate for the years
ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is provided in
Note 11: Income Taxes
within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The December 31, 2020 effective tax rate increase from December 31,
2019 was due to the non-taxable, goodwill impairment in 2020
and a state tax credit received in 2019. The 2021 income tax expense was impacted
by a $71.7 million increase in income before income
taxes that increased taxes at the statutory rate by $15 million. The tax-exempt benefit diminishes
as the Company’s ratio of taxable income to
tax-exempt income increases. We currently anticipate the effective tax rate to increase slightly
in 2022. A three-year trend of our income tax
and effective tax rate is presented below:

Discussion and Analysis - Financial
Condition
Loan Portfolio
Loans represent our largest portion of earning assets and typically provide higher
yields than other assets. The quality and
diversification of the loan portfolio is an important consideration when
reviewing our financial condition. We established an internal loan
policy that outlines a standard lending philosophy and provides consistent direction
to achieve goals and objectives, which include
maximizing earnings over the short and long term by managing risks through
the policy. Internal concentration limits exist on all loans,
including commercial real estate, energy, and land development. We established strong
underwriting practices and procedures to assess our
borrowers, including review of debt service, collateral value and evaluation
of guarantors. We also engage third-parties to independently
review our loan portfolio. Appropriate actions are taken when a borrower is no longer able to service its debt.
Our loan portfolio consists of various types of loans, primarily made up of commercial
and commercial real estate loans. Commercial
loans are generally paid back through normal business operations. Commercial
real estate loans, which include both construction and limited
term financing are typically paid back through normal income from operations,
the sale of the underlying property or refinancing by other
institutional sources. Most of our loans are made to borrowers within the states we operate,
which include Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma,
Arizona and Texas. In addition, we occasionally invest in syndicated shared national credits and loan
participations.
Gross loans, net of unearned income declined $186 million from the prior
year to $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2021. Our
commercial loan portfolio increased by $63 million or 5% as a result of
approximately $678 million in loan originations and drawdowns that
were able to offset commercial loan paydowns.
Our commercial real estate loans experienced growth of $102 million or 9%. This was driven
by strong originations of approximately $318 million and approximately
$108 million of loans that completed construction and were
transferred into our commercial real estate portfolio from the construction
and land development portfolio.
Residential and multifamily real
estate decreased $80 million or 12% driven by payoffs of several, larger credit facilities.
Energy loans decreased $66 million or 19%
primarily due to paydowns on outstanding lines of credit and management’s strategy
to lower our energy loan concentration. Gross loans
included $65 million and $292 million of PPP loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, loan yields
declined to 4.02% compared to 4.26% in the prior year, primarily as a result
of lower interest rates from adjustable rate loan movements in
LIBOR and Prime.
As of December 31, 2021, PPP loans made up approximately 1% of the total portfolio, representing
$65 million in loans. Refer to the
COVID-19 Pandemic Impact
located in Management’s Discussion and Analysis section above for additional information regarding PPP
loans.

Allowance for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses is an amount required to cover net loan charge-offs
plus the amount which, in the opinion of the Bank’s
management, is considered necessary to bring the balance in the allowance to, or
maintain the balance in the allowance at, a level adequate to
absorb expected loan losses in the existing loan portfolio. Management uses available
information to analyze losses on loans; however, future
additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic
conditions, the size of the loan portfolio, the composition of the
portfolio, or the performance of individual loans.
For a discussion of the evaluation of the Company’s allowance for loan losses refer
to the “Allowance for Loan Losses” section in
Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
For information regarding the Company’s charge-offs and recoveries
for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, refer to
“Note 4: Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses” within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Prior to 2020, loans risk rated substandard or lower were considered impaired
and evaluated on an individual basis. For the years
ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, loans risk rated substandard, on accrual
and not a TDR, were evaluated collectively. The change in
approach provided a better estimate of potential losses inherent in the substandard
portfolio.
The December 31, 2021 ALLL decreased $17 million or 22% from the prior year. The year-over-year change in the ALLL was the
result of $13 million of net charge-offs and $4 million release of reserves. The Company
upgraded approximately $380 million of loans
during the period ended December 31, 2021 and downgraded approximately
$122 million of loans during the same period. Risk rating
changes resulted in a $10 million reduction in the required reserve for 2021.
The December 31, 2020 ALLL increased $18 million or 32% from the prior year. The year-over-year change in the ALLL was the
result of $38 million of net charge-offs offset by a $57 million increase in our
provision. The Company downgraded approximately
$843 million of loans between December 31, 2019 and 2020. Downgrades primarily
resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic, lower economic
activity and lower oil and gas prices. In addition, substandard, accruing loans not
considered a TDR totaled $187 million at December 31,
2020 compared to $40 million at December 31, 2019.
The December 31, 2019 ALLL increased $19 million or 50% from the prior year. The year-over-year change in the allowance was the
result of a $791 million increase in gross loans, net of unearned income that increased
the required reserve by approximately $9 million. In
addition, the allowance included a $13 million increase in the reserve associated
with our impaired loans that was primarily the result of one
nonperforming commercial loan relationship in which the borrower’s
business and the value of the underlying collateral continued to
deteriorate in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase was partially offset by a decline in the energy
portfolio’s qualitative loss factors due to
stabilized oil prices and the current stage of the business cycle that resulted in a $3
million decline in the required reserve.
Grade Migration
Loan categories significantly impacted by grade changes are discussed below.
Energy
- Approximately $119 million of energy loans had a risk rating upgrade for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition,
the energy portfolio decreased by $66 million in 2021. These changes were
the result of higher oil prices and overall market condition
improvements. The improvements above resulted in an $9 million reduction in
the required reserve for 2021.
The increase in supply realized during the first quarter of 2020 and decrease
in demand for oil and natural gas created by the COVID-
19 pandemic placed considerable pricing volatility and uncertainty
in the market for the year ended December 31, 2020. As a result, $254
million of energy loans were downgraded, including $83 million downgraded
to substandard and accruing in 2020. The downgrades
increased the December 31, 2020 ALLL by approximately $11 million, including $8 million related to loans downgraded to substandard and
accruing.
Commercial Real Estate (“CRE”)
- The improved market conditions in 2021
positively impacted our CRE borrowers. During the
year-ended December 31, 2021, approximately $150 million
of CRE loans were upgraded and approximately $95 million were downgrade
d.
The upgrades decreased the ALLL by approximately $5 million for 2021. The improved credit quality of the CRE portfolio was offset by
loan growth driven by strong originations and customer drawdowns on
lines of credit that increased the ALLL by approximately $3 million.
The decline in economic activity in 2020 impacted our CRE borrowers. During the
year ended December 31, 2020, the Company
downgraded $336 million of CRE loans, including $196 million downgraded
to watch, within our pass rated loan category, and $58 million
downgraded to substandard and accruing. The downgrades increased the December
31, 2020 ALLL by approximately $8 million, including
$6 million related to loans downgraded to substandard and accruing.
Commercial
- The increase in economic activity in 2021 compared to 2020 improved demand
for our borrowers’ products and
services. As a result, approximately $110 million of commercial loans were upgraded,
partially offset by $21 million that were downgraded.
The improved credit quality reduced the ALLL by $2 million, partially offset by commercial loan growth that increased the ALLL.
The decline in economic activity in 2020 significantly impacted supply and
demand for our borrowers’ products and services. As a
result, $232 million of commercial loans were downgraded, including
$56 million of loans listed as substandard and accruing. The
downgrades increased the ALLL by approximately $6 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, charge-offs primarily related
to three commercial borrowers that were unable to support their
debt obligations and one energy loan. The energy charge-off related to the sale of collateral
from a borrower that filed for bankruptcy in a
previous year. Recoveries totaled $703 thousand as of December 31, 2021
and were primarily related to a commercial loan and a residential
real estate loan that were previously charged-off in 2020.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, charge-offs included: (i) $19 million
related to a commercial loan that deteriorated and was
substantially reserved for during 2019 that required a $2 million increase to
the 2020 provision, (ii) $6 million related to a large commercial
loan restructured in 2020 that required a $5 million increase to the 2020 provision,
(iii) $6 million related to several, smaller commercial
loans that required a $5 million increase to the 2020 provision, (iv) $5 million
related to three energy loans that were classified or listed as
special mention in 2019 and required a $4 million increase to the 2020 provision,
and (iv) a $2 million charge-off related to a commercial
real estate loan impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that required
a $1 million increase to the 2020 provision.
Charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2019 included $8 million
related to two commercial loans. The commercial loans were
partially charged-off. In addition, one energy credit accounted for $3
million in charge-offs during 2019.
Impaired Loans and Other Factors
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the impaired loan portfolio
decreased $65 million compared to December 31, 2020. The
reserve on the impaired loan portfolio decreased $4 million driven by
paydowns and risk rating upgrades. Changes in qualitative and
quantitative rates on pass rated loans decreased the ALLL by $1 million due to improved general economic conditions offset by balance
increases on pass rated loans that increased the ALLL by $5 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the impaired loan portfolio increased
the ALLL by $7 million after taking out the impact of
the charge-offs mentioned above. Changes in qualitative and quantitative
rates on pass rated loans increased the ALLL by $6 million
primarily due to an increase in 2020 charge-offs that impacted the historical charge
-off ratios and declines in economic activity offset by
balance reductions on pass rated loans that decreased the ALLL by $4 million.
While no portion of our allowance for loan losses is in any way restricted to any individual
loan or group of loans and the entire
allowance is available to absorb losses from any and all loans, the following

Nonperforming Assets
Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, foreclosed assets held
for sale and impaired securities. Nonperforming loans
include nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing
interest and loans modified under TDR that are not performing in
accordance with their modified terms. For information regarding nonperforming
loans and related accounting policies refer to the
“Nonperforming Loans” section within
Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
within the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. For a breakout of the loan portfolio's nonaccrual
loans refer to “Nonaccrual loans” within
Note 4: Loans
and Allowance for Loan Losses
. For information on TDRs, refer to “Troubled Debt Restructurings” section in
Note 4: Loans and Allowance
for Loan Losses
within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
At December 31, 2021, nonperforming assets decreased $46 million or 58%
from December 31, 2020 due primarily to upgrades and
pay offs in the commercial and energy portfolios. As of December 31, 2021, 49% of nonperforming assets related to energy
credits
that were
significantly impacted by lower oil prices over the past few years.
At December 31, 2020, nonperforming assets increased $31 million or
64% from 2019. $60 million of loans became nonperforming in
2020, offset by a $19 million charge-off in 2020 on a nonperforming loan with
a balance of $21 million at December 31, 2019 and pay
downs of $6 million related to December 31, 2019 nonperforming loans. A number of nonperforming loans were significantly impacted by
the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonperforming loans included businesses in the following
industries: (i) hotel, (ii) senior housing, and a few
commercial credits. As of December 31, 2020, 34% of the nonperforming asset balance related to energy credits caused
by volatility in the
oil and natural gas market.
At December 31, 2019, nonperforming assets increased $30 million or
169% from 2018. During 2019, a commercial loan relationship
with an outstanding balance of $30 million was restructured as a TDR due to financial
problems. By December 31, 2019, the commercial
TDR was in default of the modified terms as the borrower’s business and the value of
the underlying collateral continued to deteriorate. This
$30 million loan relationship was the primary reason for the increase in nonperforming
assets and the increase in the ALLL to period end
nonperforming loans.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company foreclosed
on $4 million of assets, including land and industrial assets.
These assets related to one commercial loan and one commercial real estate loan. During the
year ended December 31, 2020, these assets
were written-down by $1 million and the industrial facilities were sold. In
addition, the Company foreclosed on a commercial real estate
building valued at $1 million. For information regarding the foreclosed
assets held-for-sale refer to
Note 8: Foreclosed Assets
within the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

terms and had been outstanding through the period or since inception,
the gross interest income that would have been recorded for the year
ended December 31, 2021 would have been $3 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, $1 million of interest income
was recognized related to the $75 million in nonaccrual loans
above. If the loans had been current in accordance with their original
terms and had been outstanding through the period or since inception,
the gross interest income that would have been recorded for the year
ended December 31, 2020 would have been $2 million.
Other Asset Quality Metrics
Other asset quality metrics management reviews include loans past due
30 - 89 days and classified loans. The Company defines
classified loans as loans categorized as substandard - performing, substandard
- nonperforming, doubtful or loss. For the definitions of
substandard, doubtful and loss, refer to the “Loans by Risk Rating” section within
Note 4: Loan and Allowance for Loan Losses
in the Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The decrease in the balance of December 31, 2021 loans past due between 30
and 89 days was driven by improved market conditions
and improved credit quality metrics during 2021 as classified assets decreased
$209 million and the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total
loans decreased to 1.37%
from 1.70%
in the prior year. The improvements in credit metrics were primarily driven by upgrades in
COVID-19
impacted segments and the energy portfolio.
The Company continually analyzes economic and other factors including
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in oil
and gas prices among other considerations.
Our discussion regarding grade migration is provided within the “allowance

Investment Portfolio
Our investment portfolio is governed by our investment policy that sets our
objectives, limits and liquidity requirements among other
items. The portfolio is maintained to serve as a contingent, on-balance sheet source
of liquidity. The objective of our investment portfolio is
to optimize earnings, manage credit risk, ensure adequate liquidity, manage
interest rate risk, meet pledging requirements and meet
regulatory capital requirements. Our investment portfolio is generally
comprised of government sponsored entity securities and U.S. state
and political subdivision securities with limits set on all types of securities.
At the date of purchase, all debt securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.
Since interest rates move in cycles, having an
available-for-sale portfolio allows management to: (i) protect against additional
unrealized market valuation losses; (ii) provide more
liquidity as rates rise, which often coincides with increasing loan demand
and slower deposit growth; and (iii) generate more money to
reinvest when rates are higher giving the institution an opportunity to lock in
higher yields. In the event the available-for-sale portfolio
becomes too large given the constraints set in the policy, investments may be classified
as held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity classification
will only be used if we have the intent and ability to hold the investment to
its maturity.
At December 31, 2021, available-for-sale debt securities increased $91
million or 14% from the prior year-end. During 2021, the
Company purchased $117 million of tax-exempt municipal securities and $108
million of mortgage-backed securities primarily to utilize
liquidity and increase the Company’s interest-earning assets.
As part of management’s investment strategy during 2020, the Company
chose not to replace all the cash flows associated with
mortgage-backed security prepayments and realized gains from
selling securities that were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic
or at risk of possible downgrades. Securities showing signs of credit stress, faster
prepayments and low reinvestment yield options were
analyzed to ensure adequate levels of risk were maintained within the portfolio.
During 2019, the investment portfolio increased to manage our liquidity
position. In 2018, the investment portfolio declined from the
prior year as we moved liquid assets to support higher yielding assets. Prior to fiscal year
2018, we purchased securities of states of the U.S.
and political subdivisions as part of our tax and liquidity strategies.
For information related to the book value and fair value of our available
-for-sale securities at December 31, 2021 and 2020 refer to the
“Available-for-Sale Securities” segment in
Note 3: Securities
within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For information
related to the investment maturity schedule and weighted average yield for
each range of maturities refer to the “Maturity Schedule” segment
in
Note 3: Securities
within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Bank-Owned Life Insurance (“BOLI”)
The Company maintains investments in BOLI policies to help control employee
benefit costs, as a protection against loss of certain
employees and as a tax planning strategy. The increase in yield in 2021 was primarily due to the Company
recognizing $2 million in tax-free
death benefits from a bank-owned life insurance policy. The decline in yield between
December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020 was
attributable to the insurance carrier’s underlying investments and operating
costs that decreased overall income on the underlying asset.
The following table provides the balance of BOLI income earned and tax-equivalent
yield for the periods indicated:

Deposits
Deposits come through our markets as well as through participation in
certain wholesale programs. The Company offers a variety of
deposit products including non-interest-bearing demand deposits and interest-bearing
deposits that include transaction accounts (including
NOW accounts), savings accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit. The Bank also
acquires brokered deposits, internet
subscription certificates of deposit, and reciprocal deposits through
the Intrafi Network. The reciprocal deposits include both the Certificate
of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”) and Insured Cash Sweep (“ICS”) program. The Company is a member of
the Intrafi
Network which effectively allows depositors to receive FDIC insurance on
amounts greater than the FDIC insurance limit, which is currently
$250 thousand. The Intrafi Network allows institutions to break large deposits into smaller amounts
and place them in a network of other
Intrafi Network institutions to ensure full FDIC insurance is gained on the entire deposit.

Cost of deposits
Deposit accounts are added by loan cross-selling, client referrals and involvement
within our community.
At December 31, 2021, deposits decreased $11 million or less than 1% from
the prior year-end. Non-interest-bearing deposits
increased $445 million or 62% from December 31, 2020 to December
31, 2021. The increase in non-interest-bearing deposits was driven by
approximately $350 million of increased deposits from current customers
and approximately $363 million from new deposit relationships,
offset by deposit withdrawals.
At December 31, 2021, non-interest-bearing deposits represented 25%
of total deposits. Savings and money
market deposits increased $205 million as of December 31, 2021
as a result of both new deposit relationships and increased deposits from
current customers. Transaction deposits and time deposits decreased by $242 million
and $419 million, respectively. The significant decrease
in time deposits resulted from the low interest rate environment. Approximately $794 million of time deposits matured
in 2021, offset by
$394 million of new and renewed time deposits. As a result of the change in deposit mix and reduction of deposit interest rates, the
Company
improved the overall cost of deposits, which declined 45 basis points compared
to December 31, 2020.
During 2020, deposits grew $771 million or 20% from the prior year. Deposit growth
was driven by demand in our ICS deposit
product that increased $516 million from the prior year. The ICS product provided customers
with the ability to manage their cash flow
during the COVID-19 pandemic while providing insurance. In addition,
our interest-bearing checking accounts saw higher demand due to
PPP loan fundings. Compared to 2019, time deposits declined by $196 million or 16% and money
market deposits declined by $52 million as
customers moved into more attractive products.

As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $2.4
billion of uninsured deposits, which is an estimated amount based on the same methodologies
and assumptions
used for the Bank’s regulatory requirements. The Company believes that its current
capital ratios and liquidity are sufficient to mitigate the risks of uninsured
deposits.
Other Borrowed Funds
Since it may not be possible to achieve the institution’s overall funding needs
through core deposit funding, other borrowings may be used to support asset growth.
Management
has a funds management policy and committee, which supports the use of
other borrowings. The risks associated with other borrowings are addressed in the same
fashion as other balance
sheet risks incurred by the Bank. Credit risk, interest rate risk, concentration risk,
capital adequacy and liquidity are measured for the balance sheet as a whole, including
any wholesale
funding strategies that have been implemented or are expected to be
implemented.

The difference between the interest rate above and the interest rate in the table below is due to the Company assuming a liability with a fair value of $1 million related to the assumption of trust
preferred securities issued by Leawood Bancshares Statutory Trust I for $4 million on September 30, 2005. In 2012, the Company settled litigation related to the trust preferred securities which
decreased the principal balance by $2 million and the recorded balance by approximately $400 thousand. The difference between the recorded amount and the contract value of $3 million is being
accreted to the maturity date in 2035.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company is subject to contractual obligations made in the ordinary
course of business. The obligations include deposit liabilities,
other borrowed funds, and operating leases. Refer to
Note 10: Borrowing Arrangements
within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for a listing of our December 31, 2021 significant contractual
cash obligations to third parties on debt obligations. Refer to
Note
18: Operating Leases
within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary
of our contractual cash obligations to third
parties on lease obligations.
As a financial services provider, the Company is a party to various financial instruments
with off-balance sheet risks, such as
commitments to extend credit.
Off-balance sheet arrangements represent the Company’s future cash requirements.
However, a portion of
these commitments may expire without being drawn upon. Refer to
Note 21: Commitments and Credit Risk
within the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for a listing of our December 31, 2021 off-balance
sheet arrangements.
The Company’s short-term and long
-term contractual obligations, including off-balance
sheet obligations, may be satisfied through
our on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liquidity
discussed below.
Liquidity
Liquidity is the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash from depositors,
stockholders, profits or other funding sources, to meet
our needs for funding, including payments to borrowers, operational
costs, capital requirements and other strategic cash flow needs.
Our liquidity policy governs our approach to our liquidity position. The objective is to maintain
adequate, but not excessive, liquidity
to meet the daily cash flow needs of our clients while attempting to achieve
adequate earnings for our stockholders. Our liquidity position is
monitored continuously by our finance department.
Liquidity resources can be derived from two sources: (i) on-balance
sheet liquidity resources, which represent funds currently on the
balance sheet; and (ii) off-balance sheet liquidity resources, which represent
funds available from third-party sources. On-balance sheet
liquidity resources include overnight funds, short-term deposits with other
banks, available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities, and certain other
sources. Off-balance sheet liquidity resources consist of credit lines, wholesale
deposits and debt funding and certain other sources.
On-balance sheet liquidity resources can be broken down into three
sections: (i) primary liquidity resources, which represent liquid
funds that are on the balance sheet; (ii) tertiary liquidity resources, which represent
assets that can be sold into the secondary market; and (iii)
public funds, which represent deposits. Primary liquidity resources
include overnight funds plus short-term, interest-bearing deposits with
other banks and unpledged AFS securities. Tertiary liquidity resources include loans that can be sold into the secondary market or
through
participation and unpledged securities classified as held-to-maturity.
Public funds are another source of wholesale deposits as they require
collateral.
Off-balance sheet liquidity resources require sufficient collateral, in the
form of loans or securities, and have a larger, negative impact
on our capital ratios. As a result, off-balance sheet liquidity has a higher cost on our asset growth compared to deposit growth.
Off-balance
sheet liquidity exists in several forms including: (i) internet subscription
certificates of deposit; (ii) brokered deposits; (iii) borrowing
capacity; (iv) repurchase agreements; or (v) other sources.
Internet subscription certificates of deposit are deposits made through national,
wholesale certificates of deposit funding programs.
These programs are designed to provide funding outside of the Bank’s normal
market or existing client base and allow the Bank to diversify
its wholesale funding resources. This form of funding does not require collateral and generally
cannot be redeemed early. Brokered deposits
are deposits funded through various broker-dealer relationships. The market for
wholesale deposits is well developed. A key feature of this
type of funding is that it is generally unsecured and does not require collateral
for pledging.
Borrowing capacity refers to a form of liability-based funding. Repurchase
agreements are another source of short-term funding in
which a bank agrees to sell a security to a counterparty and repurchase the same or
an identical security from the counterparty at a specified
future date and price. Public funds are another source of wholesale deposits as they
require collateral.
Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily met
through cash flow from operations, redeployment of prepaying
and maturing balances in our loan portfolio and security portfolio, increases
in client deposits and wholesale deposits. Other alternative
sources of funds will supplement these primary sources to the extent necessary
to meet additional liquidity requirements on either a short-
term or long-term basis.
The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows summarize our sources
and uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended
December 31, 2021 and 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $483 million compared
to $409 million at
December 31, 2020. The change in cash and cash equivalents was due to an $88 million increase in
cash provided by operating activities, a
$93 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities and net
cash provided by investing activities of $79 million. During 2021,
liquid assets increased as deposit growth outpaced loan growth. Depositors increased
as customer liquidity improved through various
economic factors. In addition, the Company was able to payoff matured borrowings
without replacing them with new debt. Our portfolio of
on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liquidity continues to exceed
the amount we estimate we would need to manage through an adverse
liquidity event.
At December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $409 million compared
to $187 million at December 31, 2019. The
change in cash and cash equivalents was due to an $80 million increase in cash provided
by operating activities, a $686 million increase in
cash provided by financing activities and net cash used in investing activities of $545
million. During 2020, liquid assets increased as an
indirect result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The proceeds from PPP loans increased demand deposits and the Company’s overall
liquidity as
PPP loan proceeds
waited to be disbursed. Loan growth was lower than deposit growth as customers protected
their liquid positions.
As of December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we had the following available
funding:

Capital Requirements
The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements
administered by the federal banking agencies.
Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory
and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that,
if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements. Refer to Item 1. Business under the
“Supervision and Regulation” section for a detailed discussion regarding
our capital requirements.
The Company monitors our capital ratios using forecasts and stress testing. Based on
our capital ratios in 2020 and 2021 we were
considered well-capitalized. As of December 31, 2021, the FDIC categorized the Bank as “well-capitalized” under
the prompt corrective
action framework. There have been no conditions or events since December 31,
2021 that management believes would change this
classification.
Refer to
Note 13: Regulatory Matters
in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the table that
summarizes the capital
requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank in order to be considered
“well-capitalized” from a regulatory perspective, as well as
the Company’s and the Bank’s capital ratios as of December 31, 2021
and 2020. The Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements
under Basel III and the Bank was considered to be “well-capitalized” for the periods ended
December 31, 2021
and 2020.

Stockholders’ Equity
Prior to our IPO in 2019, the Company’s increase in equity primarily came from
private placements. For the years ended December
31, 2020 and 2021, the Company’s equity increased primarily due
to an increase in net income and changes to the unrealized gain on
available-for-sale securities.
The following graph presents total stockholders’ equity and book value per share as of the end of the periods
indicated:
Changes in stockholders’ equity for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021 are provided in the Consolidated

Interest Rate Sensitivity
A primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Managing interest rate risk is a key element of our balance
sheet
management. Interest rate risk is the risk that net interest margins will be eroded over
time due to changing market conditions. Many factors
can cause margins to erode: (i) lower loan demand; (ii) increased competition
for funds; (iii) weak pricing policies; (iv) balance sheet
mismatches; and (v) changing liquidity demands. We manage our sensitivity position
using our interest rate risk policy. The management of
interest rate risk is a three-step process and involves: (i) measuring the interest
rate risk position; (ii) policy constraints; and (iii) strategic
review and implementation.
Our exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the Bank’s Funds Management
Committee (“FMC”) in accordance with policies
approved by the Bank’s board of directors. The FMC uses a combination of three systems to measure
the balance sheet’s interest rate risk
position. Because each system serves a different purpose and provides a different
perspective, the three systems in combination are expected
to provide a better overall result than a single system alone. The three systems include:
(i) gap reports; (ii) earnings simulation; and (iii)
economic value of equity.
•
A gap report measures the repricing volume of assets and liabilities by time period. The difference between repricing assets and
repricing liabilities for a particular time period is known as the periodic repricing
gap. Using this method, it is possible to estimate
the impact on earnings of a given rate change. As a method of evaluating interest rate risk, the gap report is a reasonably
accurate
method of assessing earnings exposure. However, its reliability diminishes
as balance sheet complexity increases. Optionality and
other factors complicate the analysis.
•
An earnings simulation measures the effect of changing interest rates on net interest
income and earnings. Earnings simulation is
more detailed than gap analysis. Under this approach, the repricing characteristics
of each asset and liability instrument are
programmed into a computer simulation model. This programming allows the Bank
to refine important characteristics such as caps,
floors, and time lag. It also allows the Bank to include the impact of new business
activity in the analysis. Gap reporting only
considers the existing balance sheet position.
•
Economic Value of Equity (“EVE”) is a valuation approach to measuring long-term
interest rate risk exposure. This approach
considers all future time periods, which provides an advantage over earnings
simulation. However, a negative attribute of EVE is
that it assumes a sustained change in rates, which is never the case in the long-term. This seeks to compute
the financial risk of
having a duration mismatch between assets and funding.
In addition, the FMC compares the current interest rate risk position to policy limits. This procedure
is compliance oriented and results
in either a pass or fail outcome. When the balance sheet is in compliance, no further
action is necessary. In instances of noncompliance, the
FMC will develop a plan of action to correct the condition. A summary of the plan and its timing for completion will be forwarded to the
board of directors each quarter until compliance is reestablished.
The FMC also evaluates interest rate risk positioning in light of anticipated
interest rates. The purpose of this comparison is to
determine whether action steps need to be taken to modify current strategy. The results form a decision-making
input for the committee. If it
is determined that more asset sensitivity is needed, the committee will either increase
rate sensitive assets or reduce rate sensitive liabilities.
The opposite will occur if less asset sensitivity is desired.
Loan and deposit repricing assumptions are critical in measuring interest rate risk.
For loans, management reviews spreads and
prepayment assumptions. For deposits, management reviews beta
factors and decay assumptions. The FMC reviews and adjusts repricing
assumptions at least annually. Model assumptions are included in the output
reports and reviewed by the FMC on a periodic basis.
When evaluating balance sheet rate sensitivity, a proper analysis of total funding
is of critical importance. The funding side of the
balance sheet can be segregated into three broad categories, as follows: (i) funding
with defined maturity dates; (ii) non-maturity deposits;
and (iii) perpetual funding.
•
Funding with defined maturity dates includes certificates of deposit and
borrowed funds. The repricing analysis requires a twofold
statement of behavior for each balance sheet category. It requires a cash flow schedule
for principal and interest payments and a
repricing schedule of rate adjustments. Once the cash flow and repricing
projections are developed, the category can be analyzed for
interest rate risk exposure.
•
Non-maturity deposits tend to be a longer term, less volatile source of funds. Non-maturity
deposits have very short contractual
lives. The Bank uses historical analysis to develop its decay assumptions, but it looks at aggregate
account types rather than
individual clients. The review analyzes both non-maturity deposits as a whole and individual
deposit categories.
•
Perpetual funding is the most stable and least costly source of funding. Its main
component is equity capital. It has a zero interest
rate and cannot be withdrawn by stockholders because of a rate change.
In effect, it is a perpetual source of free funding.
To ensure a formal evaluation process, periodic independent evaluations
are conducted and documented. Such evaluation consists
primarily of: (i) an assessment of internal controls; (ii) an evaluation of data
integrity; (iii) the appropriateness of the risk management
system; (iv) the reasonableness of validity scenarios; (v) a review of the
FMC policy; and (vi) validation of calculations. In addition, to
ensure the model is working as expected a back test of the model is completed
at least annually.
All of the assumptions used in our analysis are inherently uncertain and,
as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net
interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest
rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ from
the model’s simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency
of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the
application and timing of various management strategies.
On a quarterly basis, we run various simulation models including a static balance
sheet and dynamic growth balance sheet. These
models test the impact on net interest income and fair value of equity from changes
in market interest rates under various scenarios. Under
the static model and dynamic growth models, rates are shocked instantaneously
and ramped rates change over a 12-month horizon based
upon parallel and nonparallel yield curve shifts. Parallel shock scenarios
assume instantaneous parallel movements in the yield curve
compared to a flat yield curve scenario. Nonparallel simulation involves
analysis of interest income and expense under various changes in the
shape of the yield curve.
Our internal policy regarding internal rate risk simulations currently
specifies that for instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve,
estimated net interest income at risk for the subsequent one-year period
should not decline by more than 5% for a -100 basis point shift, 5%
for a 100 basis point shift, 10% for a 200 basis point shift, 15% for a 300 basis point
shift, and 20% for a 400 basis point shift.
The Company has several instruments that can be used to manage interest rate risk,
including: (i) modifying the duration of interest-
bearing liabilities; (ii) modifying the duration of interest-earning assets, including
our investment portfolio; and (iii) entering into on-balance
sheet derivatives. Based upon the nature of our operations, we are not subject to
foreign exchange or commodity price risk.
The FMC evaluates interest rate risk using a rate shock method and rate
ramp method. In a rate shock analysis, rates change
immediately and the change is sustained over the time horizon. In a rate
ramp analysis, rate changes occur gradually over time. The
following tables summarize the simulated changes in net interest income and
fair value of equity over a 12 month horizon using a rate shock
and rate ramp method as of the dates indicated:

The Company decided to exclude the down rate environment from its analysis due to the already low interest rate environment.
The hypothetical positive change in net interest income as of December
31, 2021 in an up 100 environment is primarily due to
approximately two-thirds of the Company’s earning assets adjusting
within the first year. In addition, the Company’s time deposits and other
borrowings will continue to mature. Increases in the up 100 environment are
impacted by floors on variable rate loans. In an up 200 and 300
environment, floors on variable rate loans become less impactful and
earning assets reprice faster than interest-bearing liabilities. Loans
remain the largest portion of our adjustable earning assets, as the mix of
adjustable loans or those maturing in one year was 76%.
The models the Company uses include assumptions regarding interest
rates and balance changes.
These assumptions are inherently
uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income
or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest
rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of
interest rate changes
as well as changes in market conditions, customer behavior and management
strategies, among other factors.
Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance
with GAAP and with general practices within the financial services
industry. Application of these principles requires management to make complex and subjective estimates and assumptions
that affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our
estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under current circumstances. These assumptions
form the basis for our judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from independent,
objective sources. We evaluate our estimates on an
ongoing basis. Use of alternative assumptions may have resulted in significantly
different estimates. Actual results may differ from these
estimates.
The Company qualifies as an EGC under the JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an EGC can take advantage of the
extended transition period when complying with new or revised accounting
standards. This allows an EGC to delay adoption of certain
accounting standards until those standards would apply to private companies;
however, the EGC can still early adopt new or revised
accounting standards, if applicable. We have elected to take advantage of this extended
transition period, which means the financial
statements in this Form 10-K, as well as financial statements we file in the future,
will be subject to all new or revised accounting standards
generally applicable to private companies, unless stated otherwise. This decision will remain
in effect until the Company loses its EGC
status.
Our most significant accounting policies are described in
Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies
within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We identified the
following accounting policies and estimates that, due to
the difficult, subjective or complex judgments and assumptions inherent
in those policies and estimates and the potential sensitivity of our
financial statements to those judgments and assumptions, are critical to
an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations.

Allowance for Loan Losses:
The ALLL is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit
losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when
management believes the collectability of a loan balance is
unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the
allowance.
The allowance consists of specific and general components.
The specific component relates to loans that are individually
classified as impaired. A loan is considered impaired when,
based on current information and events, it is probable that the
Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the
original contractual terms of the loan agreement. If a loan is
impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan
is reported net at the present value of estimated future cash
flows using the loan’s existing rate or at the fair value of
collateral if repayment is expected solely from the sale of the
collateral.
The general component covers the remaining pool of loans and
is based on historical charge-off experience and expected loss
given default derived from the Company’s internal risk rating
process. Other adjustments may be made to the allowance for
pools of loans after an assessment of internal or external
influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the
historical loss or risk rating data.
The determination of the
Company’s ALLL
contains uncertainties
because it requires
management to make
assumptions and
judgments regarding
future uncollectible
amounts on the loan
portfolio.
Impaired loans may be
impacted by
management's decisions
on the marketability
discount.
The general component
of the ALLL may be
impacted by
management's decisions
on qualitative rates and
loan risk ratings.
Year-end ALLL Balance:
(Dollars in thousands)
2019 - $56,896
2020 - $75,295
2021 - $58,375
Loan Provision:

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company
separated substandard loans into performing and
nonperforming categories that were previously
consolidated. The new approach provided a better estimate
of potential losses inherent in the substandard portfolio.
Besides the change above, the Company has not made any
material changes in the accounting methodology used to
record the ALLL during the past three years.
Based on current applicable GAAP guidance, the Company
does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there
will be a material change in the future estimates or
assumptions used to record the ALLL.
See the Recent Accounting Pronouncements section for an
update regarding Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”)
2016-13 that will impact the accounting methodology used
to record the ALLL.
If actual results are materially different from the judgments
and uncertainties made, the Company would be required to
increase (decrease) its loan provision resulting in a decrease
(increase) in net income.
For example, a 10 basis point increase in our qualitative
factors would increase the provision and related ALLL by
$4 million.

Investment Securities Impairment:
Periodically, the Company may need to assess whether there
have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate
that a security on which there is an unrealized loss is impaired
on an other-than- temporary basis.
In any such instance, the Company would consider many
factors, including the length of time and the extent to which the
fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, the market
liquidity for the security, the financial condition and the near-
term prospects of the issuer, expected cash flows, and our intent
and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient
to recover the temporary loss. Securities on which there is an
unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary
are
written down to fair value, with the write-down recorded as a
realized loss in securities gains (losses).
The determination of an
investment impairment
contains uncertainties
because it requires
management to make
assumptions and
judgments regarding
future uncollectible
amounts based on
investments that have a
lower market value than
book value within the
security portfolio.
During 2021, an equity
security acquired in
partial satisfaction of
debts previously
contracted was sold at a
loss of $6 million.
The Company has not made any material changes in the
accounting methodology used to evaluate whether an
investment is other-than-temporarily impaired during the
past three years.
Based on current applicable GAAP guidance, the Company
does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there
will be a material change in the future estimates or
assumptions used to record impaired securities.
See the Recent Accounting Pronouncements section for an
update regarding ASU 2016-13 that will impact the
accounting methodology used to record other-than-
temporary impairments on securities.
If actual results are materially different from the judgments
and uncertainties made, the Company would be required to
impair the associated securities, resulting in a decline in net
income, other comprehensive income, or both.

Deferred Tax Asset:
The Company accounts for income taxes in
accordance with income tax accounting
guidance. Accordingly, we record a net
deferred tax asset or liability based on the tax
effects of the differences between the
book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. If
currently available information indicates it is
“more likely than not” that the net deferred
tax asset will not be realized, a valuation
allowance is established. Net deferred tax
assets are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled.
The Company exercises significant
judgment in evaluating the amount
and timing of recognition of the
resulting tax liabilities and assets.
These judgments and estimates are
inherently subjective and reviewed
on a continual basis as regulatory
and business factors change. Any
reduction in estimated future
taxable income may require us to
record a valuation allowance
against our new deferred tax asset.
A valuation allowance would result
in additional income tax expense in
such period, which would
negatively affect earnings.
Effective Tax Rate:
2019: 13%
2020: 18%
2021: 20%
The Company is subject to various state tax rates that impact the
overall effective tax rate. Changes in income earned in various
states may increase or decrease the effective tax rate in the future.
Based on current applicable GAAP guidance, the Company does
not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a
material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to
record the deferred tax asset.
In the event the Company was required to change the effective tax
rate used to calculate the deferred tax asset, a rate decrease would
result in a lower deferred tax asset and net income while a rate
increase would result in a higher deferred tax asset and net income.
For example, if the effective tax rate was reduced by 1% as of
December 31, 2021, a $779 thousand decrease in our deferred tax
asset and an increase to the Company's tax expense of the same
amount would occur.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement
defines fair value as the price that would be
received to sell a financial asset or paid to
transfer a financial liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at
the measurement date.
The degree of management
judgment involved in determining
the fair value of assets and
liabilities is dependent upon the
availability of quoted market prices
or observable market parameters.
For financial instruments that trade
actively and have quoted market
prices or observable market
parameters, there is minimal
subjectivity involved in measuring
fair value. When observable market
prices and parameters are not
available, management judgment is
necessary to estimate fair value. In
addition, changes in market
conditions may reduce the
availability of quoted prices or the
observable date.
The Company has not made any material changes in the accounting
methodology used to evaluate the fair market value of assets or
liabilities when observable market prices and parameters are not
available and management judgment is necessary.
Based on current applicable GAAP guidance, the Company does
not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a
material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to
record the fair market value of assets and liabilities.
The Company’s investment portfolio, derivatives, impaired loans,
assets held-for-sale and foreclosed assets require management’s
judgment to determine the asset’s value.
In the event the Company was required to decrease (increase) the
investment portfolio’s fair value, the result would be a decline
(increase) in total assets, OCI, and AOCI.
Impaired loans impact the ALLL. See the ALLL discussion above.
