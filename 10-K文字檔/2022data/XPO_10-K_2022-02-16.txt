ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
XPO Logistics is a leading provider of freight transportation services. We use our proprietary technology to move goods efficiently through our customers’ supply chains, primarily by providing less-than-truckload (“LTL”) and truck brokerage services. These two core lines of business generated the majority of our 2021 revenue and operating income.
Our company has two reportable segments - (i) North American LTL and (ii) Brokerage and Other Services - and within each segment, we are a leading provider in vast, fragmented transportation sectors with growing penetration. We believe that our substantial exposure to secular industry growth trends, our first-mover advantage as an innovator and our blue-chip customer relationships are compelling competitive advantages.
On August 2, 2021, we completed the previously announced spin-off of our Logistics segment in a transaction intended to qualify as tax-free to XPO and our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which was accomplished by the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common stock of GXO Logistics, Inc. (“GXO”) to XPO stockholders. XPO stockholders received one share of GXO common stock for every share of XPO common stock held at the close of business on July 23, 2021, the record date for the distribution. XPO does not beneficially own any shares of GXO’s common stock following the spin-off. GXO is an independent public company trading under the symbol “GXO” on the New York Stock Exchange. The historical results of GXO are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.
Impacts of COVID-19 and Supply Chain Challenges
As a leading provider of freight transportation services, our business can be impacted to varying degrees by factors beyond our control. The COVID-19 pandemic that emerged in 2020 affected, and may continue to affect, economic activity broadly and customer sectors served by our industry.
The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated impacts on economic activity had adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition beginning in the second quarter of 2020 and continued throughout the year. The rebound of our business began to occur midway through 2020; however, as the economy recovers, demand has outpaced supply in certain sectors. Additionally, labor shortages in the recovery - notably, a reduced supply of truck drivers - present challenges to many service industries, including freight transportation. These dynamics, together with equipment shortages and pent-up demand for semiconductor chips used by some of our end markets, have created supply chain disruptions and increased our cost of transportation and services. We cannot predict how long the current labor shortages and other disruptions will last, or whether future disruptions, if any, will adversely affect our results of operations.
We continue to incur net incremental and direct costs related to COVID-19 to ensure that we meet the needs of our employees and customers; these include costs for personal protective equipment (“PPE”), site cleanings and enhanced employee benefits, referred to as COVID-19-related costs in this Annual Report.
The totality of the actions we have taken during the pandemic, and continue to take, have mitigated the impact on our profitability relative to the impact on our revenue and volumes, while our strong liquidity and disciplined capital management enable us to continue to invest in key growth initiatives.
Impact of Inflation
Inflation can have a negative impact on our operating costs. A prolonged period of inflation could cause interest rates, fuel, wages and other costs to increase, which would adversely affect our results of operations unless our pricing to our customers correspondingly increases. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the constrained labor market resulted in higher third-party transportation and fuel costs to meet growing demand which were partially offset by increased pricing to our customers.
Consolidated Summary Financial Results
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2020
Our consolidated revenue for 2021 increased by 25.6% to $12.8 billion, from $10.2 billion in 2020. The increase primarily reflects growth in both our LTL and truck brokerage businesses and the negative impact of COVID-19 in 2020, which decreased demand for our services. Foreign currency movement increased revenue by approximately 0.9 percentage points in 2021.
Cost of transportation and services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) includes the cost of providing or procuring freight transportation for XPO customers and salaries paid to employee drivers in our LTL and truck brokerage businesses.
Cost of transportation and services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) in 2021 was $8.9 billion, or 69.9% of revenue, compared with $7.0 billion, or 68.1% of revenue in 2020. The year-over-year increase as a percentage of revenue reflects the constrained labor market, which resulted in higher third-party transportation costs. These increases were partially offset by lower compensation-related costs, including COVID-19-related costs.
Direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) are comprised of both fixed and variable expenses and consist of operating costs related to our LTL service centers. Direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) consist mainly of personnel costs, facility and equipment expenses, such as rent, utilities, equipment maintenance and repair, costs of materials and supplies, information technology expenses, and gains and losses on sales of property and equipment.
Direct operating expense (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) in 2021 was $1.4 billion, or 10.9% of revenue, compared with $1.2 billion, or 12.1% of revenue, in 2020. The year-over-year decrease as a percentage of revenue was primarily driven by lower COVID-19 related costs as well as the leveraging of compensation and facilities costs
across a larger revenue base. Additionally, 2021 and 2020 included $73 million and $90 million, respectively, from gains on sales of property and equipment.
Sales, general and administrative expense (“SG&A”) primarily consists of salaries and commissions for the sales function, salary and benefit costs for executive and certain administration functions, professional fees, facility costs, bad debt expense and legal costs.
SG&A was $1.3 billion in 2021, or 10.3% of revenue, compared with $1.2 billion, or 11.9% of revenue, in 2020. The year-over-year decrease in SG&A as a percentage of revenue was primarily driven by lower self-insurance expense, compensation costs, bad debt expense and third-party professional fees, as well as lower COVID-19-related costs. These impacts were partially offset by higher employee healthcare costs and legal costs, including $31 million incurred in 2021 related to settlements in connection with classification of independent contractors at our intermodal drayage business unit. See Note 18-Commitments and Contingencies to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Depreciation and amortization expense in 2021 was $476 million, compared with $470 million in 2020.
Transaction and integration costs in 2021 were $37 million, compared with $75 million in 2020. Transaction and integration costs for 2021 and 2020 are primarily comprised of third-party professional fees related to strategic initiatives, including the spin-off of the Logistics segment, as well as retention awards paid to certain employees. Additionally, transaction and integration costs for 2020 included professional fees related to our previously announced exploration of strategic alternatives that was terminated in March 2020.
Restructuring costs in 2021 were $19 million, compared with $31 million in 2020. We engage in restructuring actions as part of our ongoing efforts to best use our resources and infrastructure, including actions in connection with our spin-off and in response to COVID-19. For more information, see Note 6-Restructuring Charges to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Upon successful completion of the restructuring initiatives recorded in 2021, we expect to achieve annualized pre-tax run-rate savings of approximately $25 million by the end of 2022.
Other income primarily consists of pension income. Other income for 2021 was $57 million, compared with $41 million in 2020. The year-over-year increase reflects $15 million of higher net periodic pension income in 2021.
Foreign currency (gain) loss was a $2 million gain in 2021, compared with a $3 million gain in 2020. Foreign currency (gain) loss in 2021 primarily reflected a realized gain on de-designated cross-currency contract. Foreign currency gain in 2020 primarily reflected unrealized gains on foreign currency option and forward contracts and a realized gain on a terminated net investment hedge, partially offset by foreign currency transaction and measurement losses. For additional information on our foreign currency option and forward contracts, see Note 11-Derivative Instruments to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Debt extinguishment loss was $54 million in 2021. In 2021, we redeemed our outstanding senior notes due 2022, 2023 and 2024 and wrote-off related debt issuance costs, incurred a pre-payment penalty on the redemption of the 2024 senior notes and incurred costs related to the amendment of our term loan credit agreement. There were no debt extinguishment losses in 2020.
Interest expense for 2021 decreased 31.3% to $211 million, from $307 million in 2020. The decrease in interest expense reflected the lower average debt balances, including the redemption of our senior notes and amendment of our term loan agreement.
Our consolidated income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes in 2021 was income of $410 million, compared with a loss of $35 million in 2020. The increase primarily was driven by higher operating income and lower interest expense, partially offset by the debt extinguishment loss recorded in 2021. With respect to our U.S. operations, income from continuing operations before income taxes was income of $420 million in 2021, compared with income of $45 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher revenue, in part from the negative impact of COVID-19 on our 2020 results, partially offset by higher third-party transportation, fuel and personnel costs. Additionally impacting the increase was lower interest expense, partially offset by the debt extinguishment loss recorded in 2021. With respect to our non-U.S. operations, loss from continuing operations
before income taxes was $10 million in 2021, compared with a loss of $80 million in 2020. The decrease in the loss was primarily due to higher revenues, in part from the negative impact of COVID-19 on our 2020 results, partially offset by higher third-party transportation, fuel and personnel costs.
Our effective income tax rates were 21.3% and 63.4% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by reduced contribution and margin-based taxes coupled with increased pre-tax book income and the impact of discrete items. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our effective tax rate was impacted by discrete tax benefits of $45 million related to a tax planning initiative that resulted in the recognition of a long-term capital loss partially offset by discrete tax expenses of $39 million related to foreign valuation allowances, of which $34 million of the valuation allowances were transferred to GXO. Additionally, impacting the year ended December 31, 2021, were $8 million of non-deductible compensation, discrete tax benefits of $8 million resulting from changes in reserves for uncertain tax positions and discrete tax benefits of $6 million related to stock-based compensation.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our effective tax rate was impacted primarily by a pre-tax book loss, $8 million of contribution and margin-based taxes, foreign rate differential benefit of $3 million, discrete tax benefits of $15 million related to stock-based compensation and $6 million of discrete tax benefits related to provision to return adjustments, partially offset by a discrete tax expense of $4 million related to changes in reserves for uncertain tax positions.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2019
Our consolidated revenue for 2020 decreased by 4.5% to $10.2 billion, from $10.7 billion in 2019. The decline in revenue primarily reflected the impact of COVID-19 and lower fuel revenue. Foreign currency movement increased revenue by approximately 0.4 percentage points in 2020.
Cost of transportation and services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) in 2020 was $7.0 billion, or 68.1% of revenue, compared with $7.4 billion, or 68.9% of revenue in 2019. The year-over-year decrease as a percentage of revenue reflects lower fuel costs, partially offset by higher third-party transportation costs and incremental PPE and other COVID-19-related costs.
Direct operating expense (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) in 2020 was $1.2 billion, or 12.1% of revenue, compared with $1.2 billion, or 11.1% of revenue, in 2019. The year-over-year increase as a percentage of revenue was primarily driven by higher facility and payroll costs and incremental PPE and other COVID-19-related costs. Additionally, 2020 and 2019 included $90 million and $101 million, respectively, from gains on sales of property and equipment.
SG&A was $1.2 billion in 2020, or 11.9% of revenue, compared with $1.1 billion, or 10.0% of revenue, in 2019. The year-over-year increase in SG&A as a percentage of revenue was primarily driven by higher compensation costs, increased self-insurance and bad debt expense and incremental PPE and other COVID-19-related costs. Compensation costs were higher in 2020 compared to the prior year due to the strength of our operating performance in a challenging macro-environment.
Depreciation and amortization expense in 2020 was $470 million, compared with $467 million in 2019.
Transaction and integration costs in 2020 were $75 million, compared with $5 million in 2019. Transaction and integration costs for 2020 are primarily related to our previously announced exploration of strategic alternatives that was terminated in March 2020.
Restructuring costs in 2020 were $31 million, compared with $35 million in 2019. We engage in restructuring actions as part of our ongoing efforts to best use our resources and infrastructure, including actions in response to COVID-19.
Other income primarily consists of pension income. Other income for 2020 was $41 million, compared with $23 million in 2019. The year-over-year increase reflects $21 million of higher net periodic pension income in 2020.
Foreign currency (gain) loss was a $3 million gain in 2020, compared with a $10 million loss in 2019. Foreign currency gain in 2020 primarily reflected unrealized gains on foreign currency option and forward contracts and a realized gain on a terminated net investment hedge, partially offset by foreign currency transaction and measurement losses. Foreign currency loss in 2019 primarily reflected unrealized losses on foreign currency option and forward contracts.
Debt extinguishment loss was $5 million in 2019 and related to the write-off of debt issuance costs for an unsecured credit facility (“Unsecured Credit Facility”) that was repaid in 2019. There were no debt extinguishment losses in 2020.
Interest expense for 2020 increased 14.6% to $307 million, from $268 million in 2019. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher average total indebtedness, including the senior notes due 2025 (the “Senior Notes due 2025”) that were issued in the second quarter of 2020, partially offset by lower interest rates in 2020.
Our consolidated income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes in 2020 was a loss of $35 million, compared with income of $301 million in 2019. The decrease primarily was driven by lower operating income and higher interest expense, partially offset by higher other income. With respect to our U.S. operations, income from continuing operations before income taxes was $45 million, compared with income of $286 million in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and higher interest expense. With respect to our non-U.S. operations, loss from continuing operations before income taxes was $80 million in 2020, compared to income of $15 million in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of COVID-19.
Our effective income tax rates were 63.4% and 19.7% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily driven by a significant reduction in pre-tax book income and discrete items. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our effective tax rate was impacted primarily by a pre-tax book loss, $8 million of contribution and margin-based taxes, foreign rate differential benefit of $3 million, discrete tax benefits of $15 million related to stock-based compensation and $6 million of discrete tax benefits related to provision to return adjustments, partially offset by a discrete tax expense of $4 million related to changes in reserves for uncertain tax positions. Contribution and margin-based tax expense did not materially change for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year. However, these items had a significant impact on the Company’s 2020 effective tax rate, primarily due to the pre-tax book loss in 2020 as compared to higher pre-tax book income in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our effective tax rate was impacted by $8 million of contribution and margin-based taxes offset by discrete tax benefits of $5 million related to changes in reserves for uncertain tax positions.
The U.S. Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) enacted in March 2020 provided numerous tax provisions and other stimulus measures, including temporary changes regarding the prior and future utilization of net operating losses, temporary changes to the prior and future limitations on interest deductions, and technical corrections from prior tax legislation for tax depreciation of certain qualified improvement property. We applied the provisions of the CARES Act relating to income taxes and realized a $4 million reduction in cash taxes as well as an immaterial income tax benefit on our Consolidated Statements of Income in 2020. Additionally, we benefited from the ability to defer the payment of certain payroll taxes that would otherwise have been required in 2020. We have not applied for any government loans under the CARES Act or similar laws.
Segment Financial Results
Our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) regularly reviews financial information at the operating segment level to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance. Our CODM evaluates segment profit (loss) based on adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), which we define as income (loss) from continuing operations before debt extinguishment loss, interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization expense, litigation settlements for significant matters, transaction and integration costs, restructuring costs and other adjustments. See Note 4-Segment Reporting and Geographic Information for further information and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Income (loss) from continuing operations.
North American Less-Than-Truckload Segment
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2020
Revenue in our North American LTL segment increased 16.4% to $4.1 billion in 2021, compared with $3.5 billion in 2020. Revenue included fuel surcharge revenue of $632 million and $433 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
We evaluate the revenue performance of our LTL business using several commonly used metrics, including volume (weight per day in pounds) and yield, which is a commonly used measure of LTL pricing trends. We measure yield using gross revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges. Impacts on yield can include weight per shipment and length of haul, among other factors. The following table summarizes our key revenue metrics:
The year-over-year increase in revenue for 2021 reflects an increase in average weight per day and gross revenue per hundredweight. The increase in weight per day for 2021 reflects higher shipments per day and weight per shipment.
Adjusted EBITDA was $904 million, or 21.9% of revenue, in 2021, compared with $764 million, or 21.6% of revenue, in 2020. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by higher revenue and pension income, partially offset by higher personnel, third-party transportation and fuel costs. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA for 2021 included lower year-over-year gains from real estate transactions, including a $62 million gain in 2021, compared with $77 million in 2020.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2019
Revenue in our North American LTL segment decreased 6.6% to $3.5 billion in 2020, compared with $3.8 billion in 2019. Revenue included fuel surcharge revenue of $433 million and $532 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The decline in revenue reflected the impact of COVID-19.
The following table summarizes our key revenue metrics:
The year-over-year decrease in revenue for 2020 reflects a decrease in average weight per day in part due to COVID-19, partially offset by an increase in gross revenue per hundredweight. The decrease in weight per day reflects lower shipments per day and weight per shipment.
Adjusted EBITDA was $764 million, or 21.6% of revenue, in 2020, compared with $851 million, or 22.4% of revenue, in 2019. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by lower revenue and higher facility costs, partially offset by lower fuel, third-party transportation and personnel costs, as well as higher pension income. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA included $77 million and $88 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, of gains from real estate transactions.
Brokerage and Other Services Segment
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2020
Revenue in our Brokerage and Other Services segment increased 31.0% to $8.9 billion in 2021, compared with $6.8 billion in 2020. The increase in revenue compared to 2020 reflects an increase in North American truck brokerage loads per day facilitated by our digital platform, as well as strength in other brokerage services, in part due to improving market conditions in the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. These gains were partially offset by the impact of the global semiconductor shortage, which constrained customer demand for freight transportation services in North America and Europe. Foreign currency movement increased revenue by approximately 1.4 percentage points in 2021.
Adjusted EBITDA was $547 million, or 6.1% of revenue in 2021, compared with $284 million, or 4.2% of revenue, in 2020. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by higher revenue due to load growth and strong pricing in other brokerage services, partially offset by higher compensation and facilities costs.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2019
Revenue in our Brokerage and Other Services segment decreased 3.4% to $6.8 billion in 2020, compared with $7.0 billion in 2019. The decline in revenue primarily reflected the impact of COVID-19 and lower fuel revenue. Foreign currency movement increased revenue by approximately 0.7 percentage points in 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA was $284 million, or 4.2% of revenue in 2020, compared with $406 million, or 5.8% of revenue, in 2019. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by lower revenue, partially offset by lower third-party transportation, fuel and personnel costs. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2019 included $6 million related to the impairment of customer relationship intangible assets associated with exiting the direct postal injection business.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal existing sources of cash are (i) cash generated from operations; (ii) borrowings available under our Second Amended and Restated Revolving Loan Credit Agreement, as amended (the “ABL Facility”); and (iii) proceeds from the issuance of other debt. As of December 31, 2021, we have $995 million available to draw under our ABL Facility, based on a borrowing base of $1.0 billion and outstanding letters of credit of $5 million. Additionally, under a credit agreement, we have a $200 million uncommitted secured evergreen letter of credit facility, under which we have issued $198 million in aggregate face amount of letters of credit as of December 31, 2021.
In July 2021, we amended our existing ABL facility which matures in April 2024 to reduce the commitments from $1.1 billion to $1.0 billion. There were no other significant changes made to the terms of the facility, including the maturity date, the interest rate margin, and financial covenants.
Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $260 million as of December 31, 2021, compared to $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2020. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents is largely due to the repayment of debt in 2021 described below.
We continually evaluate our liquidity requirements in light of our operating needs, growth initiatives and capital resources. We believe that our existing liquidity and sources of capital are sufficient to support our operations over the next 12 months.
Trade Receivables Securitization and Factoring Programs
We sell certain of our trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions under factoring agreements. We account for these transactions as sales of receivables and present cash proceeds as cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We also sell trade accounts receivable under a securitization program described below. We use trade receivables securitization and factoring programs to help manage our cash flows and offset the impact of extended payment terms for some of our customers.
Our European business participates in a trade receivables securitization program co-arranged by two European banks (the “Purchasers”). Under the program, a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity of XPO sells trade receivables that originate with wholly-owned subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and France to unaffiliated entities managed by the Purchasers. The special purpose entity is a variable interest entity and is consolidated by XPO based on our control of the entity’s activities. The program expires in July 2024.
We account for transfers under our securitization and factoring arrangements as sales because we sell full title and ownership in the underlying receivables and control of the receivables is considered transferred. For these transfers, the receivables are removed from our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the date of transfer. The fair value of any servicing assets and liabilities is immaterial. Our trade receivables securitization program permits us to borrow, on an unsecured basis, cash collected in a servicing capacity on previously sold receivables, which we report within short-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The maximum amount of net cash proceeds available at any one time under the securitization program, inclusive of any unsecured borrowings, is €200 million (approximately $227 million as of December 31, 2021). Prior to July 2021, when the securitization program was amended in connection with the spin-off, the maximum amount available was €400 million. As of December 31, 2021, the maximum amount available under the program was utilized.
Under the current program, we service the receivables we sell on behalf of the Purchasers, which gives us visibility into the timing of customer payments. The benefit to our cash flow includes the difference between the cash consideration in the table below and the amount we collected as a servicer on behalf of the Purchasers. In 2021 and 2020, we collected cash as servicer of $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.
Information related to the trade receivables sold was as follows:
(1) Information for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 exclude the impact of the Logistics segment.
In addition to the cash considerations referenced above, we received $75 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, for the realization of cash on the deferred purchase price receivable for our prior securitization program.
Letters of Credit Facility
In 2020, we entered into a credit agreement that contained a $200 million uncommitted secured evergreen letter of credit facility. The letter of credit facility had an initial one-year term, which automatically renewed for an additional year, and may automatically renew with one-year terms until the letter of credit facility terminates. As of December 31, 2021, we have issued $198 million in aggregate face amount of letters of credit. The credit agreement governing the letter of credit facility contains representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type as well as customary events of default.
Term Loan Facilities
In 2021, we amended our senior secured term loan credit agreement (the “Term Loan Credit Agreement”) to consolidate our tranches and lower the interest rate. We recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $3 million in 2021 due to this amendment. In March 2019, we entered into an amendment to our Term Loan Credit Agreement and borrowed an additional $500 million of incremental loans under a new tranche of term loans. Proceeds from the new tranche of loans were used for general corporate purposes, including funding purchases of our common stock as described in Note 14-Stockholders’ Equity. For more information on these amendments, refer to Note 12-Debt to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Senior Notes
In the third quarter of 2021, we redeemed our outstanding 6.125% senior notes due 2023 (“Senior Notes due 2023”) and our outstanding 6.75% senior notes due 2024 (“Senior Notes due 2024”). The Senior Notes due 2024 were originally issued in 2019 and the proceeds were used to repay our outstanding obligation under the Unsecured Credit Facility described below and to finance a portion of our share repurchases described in Note 14-Stockholders’ Equity. The redemption price for the Senior Notes due 2023 was 100.0% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and the redemption price for the Senior Notes due 2024 was 103.375% of the principle amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We paid for the redemption using cash received from GXO of approximately $794 million, proceeds from an equity offering described in Note 14-Stockholders’ Equity and available cash. We recorded debt extinguishment losses of $3 million and $43 million in 2021 related to the redemption of the Senior Notes due 2023 and Senior Notes due 2024, respectively.
In January 2021, we redeemed our outstanding 6.50% senior notes due 2022 (“Senior Notes due 2022”) that were originally issued in 2015. The redemption price for the notes was 100.0% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We paid for the redemption with available cash, including the net proceeds from the issuance of our 6.25% senior notes due 2025 (“Senior Notes due 2025”) as described below. We recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $5 million in 2021 due to this redemption.
In 2020, we completed private placements of $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2025. Net proceeds from the notes were initially invested in cash and cash equivalents and were subsequently used in 2021 to redeem our outstanding Senior Notes due 2022 as described above.
In February 2019, we completed a private placement of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes due 2024. We used the proceeds from the Senior Notes due 2024 to repay our outstanding obligation under the Unsecured Credit Facility described below and to finance a portion of our share repurchases described in Note 14-Stockholders’ Equity to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Unsecured Credit Facility
In December 2018, we entered into a $500 million Unsecured Credit Facility and borrowed $250 million. We borrowed an additional $250 million in January 2019. We used the proceeds of both borrowings to finance a portion of our share repurchases described in Note 14-Stockholders’ Equity to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with the issuance of the Senior Notes due 2024 described above, we repaid our outstanding obligations under the Unsecured Credit Facility and terminated it in February 2019. We recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $5 million in 2019 in connection with this repayment.
Preferred Stock and Warrant Exchanges
In December 2020, some holders of our convertible preferred stock exchanged their holdings for a combination of our common stock, based on the stated conversion price, and a lump-sum payment that represents an approximation of the net present value of the future dividends payable on the preferred stock. Additionally, some holders of our warrants exchanged (or committed to exchange subject to the satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions) their holdings, including Jacobs Private Equity, LLC (“JPE”), an entity controlled by the Company’s chairman and chief executive officer, for a number of shares of our common stock equal to the number of shares of common stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon an exercise of the warrants less the number of shares of common stock that have an approximate value equal to the exercise price of the warrants. With respect to the preferred stock, through December 31, 2020, 69,445 shares were exchanged, and we issued 9.9 million shares of common stock and paid $22 million of cash. The $22 million was reflected as a preferred stock conversion charge in 2020 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. With respect to the warrants, through December 31, 2020, 0.3 million warrants were exchanged, and we issued 0.3 million shares of common stock.
In 2021, the remaining 1,015 preferred shares were exchanged, and we issued 0.1 million shares of common stock. With respect to the warrants, in 2021, 9.8 million warrants were exchanged, and we issued 9.2 million shares of common stock. These exchanges were intended to simplify our equity capital structure, including in contemplation of the spin-off of our Logistics segment. As of December 31, 2021, there were no shares of preferred stock or warrants outstanding.
Share Repurchases
In December 2018, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our common stock, which was completed in the first quarter of 2019. The share repurchases were funded by our Unsecured Credit Facility and available cash.
In February 2019, our Board of Directors authorized additional repurchases of up to $1.5 billion of our common stock. The 2019 authorization permits us to purchase shares in both the open market and in private transactions, with the timing and number of shares dependent on a variety of factors, including price, general business conditions, market conditions, alternative investment opportunities and funding considerations. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares and may suspend or discontinue the program at any time. The share purchases under this program have been funded by our available cash and proceeds from our 2019 debt offerings.
There were no share repurchases in 2021. Our remaining share repurchase authorization as of December 31, 2021 is $503 million. Information regarding our shares repurchased, based on settlement date, in 2020 and 2019 were as follows:
Loan Covenants and Compliance
As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of our debt agreements. Any failure to comply with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.
LIBOR
Uncertainty related to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) phase-out by June 2023 for USD LIBOR with greater than two-month maturities may adversely impact the value of, and our obligations under, our ABL and term loan facilities. See the applicable discussion under Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Sources and Uses of Cash
Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities from continuing operations, as reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, are summarized as follows:
During 2021, we: (i) generated cash from operating activities from continuing operations of $656 million; (ii) generated proceeds from sales of property and equipment of $132 million; (iii) received a distribution from GXO of $794 million and (iv) generated proceeds of $384 million from the issuance of common stock. We used cash during this period primarily to: (i) purchase property and equipment of $313 million; (ii) redeem our senior notes due 2022, 2023 and 2024 for $2.8 billion; (iii) repay our ABL Facility borrowings of $200 million and (iv) make payments on debt and finance leases of $80 million.
During 2020, we: (i) generated cash from operating activities from continuing operations of $388 million; (ii) generated proceeds from sales of property and equipment (primarily real estate) of $183 million and (iii) received net proceeds of $1.4 billion from our issuances of debt and short-term borrowings. We used cash during this period primarily to: (i) purchase property and equipment of $303 million; (ii) repurchase common stock of $114 million and (iii) make payments on debt and finance leases of $65 million.
Cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations for 2021 increased by $268 million compared with 2020. The increase reflects higher income from continuing operations of $336 million for 2021 compared with the same period in 2020, partially offset by greater use of cash for working capital in 2021 than in the prior-year period. Additionally, cash paid for taxes was $44 million higher in 2021 compared to 2020.
Cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations for 2020 decreased by $241 million compared with 2019. The decrease reflects lower income from continuing operations, partially offset by the impact of operating assets and liabilities utilizing $84 million less cash in 2020. Within operating assets and liabilities, accrued expenses and other liabilities was a source of cash for 2020 as compared to a use of cash in 2019. This fluctuation primarily reflects the deferral of certain tax payments and an increase in compensation and purchased transportation accruals in 2020. Partially offsetting the impact of accrued expenses and other liabilities was the higher use of cash due to increased accounts receivable as a result of higher revenues in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 2019.
As of December 31, 2021, we had $1.1 billion of operating lease and related interest payment obligations, of which $206 million is due within the next twelve months. Additionally, we had operating leases that have not yet commenced with future undiscounted lease payments of $11 million. These operating leases will commence in 2022 with initial lease terms of 3 years to 7 years. For further information on our operating leases and their maturities, see Note 8-Leases to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Investing activities from continuing operations used $184 million of cash in 2021 compared with $116 million used in 2020 and $67 million used in 2019. During 2021, we used $313 million of cash to purchase property and equipment and received $132 million from sales of property and equipment. During 2020, we used $303 million of cash to purchase property and equipment and received $183 million of cash from sales of property and equipment. During 2019, we used $379 million of cash to purchase property and equipment, received $237 million of cash from
sales of property and equipment and received proceeds of $75 million related to the realization of cash on deferred purchase price receivable. We anticipate net capital expenditures to be between $425 million and $475 million in 2022, funded by cash on hand and available liquidity.
Financing activities from continuing operations used $1.9 billion of cash in 2021 compared with $1.2 billion of cash generated in 2020 and $201 million used in 2019. The primary uses of cash from financing activities from continuing operations during 2021 were $2.8 billion used to redeem the senior notes due 2022, 2023 and 2024 and $200 million used to repay borrowings under our ABL Facility. The primary sources of cash from financing activities from continuing operations during 2021 were $794 million of proceeds from a distribution from GXO and $384 million of net proceeds from our common offering. In July 2021, GXO completed a debt offering and used the net proceeds to fund a cash payment from GXO to XPO. The primary sources of cash from financing activities from continuing operations in 2020 were $1.1 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes due 2025; $200 million of proceeds from borrowings on our ABL Facility, net of payments, and $23 million from net borrowings related to our securitization program. The primary uses of cash from financing activities from continuing operations in 2020 were $114 million used to repurchase XPO common stock and $65 million used to repay debt and finance leases. The primary uses of cash from financing activities from continuing operations in 2019 were $1.3 billion to repurchase XPO common stock and $569 million used to repay debt and finance leases. The primary source of cash from financing activities from continuing operations in 2019 was $1.7 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt.
As of December 31, 2021, we had $3.5 billion total outstanding principal amount of debt, excluding finance leases. We have no significant debt maturities until 2025. Interest on our ABL and Term Loan facilities are variable, while interest on our senior notes are at fixed rates. Future interest payments associated with our debt total $623 million at December 31, 2021, with $130 million payable within 12 months, and are estimated based on the principal amount of debt and applicable interest rates as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, as of December 31, 2021, we have $255 million of finance lease and related interest payment obligations, of which $61 million is due within the next twelve months. For further information on our debt facilities and maturities, see Note 12-Debt to our Consolidated Financial Statements. For further information on our finance lease maturities, see Note 8-Leases to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Defined Benefit Pension Plans
We sponsor both funded and unfunded defined benefit plans for some employees in the U.S. Historically, we have realized income, rather than expense, from these plans. We generated aggregate income from our plans of $61 million in 2021, $48 million in 2020 and $24 million in 2019. The plans have been generating income due to their funded status and because they do not allow for new plan participants or additional benefit accruals.
Defined benefit pension plan amounts are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. Assumptions include discount rates, inflation rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. The assumptions used in recording the projected benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets represent our best estimates based on available information regarding historical experience and factors that may cause future expectations to differ. Differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could materially impact our obligation and future expense or income.
Discount Rate
In determining the appropriate discount rate, we are assisted by actuaries who utilize a yield-curve model based on a universe of high-grade corporate bonds (rated AA or better by Moody’s, S&P or Fitch rating services). The model determines a single equivalent discount rate by applying the yield curve to expected future benefit payments.
The discount rates used in determining the net periodic benefit costs and benefit obligations are as follows:
An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would decrease or increase our 2021 pre-tax pension income by approximately $3 million.
We use a full yield curve approach to estimate the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to each of the underlying projected cash flows based on time until payment.
Rate of Return on Plan Assets
We estimate the expected return on plan assets using current market data as well as historical returns. The expected return on plan assets is based on estimates of long-term returns and considers the plans’ anticipated asset allocation over the course of the next year. The plan assets are managed using a long-term liability-driven investment strategy that seeks to mitigate the funded status volatility by increasing participation in fixed-income investments generally as funded status increases. This strategy was developed by analyzing a variety of diversified asset-class combinations in conjunction with the projected liabilities of the plans.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, our expected return on plan assets was $101 million, compared to the actual return on plan assets of $25 million. The actual annualized return on plan assets for 2021 was approximately 1%, which was below the expected return on asset assumption for the year due to negative performance in a long duration fixed income market environment, which represented 86% of the portfolio, partially offset by positive performance from the domestic and international equity markets. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the expected return on plan assets would increase or decrease our 2021 pre-tax pension income by approximately $5 million.
Actuarial Gains and Losses
Changes in the discount rate and/or differences between the expected and actual rate of return on plan assets results in unrecognized actuarial gains or losses. For our defined benefit pension plans, accumulated unrecognized actuarial losses were $43 million as of December 31, 2021. The portion of the unrecognized actuarial gain/loss that exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year is amortized and recognized as income/expense over the estimated average remaining life expectancy of plan participants.
Effect on Results
The effects of the defined benefit pension plans on our results consist primarily of the net effect of the interest cost on plan obligations and the expected return on plan assets. We estimate that the defined benefit pension plans will contribute annual pre-tax income in 2022 of $60 million.
Funding
In determining the amount and timing of pension contributions, we consider our cash position, the funded status as measured by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and generally accepted accounting principles, and the tax deductibility of contributions, among other factors. We contributed $6 million in 2021 and 2020 to the non-qualified plans, respectively, and we estimate that we will contribute $5 million in 2022.
For additional information, see Note 13-Employee Benefit Plans to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in Note 2-Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The methods, assumptions, and estimates that we use in applying our accounting policies may require us to apply judgments regarding matters that are inherently uncertain and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis. Material changes in these assumptions, estimates and/or judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations. We have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates and/or judgments. Although actual results may differ from estimated results, we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate.
Evaluation of Goodwill
We measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. We allocate goodwill to our reporting units for the purpose of impairment testing. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates an impairment loss may have been incurred. We measure goodwill impairment, if any, at the amount a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. Our reporting units are our operating segments or one level below our operating segments for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, the assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and a determination of the fair value of each reporting unit.
Accounting guidance allows entities to perform a qualitative assessment (a “step-zero” test) before performing a quantitative analysis. If an entity determines that it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the entity does not need to perform a quantitative analysis for that reporting unit. The qualitative assessment includes a review of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, internal cost factors, and overall financial performance, among other factors.
For our 2021 goodwill assessment, we performed a step-zero qualitative analysis for our three reporting units. Based on the qualitative assessments performed, we concluded that it was not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was less than their carrying amounts and, therefore, further quantitative analysis was not performed, and we did not recognize any goodwill impairment.
For our 2020 goodwill assessment, we performed a quantitative analysis for the five reporting units that existed at the time of the assessment using a combination of income and market approaches with the assistance of a third-party valuation appraiser. As of August 31, 2020, we completed our annual impairment test for goodwill with all of our reporting units having fair values in excess of their carrying values, resulting in no impairment of goodwill. Our number of reporting units decreased from five in 2020 to three in 2021 as a result of the spin-off and other organizational changes.
The income approach of determining fair value is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. The discount rates reflect management’s judgment and are based on a risk adjusted weighted-average cost of capital utilizing industry market data of businesses similar to the reporting units. Inherent in our preparation of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business plans, expected growth rates, cost of capital and tax rates. Our forecasts also reflect expectations concerning future economic conditions, interest rates and other market data. The market approach of determining fair value is based on comparable market multiples for companies engaged in similar businesses, as well as recent transactions within our industry. We believe this approach, which utilizes multiple valuation techniques, yields the most appropriate evidence of fair value.
Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management, and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods. Changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit, and therefore could affect the likelihood and amount of potential impairment.
Self-Insurance Accruals
We use a combination of self-insurance programs and purchased insurance to provide for the costs of medical, casualty, liability, vehicular, cargo, workers’ compensation, cyber risk and property claims. We periodically evaluate our level of insurance coverage and adjust our insurance levels based on risk tolerance and premium expense. Liabilities for the risks we retain, including estimates of claims incurred but not reported, are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical cost experience, demographic and severity factors, and judgments about current and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels. Additionally, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. We believe the actuarial methods are appropriate for measuring these self-insurance accruals. However, based on the number of claims and the length of time from incurrence of the claims to ultimate settlement, the use of any estimation method is sensitive to the assumptions and factors described above. Accordingly, changes in these assumptions and factors can affect the estimated liability and those amounts may be different than the actual costs paid to settle the claims.
Income Taxes
Our annual effective tax rate is based on our income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Judgment and estimates are required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. Evaluating our tax positions would include but not be limited to our tax positions on internal restructuring transactions as well as the spin-off of GXO. We review our tax positions quarterly and as new information becomes available. Our effective tax rate in any financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and/or level of earnings by taxing jurisdiction.
Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing all available evidence, including the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, carrybacks available, and historical and projected pre-tax profits generated by our operations. Valuation allowances are established when, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management weighs the available positive and negative evidence, including limitations on the use of tax losses and other carryforwards due to changes in ownership, historic information, and projections of future sources of taxable income that include and exclude future reversals of taxable temporary differences.
