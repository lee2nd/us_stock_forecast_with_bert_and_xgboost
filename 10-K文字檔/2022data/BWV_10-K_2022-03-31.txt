Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Some of the numbers included herein have been rounded for the convenience of presentation. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Part I. “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
We are a biotechnology company focused on the research and development of transformational vaccines to prevent infectious diseases worldwide. Our versatile vaccine platform has unique molecular properties that enables delivery of various antigens, which can be utilized to develop singular or multi-targeted vaccines. Our lead influenza (flu) vaccine program uses proprietary technology to identify specific epitopes, or proteins of antigens, with cross-reactive properties, that enable the potential development of a universal flu vaccine. We are focused on developing novel vaccines that induce durable and long-term immunity. We believe that our pipeline and vaccine platform are synergistic for developing next generation preventive vaccines to improve both health outcomes and quality of life globally.
Since our inception in October 2018, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to performing research and development, undertaking preclinical studies and enabling manufacturing activities in support of our product development efforts, hiring personnel, acquiring and developing our technology and vaccine candidates, organizing and staffing our company, performing business planning, establishing our intellectual property portfolio and raising capital to support and expand such activities. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. To date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from our sale of preferred securities to seed investors and the close of our initial public offering. We will continue to require additional capital to develop our vaccine candidates and fund operations beyond the second quarter of 2023. Accordingly, until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our vaccine candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through public or private equity or debt financings, third-party (including government) funding and marketing and distribution arrangements, as well as other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or any combination of these approaches.
We have incurred net losses since inception and expect to continue to incur net losses in the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending in large part on the timing of our preclinical studies, clinical trials and manufacturing activities, and our expenditures on other research and development activities. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had working capital of approximately $1.4 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately $6.0 million. We will need to raise additional capital to fund our planned operations beyond the second quarter of 2023.
While we believe that we can raise additional capital to fund our planned operations, until we generate revenue sufficient to support self-sustaining cash flows, if ever, we will need to raise additional capital to fund our continued operations to execute our long-term business plan, including our product development and commercialization activities related to our current and future products. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, or that we will ever generate revenue sufficient to provide for self-sustaining cash flows.
We do not expect to generate any revenue from commercial product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our vaccine candidates, which we expect will take a number of years. We expect our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:
● advance vaccine candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials;
● require the manufacture of supplies for our preclinical studies and clinical trials;
● pursue regulatory approval of vaccine candidates;
● hire additional personnel;
● operate as a public company;
● acquire, discover, validate and develop additional vaccine candidates; and
● obtain, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio.
We rely and will continue to rely on third parties in the conduct of our preclinical studies and clinical trials and for manufacturing and supply of our vaccine candidates. We have no internal manufacturing capabilities, and we will continue to rely on third parties, of which the main suppliers are single-source suppliers, for our preclinical and clinical trial materials. Given our stage of development, we do not yet have a marketing or sales organization or commercial infrastructure. Accordingly, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our vaccine candidates, we also expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with vaccine development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate revenue from the sale of our vaccines, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and may be forced to reduce our operations.

COVID-19 Impacts
We are continuing to closely monitor the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on our business and are taking proactive efforts designed to protect the health and safety of our employees and to maintain business continuity. We believe that the measures we are implementing are appropriate, and we will continue to monitor and seek to comply with guidance from governmental authorities and adjust our activities as appropriate. Based on guidance issued by federal, state and local authorities, we transitioned to a remote work model for a vast majority of our employees in March 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an impact to our development timelines, as the pandemic continues, we could continue to see an impact on our ability to advance our programs, obtain supplies from our contract manufacturer or interact with regulators, ethics committees or other important agencies due to limitations in regulatory authority, employee resources or otherwise. In any event, if the COVID-19 pandemic continues and persists for an extended period of time, we could experience significant disruptions to our development timelines, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
In addition, while the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, the COVID-19 pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic could result in significant and prolonged disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the potential value of our common stock.
The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our development and regulatory efforts, our ability to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, if at all, and the future value of and market for our common stock will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time, such as the ultimate duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing and business closure requirements in the U.S. and in other countries, and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain and treat COVID-19. For additional information about risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic that may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, see the section titled “Risk Factors.”
Components of Results of Operations
Research and Development Expenses
Substantially all of our research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with the development of our product candidates. These expenses include fees paid to third parties to conduct certain research and development activities on our behalf, consulting costs, costs for laboratory supplies, product acquisition and license costs, certain payroll and personnel-related expenses, including salaries and bonuses, employee benefit costs and stock-based compensation expenses for our research and product development employees and allocated overheads, including information technology costs and utilities. We expense both internal and external research and development expenses as they are incurred.
We do not allocate our costs by product candidate, as a significant amount of research and development expenses include internal costs, such as payroll and other personnel expenses, laboratory supplies and allocated overhead, and external costs, such as fees paid to third parties to conduct research and development activities on our behalf, are not tracked by product candidate.
We expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially for at least the next few years, as we seek to initiate additional clinical trials for our product candidates, complete our clinical programs, pursue regulatory approval of our product candidates and prepare for the possible commercialization of such product candidates. Predicting the timing or cost to complete our clinical programs or validation of our commercial manufacturing and supply processes is difficult and delays may occur because of many factors, including factors outside of our control. For example, if the FDA or other regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. Furthermore, we are unable to predict when or if our product candidates will receive regulatory approval with any certainty.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist principally of payroll and personnel expenses, including salaries and bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expenses, professional fees for legal, consulting, accounting and tax services, including information technology costs, and other general operating expenses not otherwise classified as research and development expenses.
We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase as a result of increased personnel costs, expanded infrastructure and higher consulting, legal and accounting services costs associated with complying with the applicable stock exchange and the SEC requirements, investor relations costs and director and officer insurance premiums associated with being a public company.
Other Income
Other income consists primarily of interest income.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and
The following table summarizes our statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the periods indicated:
General and Administrative Expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2021, general and administrative expenses increased by $1.0 million compared to 2020. The increase was mainly due to an increase in discretionary bonus compensation of approximately $0.5 million, an increase in audit and accounting services of $0.3 million, and increases in other business activities and expenses such as public relations, travel expenses, and franchise tax fees, which each increased $0.1 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in wages and stock-based compensation of approximately $0.1 million.
Research and Development Expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2021, research and development expenses increased by approximately $0.8 million compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in licensing fees and patent reimbursements of approximately $0.3 million related mainly to BWV-301 and BWV-302, an increase in preclinical development activities of approximately $0.4 million mainly related to BWV-201, and an increase in research and development personnel costs of approximately $0.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation of approximately $0.2 million.
Other Income
For the year ended December 31, 2021, other income decreased by $23,000 compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to decrease in interest income after transitioning our bank account from a money market account to a business checking account.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development, undertaking preclinical studies and enabling manufacturing activities in support of our product development efforts, hiring personnel, acquiring and developing our technology and vaccine candidates, organizing and staffing our company, performing business planning, establishing our intellectual property portfolio and raising capital to support and expand such activities. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have incurred net losses in each year since inception and expect to continue to incur net losses in the foreseeable future. Our net loss was $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $6.0 million. We also generated negative operating cash flows of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
On February 23, 2022, we completed our IPO in which we received approximately $17.2 million in net proceeds, after deducting the underwriting discount, and estimated offering expenses.
We believe the existing cash at December 31, 2021, together with the net proceeds received upon the close of our initial public offering, will be sufficient to continue operations, satisfy our obligations and fund the future expenditures that will be required to conduct the clinical and regulatory work to develop our product candidates into the second quarter of 2023.
However, we will require significant amounts of additional capital to continue to fund our operations in the long term and complete our research and development activities. We will continue seeking additional financing sources to meet our working capital requirements, make continued investment in research and development and make capital expenditures needed for us to maintain and expand our business. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, or if we expend capital on projects that are not successful, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, or we may even have to cease our operations. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock.
Future Funding Requirements
Our primary uses of cash are to fund our operations, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures related to our programs and general and administrative expenditures. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue to advance our vaccine candidates, expand our corporate infrastructure, including the costs associated with being a public company and further our research and development initiatives for our vaccine candidates. We are subject to all of the risks typically related to the development of new drug candidates, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. We anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations in order to execute our long term business plan.
We estimate that, based on our existing cash as of December 31, 2021, together with the net proceeds received from the initial public offering, we have cash on hand sufficient to fund our operations into the second quarter of 2023. We will need to raise additional capital prior to commencing additional pivotal trials for certain of our vaccine candidates. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from the commercialization of our vaccine candidates or from collaboration agreements with third parties, if ever, we expect to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity or debt financings, third-party (including government) funding and marketing and distribution arrangements, as well as other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or any combination of these approaches. The future sale of equity or convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders and, in the case of preferred equity securities or convertible debt, those securities could provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock. Debt financings may subject us to covenant limitations or restrictions on our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by deteriorating global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in acquiring additional funding at levels sufficient to fund our operations or on terms favorable or acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing when needed or on terms favorable or acceptable to us, we may be forced to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs.
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
● the timing, scope, progress, results and costs of research and development, testing, screening, manufacturing, preclinical and non-clinical studies and clinical trials, including any impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic;
● the outcome, timing and cost of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for such authorities to require that we perform field efficacy studies for our vaccine candidates, require more studies than those that we currently expect or change their requirements regarding the data required to support a marketing application;
● the cost of building a sales force in anticipation of any product commercialization;
● the costs of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales, royalties and distribution, for any of our vaccine candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
● our ability to maintain existing, and establish new, strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of any such agreements, including the timing and amount of any future milestone, royalty or other payments due under any such agreement;
● any product liability or other lawsuits related to our products;
● the expenses needed to attract, hire and retain skilled personnel;
● the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales, or sales to foreign governments, of our vaccine candidates for which we may receive marketing approval;
● the costs to establish, maintain, expand, enforce and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with licensing, preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing our patents or other intellectual property rights;
● expenses needed to attract, hire and retain skilled personnel;
● the costs of operating as a public company; and
● the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may exacerbate the magnitude of the factors discussed above.
A change in the outcome of any of these or other variables could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of our vaccine candidates. Furthermore, our operating plans may change in the future, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such change.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $2.0 million, which primarily resulted from a net loss of $3.4 million, and was partially offset by a net change in our operating assets and liabilities of $1.2 million and stock-based compensation of $0.1 million.
Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1.7 million, which primarily resulted from a net loss of $1.6 million and a net change in our operating assets and liabilities of $0.5 million, partially offset by stock-based compensation of $0.3 million.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $2,000 and $12,000, respectively, which resulted from purchases of property and equipment.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, was $0.3 million related to payments of deferred offering costs and $0, respectively.
Legal Contingencies
From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising from the ordinary course of business. We record a liability for such matters when it is probable that future losses will be incurred and that such losses can be reasonably estimated.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
During the periods presented we did not have, nor do we currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
See Note 3 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for more information.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued research and development expenses fair value of common stock and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 3 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Report, we believe the following accounting policies and estimates to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Accrued Research and Development Expenses
We have entered into various agreements with contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and may enter into contracts with clinical research organizations, or CROs, in the future. As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel and third parties to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. We make estimates of our accrued research and development expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments, if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our vendors in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.
We accrue for costs related to research and development activities based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors, including CMOs, that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. Advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received. We make significant judgments and estimates in determining accrued research and development liabilities as of each reporting period based on the estimated time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly.
Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company expensed stock-based compensation to employees and non-employees over the requisite service period based on the estimated grant-date fair value of the awards. Stock-based awards to employees with graded-vesting schedules are recognized, using the accelerated attribution method, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award.
The Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent management’s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment.
Expected Term - The expected term of options represents the period that the Company’s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding based on the simplified method, which is the half-life from vesting to the end of its contractual term.
Expected Volatility - The Company computes stock price volatility over expected terms based on comparable companies historical common stock trading prices.
Common Stock Fair Value - The fair value of the common stock underlying the Company’s stock options was estimated at each grant date and was determined with the assistance of an independent third-party valuation expert. The assumptions underlying these valuations represented management’s best estimates, which involved inherent uncertainties and the application of significant levels of management judgment.
Risk-Free Interest Rate - The Company bases the risk-free interest rate on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury securities with a remaining term commensurate with the estimated expected term.
Expected Dividend - The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common shares and does not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and, therefore, uses an expected dividend yield of zero in its valuation models.
The Company recognizes forfeitures of equity awards as they occur.
Fair value of common stock
In order to determine the fair value of shares of common stock of the Company when issuing stock options and computing their estimated stock-based compensation expense, its board of directors considered with input from third party valuations, among other things, contemporaneous valuations of the Company’s common stock. Given the absence of a public trading market of the Company’s capital stock to date, its board of directors has exercised reasonable judgment and considered a number of objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common and preferred stock, including:
● the prices, rights, preferences and privileges of our preferred stock relative to our common stock;
● our business, financial condition and results of operations, including related industry trends affecting our operations;
● the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering, or IPO, or sale of our company, given prevailing market conditions;
● the lack of marketability of our common stock;
● the market performance of comparable publicly traded companies;
● U.S. and global economic and capital market conditions and outlook; and
● Common stock valuation methodology.
In estimating the fair market value of common stock of the Company, its board of directors first determined the equity value of its business using accepted valuation methods.
The Company engaged a third party valuation specialist to conduct a valuation, which used its recent preferred stock financing as a starting point and determined the equity value of the company based on the Backsolve method using an Option Pricing Method (OPM) to calculate the implied value based on a market approach. The Company’s equity value was allocated using OPM to estimate the fair market value of the Company’s classes of equity.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item.
JOBS Act
Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period.
For as long as we remain an “emerging growth company” under the recently enacted JOBS Act, we will, among other things:
● be exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;
● be permitted to omit the detailed compensation discussion and analysis from proxy statements and reports filed under the Exchange Act and instead provide a reduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation; and
● be exempt from any rules that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report on the financial statements.
Although we are still evaluating the JOBS Act, we currently intend to take advantage of some or all of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that will be available to us so long as we qualify as an “emerging growth company,” including the extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards available under Section 102(b) of the JOBS Act. Among other things, this means that our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected. Likewise, so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we may elect not to provide you with certain information, including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of our executive officers, that we would otherwise have been required to provide in filings we make with the SEC, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate our company. As a result, investor confidence in our company and the market price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.
