Overview
We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware and formed for the purpose of effecting an initial Business Combination with one or more target businesses. We intend to effectuate our initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and the private placement of the Private Placement Warrants, our stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.
The issuance of additional shares of our stock in a Business Combination:
•
may subordinate the rights of holders of our common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our common stock;
•
may subordinate the rights of holders of our common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our common stock;
•
could cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock is issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present management team;
•
may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us; and
•
may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock and/or warrants.
Similarly, if we issue debt securities, it could result in:
•
default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial Business Combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;
•
acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;
•
our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand;
•
our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants;
•
restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding;
•
our inability to pay dividends on our common stock;
•
using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our common stock if declared, our ability to pay expenses, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, and fund other general corporate purposes;
•
limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;
•
increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;
•
limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, and execution of our strategy; and
•
other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.
On January 14, 2021, we completed our IPO of 24,000,000 Units. Each Unit consists of one share of Common Stock, and one-half of one redeemable warrant, each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, pursuant to the Company’s registration statements on Form S-1 (File Nos. 333-251641 and 333-252021). The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $240,000,000.
On January 14, 2021, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we completed a private placement of an aggregate of 6,550,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds of $6,550,000.
On January 15, 2021, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full, and on January 19, 2021, the underwriters purchased an additional 3,600,000 Units at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $36,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the sale of additional Units, the Company sold an additional 720,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds of $720,000. As of January 19, 2021, an aggregate amount of $276,000,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO (including the additional 3,600,000 Units and additional 720,000 Private Placement Warrants) were deposited in the Company’s trust account established in connection with the IPO.
We paid a total of $5,520,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions and $651,036 for other costs and expenses related to the IPO.
Results of Operations
Our entire activity since inception up to December 31, 2021 relates to our formation, the Initial Public Offering and, since the closing of the Initial Public Offering, a search for a Business Combination candidate. We will not be generating any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our initial Business Combination, at the earliest.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had net loss of $2,632,760 which consisted of $3,704,239 in formation and operating costs, offset by $115,444 in interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account and $956,035 in change in fair value of warrants.
For the Period from October 15, 2020 (Inception) to December 31, 2020, we had a net loss of $526 which consisted solely of formation and operating costs.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had $462,274 in our operating bank account, and a working capital deficit of $2,710,629, excluding the franchise tax payable that can be paid through the interest income earned on Trust Account.
Prior to the completion of the Initial Public Offering, our liquidity needs had been satisfied through a capital contribution from the Sponsor of $25,000 in exchange for Founder Shares, to cover certain offering costs, and a loan under an unsecured promissory note from the Sponsor of $150,000. Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial
Public Offering and Private Placement, our liquidity needs have been satisfied through the proceeds from the consummation of the Private Placement not held in the Trust Account.
In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, our Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide us Working Capital Loans.
On August 6, 2021, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor in connection with a Working Capital Loan made by the Sponsor to the Company pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to $300,000 in the aggregate. The note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier to occur of (i) January 14, 2023 or (ii) the effective date of a Business Combination. Any amounts outstanding under the note are convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the Sponsor, the terms of which shall be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. As of December 31, 2021, the Company borrowed $150,000 under the note.
Going Concern Consideration
The Company anticipates that the $462,274 in its operating bank account as of December 31, 2021 will not be sufficient to allow the Company to operate for at least the next 12 months, assuming that a business combination is not consummated during that time. The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern one year from the issuance date of the financial statements. Management plans to address this uncertainty through loans from its Sponsor, officers, directors, or third parties. None of the Sponsor, officers or directors are under any obligation to advance funds to, or to invest in, the Company. There is no assurance that the Company’s plans to raise capital or to consummate a business combination will be successful. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements
As of December 31, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. We have no obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or entered into any non-financial assets.
On November 29, 2021, we entered into the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into GRIID, the separate limited liability company existence of Merger Sub will cease and GRIID, as the surviving company of the Merger, will continue its existence under the Limited Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of ADEX.
The Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby were unanimously approved by the board of directors of ADEX and the board of managers of GRIID.
Contractual Obligations
At December 31, 2021, we did not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities.
JOBS Act
On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We will qualify as an “emerging growth company” and under the JOBS Act will be allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our
financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.
Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an “emerging growth company”, we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO’s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of the IPO or until we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” whichever is earlier.
Critical Accounting Policies
Management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our financial information. We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 2-Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain of our accounting policies require that management apply significant judgments in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates. On an ongoing basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and, therefore, actual results could differ from our estimates.
We have identified the following as our critical accounting policies:
Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption
All of the 27,600,000 common shares sold as part of the Units contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company’s liquidation, if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company’s amended and restated articles of incorporation. In accordance with ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require common shares subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Therefore, all 27,600,000 common shares were classified outside of permanent equity as of December 31, 2021.
The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur upon the IPO and will adjust the carrying value of redeemable ordinary shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable common shares are recorded as charges against additional paid in capital and accumulated deficit.
Net Loss Per Share of Common Stock
The Company has two categories of shares, which are referred to as redeemable common shares and non-redeemable common shares. Earnings and losses are shared pro rata between the two categories of shares for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Net loss per share for the period from October 15, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020 was computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, excluding shares of common stock subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor. Weighted average shares were reduced for the effect of an aggregate of 900,000 shares of common stock that were subject to forfeiture if the over-allotment option was not exercised by the underwriters. At December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any dilutive securities and other
contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into shares of common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share for the period presented.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments, including issued stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to ASC 480 and ASC 815-40, “Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Stock (“ASC 815-40”).” The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period.
At December 31, 2021, the Company has evaluated both the public and private warrants under ASC 480 and ASC 815-40. Such guidance provides that because the Private Placement Warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each Private Placement Warrant must be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, the Company classified each warrant as a liability at its fair value. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liability will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the Company’s statement of operations. The Private Placement Warrants had met the requirement for equity accounting treatment when initially issued. On December 23, 2021, the Private Placement Warrants were modified such that the Private Placement Warrants no longer meet the criteria for equity treatment. As such, the Private Placement Warrants were treated as derivative liability instruments from the date of the modification.
