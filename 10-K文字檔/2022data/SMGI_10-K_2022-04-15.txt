Overview
We are a growth-oriented transportation services company focused on the domestic logistics market. Our primary business objective is to grow our operations and create value for our stockholders through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. We have implemented a Buy and Build growth strategy of acquiring middle market transportation companies and generating organic growth post-acquisition when possible by removing business constraints and strategic cross-selling of services benefiting us with higher equipment utilization and market share. We believe our business focus and equipment fleet position us to be significant participant in the domestic United States infrastructure market.
Our wholly-owned operating subsidiaries are:
·5J Trucking LLC
·5J Oilfield Services LLC
·5J Specialized LLC
·5J Transportation LLC
·5J Logistics Services LLC
Together these business units are referred to as the “5J Transportation Group”.
Our operating subsidiaries provide a range of transportation services such as:
·Transporting infrastructure components including bridge beams and power generation transformers
·Transporting wind energy components
·Heavy haul of production equipment, heat exchangers, coolers, construction equipment, refinery components
·Super heavy haul over-dimensional permit-required loads up to 500 thousand pounds for engineered projects
●Transportation of midstream compressors
●Flatbed freight
●Crane services used to set equipment on compressor stations, pipeline infrastructure and load drilling rig components
●Drilling rig relocation for drilling contractors and oil and gas operators
·Freight brokerage
In connection with our focus to expand our transportation services business and exit certain up-stream oil and gas (O&G) industrial-related businesses, the financial results of the following business have been classified as discontinued operations on our consolidated financial statements for the following businesses:
·MG Cleaners LLC. The Company sold this business in December 2020
·Trinity Services LLC
We are headquartered in Houston, Texas with facilities in Floresville, Hempstead, Henderson, Houston, Odessa, Palestine, Victoria, Texas and Fort Mill, South Carolina. Our web site is www.5J-Group.com and www.SMGIndustries.com.
Acquisition, divestiture and wind-down of businesses
On February 27, 2020, we acquired one hundred percent of the membership interests of each of 5J Oilfield Services LLC (“5J Oilfield”) and 5J Trucking LLC (“5J Trucking”), combined referred to as “5J”. The aggregate purchase price of 5J was $12.7 million, consisting of a combination of cash, notes and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.
In December 2020 we sold MG Cleaners LLC (“MG”), an O&G drilling rig cleaning company. The results of operations of MG are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 as “net loss from discontinued operations”.
In December 2020, the Company decided to cease the operations of Trinity Services LLC (“Trinity”), an O&G drilling pad dirt construction company. The assets and operations of Trinity are reflected on the December 31, 2021 and 2020 Consolidated Balance Sheets as “assets or liabilities of discontinued operations” and the results of operations are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 as “net loss from discontinued operations”.
Management believes certain comparisons of 2021 to 2020 are not meaningful as the variances are due almost entirely to the 5J acquisition (as disclosed in Note 9). Where applicable, this analysis provides explanation of any meaningful causes of variances that are in addition to variances resulting from the 5J acquisition.
In the second quarter of 2021 we formed 5J Transportation LLC in connection with leasing the East Houston terminal operations for our flatbed services. In the first quarter of 2021, we formed 5J Brokerage LLC, which was renamed 5J Logistics Services LLC during the fourth quarter of 2021, our transportation brokerage business, in connection with offering those services.
All of our 5J subsidiaries are referred to as the 5J Transportation Group.
Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020
The Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 present the assets and liabilities of MG and Trinity as discontinued operations. The Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years end December 31, 2021 and 2020 present the results of MG and Trinity as Net loss from discontinued operations. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years end December 31, 2021 and 2020 present operating, investing and financing activities of MG and Trinity as cash flows from or used in discontinued operations.
Sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased to $52,113,827, an increase of 95.4% from $26,665,719 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in sales in the year end 2021 was primarily driven by increased revenues in our industrial transportation segment from higher customer activity transporting drilling rigs, and in our heavy haul business transporting bridge beams, over-dimensional infrastructure items and large natural gas compressors. Our increase in revenues was also attributable to the new contribution of revenues from our 5J Transportation flat bed and 5J Logistics brokerage division, not present in the previous year period along with the general improvement in the domestic United States economy from COVID-19 pandemic. This was partially offset by the absence of revenues during the periods from the discontinued operations that were present in the prior period.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, cost of sales increased to $52,714,418, or approximately 101.2% of sales, compared to $29,477,208, or about 110.5% of sales for the 2020 period. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues is the result of higher revenues covering more fixed costs in cost of sales compared to the previous year. The increase in cost of sales as a total amount is due primarily to higher direct labor costs, higher freight expense, higher fuel
costs, and higher depreciation expenses, a non-cash expense, allocated in cost of sales compared to the previous year period 2020. Our Cost of Sales includes non-cash depreciation expense of $5,398,529 for the year ended December 31, 2021, and $4,901,689 for the comparable period in 2020.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased to $8,375,682, or approximately 16.1% of revenues, compared to $5,267,186, or 19.8% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in total amount was due primarily to higher wage expense, professional fees and higher consulting costs from accounting and other consultants. The non-cash share based compensation expense included in SG&A expenses was $67,460 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $66,566 for the same period in 2020. Bad debt expense included in SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $454,990, as compared to bad debt expense of $474,708 in 2020 resulting from uncollectable accounts receivables from certain customers.
Impairment expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $0 and $1,084,671 in the prior year. The expenses in 2020 related primarily to the full impairment of the net book value for the oil tools and the frac water equipment from our discontinued operations at Momentum and Trinity.
Acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $2,000, compared to acquisition costs of $1,485,829 for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the acquisition of 5J in February 2020.
Interest expense, net, increased to $7,618,889 during the year ended December 31, 2021 from $3,801,020 during the year ended December 31, 2020, resulting from increased convertible note issuances and associated debt discount amortization. Gain on the US SBA’s PPP loan forgiveness program for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $5,023,089 and $94,339, respectively.
Gain on sale of assets for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $43,624 and $220,315 and was primarily related to the disposal of 5J assets.
The net loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $11,484,636 as compared to a net loss of $14,105,158 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our decrease in net loss in 2021 was primarily attributable to lower SG&A expenses, no impairment expense and the gain on PPP loan forgiveness described above.
We plan to address our net loss and future operating results with a goal to achieve positive cash flow from operations by increasing sales organically or through acquisitions, covering more fixed costs within cost of sales, improving gross margins with raising prices for our services as the market bears, a better sales mix adding more higher margin service revenues such as super heavy haul, and reducing general and administrative costs including professional fees.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $8,445,260 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $11,759,723 for the year ended December 31, 2020, including $226,932 of cash used in and $484,235 of cash provided, respectively, related to discontinued operations.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities consisted of net proceeds from secured line of credit of $5,326,060, net proceeds from notes payable of $15,064,003 and proceeds from convertible notes payable of $3,906,079, partially offset by payments on notes payable of $15,553,327, payment on convertible notes payable of $50,000 and payment of deferred finance costs of $20,623.

Our cash flows from operations are primarily funded through our financing activities, including our accounts receivable line of credit facility, notes and loans, stock sales, issuing our stock for services and various leases. Currently, we believe we will need to continue to utilize lines of credit, borrowings and stock sales to sufficiently sustain our current level of operations for the next 12 months. At present, we believe the industry and general domestic economic activity is still partially depressed given the current perceived in progress economic recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic and recent rebound and growth in current commodity prices. We likely will require additional capital to maintain or expand operations. Additionally, we believe any material acquisition of another operating company would require additional outside capital consisting of debt or equity. Failure to secure additional funds could significantly hamper our ongoing operations particularly if a down cycle in our industry continues further. As the business cycle improves, and the pandemic dissipates in the markets we serve, we plan to improve our cash flows provided in operating activities by focusing on increasing sales by increasing utilization of the assets we have acquired and offering higher value services that receive higher gross margins. However, there can be no assurances given of industry improvement, pandemic relief or improved cash flows of our business.
Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures internally through cash flow, leasing and financing arrangements. We intend to continue to fund future capital expenditures through cash flow, as well as through capital available to us pursuant to our line of credit, capital from the sale of our debt and equity securities and through commercial leasing and financing programs.
On June 19, 2019, each of MG Cleaners LLC (“MG”), Trinity Services LLC (“Trinity”) and Jake Oilfield Solutions LLC (“Jake”), each of which were wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into separate revolving accounts receivable financing facilities (collectively the “Catalyst AR Facility”) with Catalyst Finance L.P.
