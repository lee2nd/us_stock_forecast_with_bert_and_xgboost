ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. References herein to “Notes” refer to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements. Each of the periods presented had fifty-two weeks.
Executive Overview
Chico’s FAS is a Florida-based fashion company founded in 1983 on Sanibel Island, Florida. The Company reinvented the fashion retail experience by creating fashion communities anchored by service, which put the customer at the center of everything we do. As one of the leading fashion retailers in North America, Chico’s FAS is a company of three unique brands operating under the Chico's, White House Black Market (“WHBM”) and Soma brand names - each thriving in their own white space, founded by women, led by women, providing solutions that millions of women say give them confidence and joy. We sometimes refer to our Chico's and WHBM brands collectively as our “Apparel Group.” Our distinct lifestyle brands typically serve the needs of fashion-savvy women with household incomes in the moderate to high income level. We earn revenue and generate cash through the sale of merchandise in our domestic retail stores, our various Company-operated e-commerce websites, our call center (which takes orders for all of our brands), through unaffiliated franchise partners and through third-party channels. As of January 29, 2022, we operated 1,266 stores across 46 states, Puerto Rico and the United States (“U.S.”) Virgin Islands, and sold merchandise through 59 international franchise locations in Mexico and 2 domestic airport locations.
We utilize an integrated, omnichannel approach to managing our business. We want our customers to experience our brands holistically and to view the various retail channels we operate as a single, integrated experience rather than as separate sales channels operating independently. This approach allows our customers to browse, purchase, return or exchange our merchandise through whatever sales channel and at whatever time is most convenient. As a result, we track total sales and comparable sales on a combined basis.
Fiscal 2021 Business Highlights
The Company’s fiscal 2021 business highlights include:
•Generated robust results: Chico's FAS posted $0.37 net income per diluted share for fiscal 2021, the best performance since 2017, driven by sales growth, gross margin expansion and diligent expense control.
•Continued improving sales performance at Chico's: Sales at Chico’s continued to grow during the year, as demonstrated by the 33.2% increase in comparable sales for the thirteen weeks ended January 29, 2022 (the “fourth quarter”). Chico's continued to benefit from elevated product styling and quality enhancements, and customers responded enthusiastically to denim, wovens and sweaters. Inventories remained lean, which fueled high productivity and increased full-price sales in the quarter.
•Continued improving sales performance at WHBM: WHBM continued to deliver exceptional sales gains in fiscal 2021, posting a 45.6% comparable sales increase in the fourth quarter. WHBM continued to benefit from elevated quality and product enhancements, and customers responded positively to denim and new jacket silhouettes. Inventories remained lean, which fueled high productivity and increased full-price sales in the quarter.
•Continued exceptional sales growth at Soma: Soma posted a 9.5% comparable sales increase over the thirteen weeks ended January 30, 2021 and a 26.2% comparable sales increase over the thirteen weeks ended February 1, 2020. Data from market research firm NPD Group Inc. shows that Soma’s growth continues to outpace the market in non-sport bras, panties and sleepwear. Management believes this research, along with continued strong performance, is a clear indication that Soma is well positioned to capture additional market share and grow into a billion-dollar brand.
•Enhanced marketing continued to drive traffic as well as new customers: Chico's FAS continued to elevate its marketing, allocating more resources to digital storytelling, influencers and other social efforts. These initiatives are driving more customers to our brands, with total customer count up 17% over fiscal 2020 and the average customer age continuing to trend younger.
•Improved gross margin: The full year gross margin rate rose to 36.7%, the Company’s best performance since fiscal 2017, driven by higher full-price sales, less promotional activity and improved leverage of occupancy costs on higher sales, partially offset by increases in raw materials and freight costs.
•Continued cost discipline: Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") declined to 33.0% of net sales for fiscal 2021, the Company’s best performance since fiscal 2017, reflecting the impact of sales leverage and the ongoing benefit of cost savings initiatives implemented in prior years.
•Obtained additional rent reductions: In fiscal 2021, Chico's FAS obtained approximately $22 million in incremental savings from landlords in addition to the $65 million of reductions and abatements negotiated during fiscal 2020, for a total savings of $87 million. We believe these renegotiated store leases will provide an occupancy tailwind that will further enhance store profitability.
•Strengthened balance sheet: The Company ended fiscal 2021 with more than $115 million in cash, even after repaying $50 million of long-term debt during the year.
Financial Results
Income per diluted share for fiscal 2021 was $0.37 compared to loss per diluted share of $3.11 in fiscal 2020 and loss per diluted share of $0.11 in fiscal 2019. Results for fiscal 2021 include the unfavorable impact of litigation settlement charges of approximately $4 million, after-tax. Results for fiscal 2020 include approximately $200 million in significant after-tax non-cash charges as a result of the novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic (the “COVID-19 pandemic” or the “pandemic”). Results for fiscal 2019 include the unfavorable impact of accelerated depreciation charges of approximately $8 million, after-tax, related to our retail fleet optimization plan and severance and other related net charges (collectively, “Severance Charges”) of approximately $2 million, after-tax, in connection with actions taken to reposition our then organizational structure.

Current Trends
The pandemic has resulted in significant challenges across our business starting in March 2020 and is expected to continue to disrupt our business operations in fiscal 2022 to varying degrees. Many of our markets imposed limitations, varying by market and in frequency, on the access to the Company's store fleet, including temporary store closures and/or a reduction in hours, staffing and capacity. We continue to focus on evolving consumer demand emerging from the pandemic experience and have accelerated our transformation to a digital-first company, fast-tracking numerous innovation and technology investments across all three of our brands. Even as governmental restrictions become relaxed and markets are primarily open, we expect continued uncertainty and volatility on our business operations, operating results and operating cash flows as the ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with the pandemic continue to affect consumer behavior, spending levels and shopping preferences.
The Company remains confident that it currently has sufficient liquidity to repay its obligations as they become due for the foreseeable future as the Company continues to drive operational efficiency and effectiveness, including executing on its
cost saving initiatives announced in fiscal 2020 to mitigate the macro challenges of the pandemic. However, the extent to which the pandemic impacts our business operations, financial results, and liquidity will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; our response to and ability to mitigate the impact of the pandemic; the negative impact the pandemic has on global and regional economies and economic activity, including the duration and magnitude of its impact on unemployment rates and consumer discretionary spending; its short- and longer-term impact on the levels of consumer confidence; the ability of our suppliers, vendors and customers to successfully address the impacts of the pandemic; supply chain disruptions; actions governments, businesses and individuals take in response to the pandemic; and how quickly economies recover after the pandemic subsides.
Fiscal 2022 Outlook
For the fiscal 2022 first quarter the Company currently expects:
•Consolidated net sales of $485 million to $500 million;
•Gross margin rate as a percent of net sales of 36.9% to 37.7%;
•SG&A as a percent of net sales of 33.9% to 34.3%;
•Effective income tax rate of 20%; and
•Earnings per diluted share of $0.07 to $0.11.
For the fiscal 2022 full year the Company currently expects:
•Consolidated net sales of $2,085 million to $2,115 million;
•Gross margin rate as a percent of net sales of 36.7% to 37.2%;
•SG&A as a percent of net sales of 32.8% to 33.2%;
•Effective income tax rate of 26%;
•Earnings per diluted share of $0.40 to $0.50; and
•Capital and cloud-based expenditures of approximately $65 million to $70 million, primarily driven by investments in Soma, targeted reinvestments in stores and technology enhancements.
Key Performance Indicators
In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of key performance and financial measures to evaluate our business, develop financial forecasts and make strategic decisions. These key measures include comparable sales, gross margin as a percent of sales, diluted income (loss) per share and return on net assets (“RONA”). In light of the pandemic, we have shifted our focus to effectively manage our liquidity position, including aligning our operating cost structure with expected sales. We will continue to evaluate our other key performance and financial measures in addition to our liquidity position. The following describes these measures.
Liquidity
Liquidity is measured through cash flow, which is the measure of cash provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities. We believe that as a result of the Company’s extensive measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic discussed above, we were able to, and continue to, effectively manage our liquidity position.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales is an omnichannel measure of the amount of sales generated from products the Company sells directly to the consumer relative to the amount of sales generated in the comparable prior-year period. Comparable sales is defined as sales from stores open for the preceding twelve months, including stores that have been expanded, remodeled or relocated within the same general market and includes online, catalog and international sales. The comparable sales calculation excludes the negative impact of stores closed four or more days. The Company has historically viewed comparable sales as a key performance indicator to measure the performance of our business, however, we are not providing full year comparable sales figures for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 as we believe it is not a meaningful measure due to varying degrees of business disruptions and periods of store closures and/or stores operating at reduced hours as a result of the pandemic during fiscal 2020.
Gross Margin as a Percentage of Net Sales
Gross margin as a percentage of net sales is computed as gross margin divided by net sales. We believe gross margin as a percentage of net sales is a primary metric to measure the performance of our business as it is used to determine the value of incremental sales, and to guide pricing and promotion decisions.
Diluted Income (Loss) per Share
Income (loss) per share is determined using the two-class method when it is more dilutive than the treasury stock method. Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, including participating securities. Diluted income (loss) per share reflects the dilutive effect of potential common shares from non-participating securities such as stock options, performance stock units and restricted stock units. Whereas basic income (loss) per share serves as an indicator of the Company's profitability, we believe diluted income (loss) per share is a primary metric provided it gauges the Company's quality of income (loss) per share assuming all potential common shares from non-participating securities are exercised.
Return on Net Assets
RONA is defined as (a) net income (loss) divided by (b) the “five-point average” (based on balances at the beginning of the first quarter plus the final balances for each quarter of the fiscal year) of net working capital less cash and marketable securities plus fixed assets. We believe RONA is a primary metric as it helps to determine how well the Company is utilizing its assets. As such, a higher RONA could indicate that the Company is using its assets and working capital efficiently and effectively.
Exit of Canada Frontline Operations
On July 30, 2020, Chico’s FAS Canada, Co., an immaterial subsidiary of the Company, filed for bankruptcy with the Ontario, Canada office of the Superintendent in Bankruptcy. This action resulted in the permanent closure of four Chico’s and six WHBM boutiques in Ontario, Canada. The permanent closure of the Canadian boutiques, which constitute all of the Company’s Canadian boutiques, was part of the Company’s ongoing cost-savings measures taken to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and address the operational and financial challenges associated with operating in Canada. In connection with this effort, in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we exited our Canada frontline operations and recorded on a net basis a non-material charge, including the realization of a cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net Income (Loss) and Net Income (Loss) Per Diluted Share
For fiscal 2021, the Company reported net income of $46 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to a net loss for fiscal 2020 of $360 million, or $3.11 per diluted share. Results for fiscal 2021 include pre-tax litigation settlement charges of approximately $4 million and is reflected in SG&A in the accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss). Results for fiscal 2020 were significantly impacted by the pandemic and included the following non-cash charges:
(1) All significant charges relate to the impact of the pandemic. Less significant charges that may have been incurred are not reflected in the table above.
(2) May not foot due to rounding.
(3) Presented pre-tax.
(4) Primarily includes impairment on leasehold improvements at certain underperforming stores.
(5) Includes impairment on capitalized implementation costs related to our cloud computing arrangements and other technology-related assets.
Net loss for fiscal 2020 was $360 million, or $3.11 per diluted share, compared to a net loss for fiscal 2019 of $13 million, or $0.11 per diluted share. The fiscal 2020 net loss includes approximately $200 million in significant after-tax non-cash charges as a result of the pandemic. The fiscal 2019 net loss includes the unfavorable impact of accelerated depreciation charges of approximately $8 million, after-tax, related to our retail fleet optimization plan and Severance Charges of approximately $2 million, after-tax, related to our then revised organizational structure.
Net Sales
The following table depicts net sales by Chico’s, WHBM and Soma in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019:
(1) May not foot due to rounding.
Net sales for fiscal 2021 increased to $1,810 million from $1,324 million in fiscal 2020. This 36.7% increase primarily reflects fiscal 2020 disruptions related to the pandemic, including temporary store closures and limited hours, partially offset by 36 permanent store closures since fiscal 2020.
For fiscal 2020, net sales were $1,324 million compared to $2,038 million in fiscal 2019. This 35.0% decrease primarily reflects fiscal 2020 disruptions related to the pandemic, including temporary store closures or stores operating at reduced hours, reduced in-store traffic, changing consumer patterns and the impact of 39 net store closures since fiscal 2019, partially offset by strong double-digit growth in digital sales during fiscal 2020.
The Company is not providing full year comparable sales figures for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 as we believe it is not a meaningful measure due to varying degrees of business disruptions and periods of store closures and/or stores operating at reduced hours as a result of the pandemic during fiscal 2020.
Cost of Goods Sold/Gross Margin
The following table depicts cost of goods sold and gross margin in dollars and gross margin as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019:
For fiscal 2021, gross margin was $664 million, or 36.7% of net sales, compared to $184 million, or 13.9% of net sales, in fiscal 2020. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin rate primarily reflects improved leverage of occupancy costs with rising sales, the impact of inventory write-offs and store impairments as a result of the pandemic in fiscal 2020 as reflected in the Summary of Significant Non-Cash Charges table herein, and margin expansion as a result of higher full-price sales and less promotional activity, partially offset by increases in raw materials and freight costs.
For fiscal 2020, gross margin was $184 million, or 13.9% of net sales, compared to $702 million, or 34.4% of net sales, in fiscal 2019. The decrease in gross margin rate primarily reflects lower maintained margin including pre-tax inventory write-offs of $55 million, or 4.2% of net sales, the impact of temporary store closures or stores operating at reduced hours which resulted in deleverage of fixed occupancy costs, and store impairment charges of $23 million, or 1.8% of net sales.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
The following table depicts SG&A, which includes store and direct operating expenses, marketing expenses and National Store Support Center expenses, in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019:
For fiscal 2021, SG&A was $597 million, or 33.0%, compared to $527 million, or 39.8%, in fiscal 2020. The decrease in SG&A as a percent of net sales primarily reflects sales leverage and the benefit of cost savings initiatives.
For fiscal 2020, SG&A was $527 million, or 39.8%, compared to $714 million, or 35.0%, in fiscal 2019. This $187 million decrease primarily reflects the Company's fiscal 2020 expense reduction initiatives to align its cost structure with sales, partially offset by the impact of pre-tax impairments charges of $10 million related to other asset impairments as reflected in the Summary of Significant Non-Cash Charges table herein.
Retail Fleet Optimization Plan
In fiscal 2018, the Company announced a retail fleet optimization plan to rebalance the mix between our physical store presence and our digital network. In fiscal 2019, the Company recorded pre-tax accelerated depreciation charges within COGS of approximately $11 million associated with this retail fleet optimization plan. The fiscal 2019 after-tax impact of these charges was approximately $8 million. Accelerated depreciation of property and equipment for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 was immaterial.
To further support the digital strategy and improve store productivity, we anticipate closing approximately 40 stores in fiscal 2022. We also plan to invest in opening up to 30 Soma stores in fiscal 2022.
Income Taxes
The effective tax rate for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 was 23.0%, 21.7% and (6.7)%, respectively. The fiscal 2021 effective tax rate primarily reflects a rate differential due to benefits provided under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act, partially offset by a valuation allowance due to the change in deferred tax assets for fiscal 2021. The fiscal 2020 effective tax rate primarily reflects a rate differential due to benefits provided under CARES Act, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the Company’s book goodwill impairment charge and the valuation allowance against the Company’s deferred tax assets in fiscal 2020. The fiscal 2019 effective tax rate primarily reflects an income tax benefit on an annual operating loss, offset by an unfavorable fiscal 2018 provision-to-return adjustment, a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets for charitable contribution carryforwards and employee share-based compensation expense.
Cash, Marketable Securities and Debt
At the end of fiscal 2021, cash and marketable securities totaled $115 million compared to $109 million at the end of fiscal 2020. Debt at the end of fiscal 2021 totaled $99 million compared to $149 million at the end of fiscal 2020, reflecting a principal payment of $50 million on debt made in fiscal 2021.
Inventories
At the end of fiscal 2021, inventories totaled $323 million compared to $204 million at the end of fiscal 2020. This $119 million increase, or 58.5%, primarily reflects a $79 million increase in in-transit inventories due to extended in-transit times in the global supply chain and elevated on-hand inventories to align with higher consumer demand.
Income Tax Receivable
At the end of fiscal 2021, our consolidated balance sheet reflected a $11 million income tax receivable after collection of $50 million during fiscal 2021, related to the recovery of Federal income taxes paid in prior years and other tax law changes as a result of the CARES Act.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
The Company’s material cash requirements include amounts outstanding under operating leases; open purchase orders for inventory and other operating expenses, in the normal course of business; contractual commitments for future capital expenditures; long-term debt obligations; and interest payments on long-term debt. Our ongoing capital requirements will continue to be primarily for enhancing and expanding our omnichannel capabilities, including investments in our stores; information technology; and supply chain.
In response to the pandemic, the Company took actions to reinforce its financial position and liquidity. Specific actions include: significantly reducing capital and expense structures, centralizing key functions to create a nimbler organization to better align costs with expected sales; suspending the quarterly dividend commencing April 2020; aligning inventory receipts with expected demand; partnering with suppliers and vendors to reduce operating costs and extend payment terms; and reviewing real estate and actively negotiating with landlords to deliver rent relief in the form of reductions, abatements and other concessions. In October 2020, the Company also amended and extended its credit facility to strengthen its liquidity and enhance its financial stability. The Company anticipates satisfying its material cash requirements from its cash flows from operating activities, our cash and marketable securities on hand, capacity within our credit facility and other liquidity options.
The following table summarizes cash flows for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019:
(1) May not foot due to rounding.
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 was $63 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of $98 million for fiscal 2020. The change in net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects higher net income and the timing of income taxes and payables, partially offset by elevated inventories and normalized rent payments and rent settlements.
Net cash used in operating activities in fiscal 2020 was $98 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $33 million for fiscal 2019. The change in net cash used in operating activities primarily reflects the fiscal 2020 net loss, partially offset by the suspension or reduction of rent payments in fiscal 2020 and reduced operational spending as sales declined.
Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2021 was $14 million compared to $34 million for fiscal 2020, primarily reflecting a $27 million decrease in net proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, partially offset by the sale of certain Corporate assets of $8 million.
Net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2020 was $34 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $36 million for fiscal 2019, reflecting a $47 million increase in net proceeds from the sale of marketable securities and reduced capital spend.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2021 was $52 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $91 million in fiscal 2020, primarily reflecting a $50 million payment on borrowings in fiscal 2021 compared to $107 million in net proceeds from borrowings in fiscal 2020, partially offset by an $11 million dividend payment in fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2021, we received approximately $0.1 million in proceeds from issuing approximately 3 million shares related to employee stock ownership plans.
Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2020 was $91 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $58 million in fiscal 2019, primarily reflecting a $122 million increase in net proceeds from borrowings and the suspension of dividend payments commencing in April 2020. In fiscal 2020, we paid one cash dividend at $0.09 per share on our common stock, totaling $11 million, and received approximately $0.4 million in proceeds from issuing approximately 2 million shares related to employee stock ownership plans.
Store and Franchise Activity
During fiscal 2021, we had 36 permanent store closures, consisting of 19 Chico's stores, 14 WHBM stores and 3 Soma stores. As of January 29, 2022, the Company's franchise operations consisted of 59 international retail locations in Mexico and 2 domestic airport locations.
Stores continue to be an important part of our omnichannel strategy, and digital sales are higher in markets where we have a retail presence, but we intend to optimize our real estate portfolio, reflecting our emphasis on digital and our priority for higher profitability standards. We will continue to adjust our store base to align with these standards, primarily as leases come due, lease kickouts are available, or buyouts make economic sense. We closed 36 underperforming locations during fiscal 2021 and ended fiscal 2021 with 1,266 boutiques. The Company anticipates closing approximately 40 stores in fiscal 2022, which primarily includes underperforming, mall-based Chico's and WHBM boutiques. We also plan to invest in opening up to 30 Soma stores in fiscal 2022. We will continue to evaluate our store base in light of economic conditions and our business strategy and may adjust the openings and closures as conditions require or as opportunities arise.
Credit Facility
The Company and certain material domestic subsidiaries are parties to a credit agreement by and among the Company, certain material domestic subsidiaries as co-borrowers and guarantors, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo Bank”), as Agent, letter of credit issuer and swing line lender, and certain lenders party thereto, originally entered into on August 2, 2018 and amended October 30, 2020 and February 2, 2022 (the “Credit Agreement”). Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the guarantors and are secured by a first priority lien on certain assets of the Company and certain material domestic subsidiaries, including inventory, accounts receivable, cash deposits, certain insurance proceeds, real estate, fixtures and certain intellectual property. As of January 29, 2022, the Credit Agreement provided for a $285 million asset-based senior secured revolving loan (“ABL”) and letter of credit facility maturing October 30, 2025, with margin on LIBOR loans drawn under the ABL of 2.25% (subject to an increase to 2.50% based upon average quarterly excess availability under the ABL), with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%, commitment fee on the unused portion of the commitments under the ABL of 0.375%, and a minimum excess availability covenant requiring excess availability to be less than the greater of 10% of the loan cap and $29.25 million. The Credit Agreement also provides for a $15 million first-in last-out loan (“FILO”). The interest rate applicable to the FILO was equal to, at the Company's option, either a base rate, determined by reference to the federal funds rate, or LIBOR with a floor of 75 basis points, plus in each case an interest rate margin of 4.5%. The FILO includes a prepayment penalty equal to 1.0% in the first year, 0.5% in the second year and none thereafter. The FILO can only be prepaid if there are no outstanding borrowings under the ABL.
On February 2, 2022, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement (“Amendment No. 2”). Amendment No. 2, among other things, extended the maturity date from October 30, 2025 to February 2, 2027, removed and replaced the LIBOR benchmark provisions with Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) benchmark provisions, removed the anti-cash hoarding condition and amended certain covenants, including amending the minimum excess availability covenant to require excess availability of the greater of 10% of the loan cap or $20 million. Amendment No. 2 also decreased the margin on Term SOFR rate loans drawn under the ABL and FILO. Under Amendment No. 2, the interest rate applicable to Term SOFR Loans drawn under the ABL is equal to Term SOFR plus 1.60% (subject to a further decrease to Term SOFR plus 1.35% or an increase to Term SOFR plus 1.85% based upon average quarterly excess availability under the ABL). The interest rate applicable to the FILO is equal to Term SOFR plus 3.60% (subject to a further decrease to Term SOFR plus 3.35% or an increase to Term SOFR plus 3.85% based on average quarterly excess availability under the FILO). However, for any ABL or FILO with a SOFR interest rate period of six months, the interest rate applicable to the ABL is increased by 30 basis points.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and affirmative covenants, as well as customary negative covenants, that, among other things restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries to: (i) incur liens, (ii) make investments, (iii) issue or incur additional indebtedness, (iv) undergo significant corporate changes, including mergers and acquisitions, (v) make dispositions, (vi) make restricted payments, (vii) prepay other indebtedness and (viii) enter into certain other restrictive agreements. The Company may pay cash dividends and repurchase shares under its share buyback program, subject to certain thresholds of available borrowings based upon the lesser of the aggregate amount of commitments under the Credit Agreement and the borrowing base, determined after giving effect to any such transaction or payment, on a pro forma basis. In addition, the Company must pay a commitment fee per annum on the unused portion of the commitments under the Credit Agreement.
As of January 29, 2022, $99 million in net borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement, and is reflected as long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Availability under the Credit Agreement is determined based upon a monthly borrowing base calculation which includes eligible credit card receivables, real estate and inventory, less outstanding borrowings, letters of credit and certain designated reserves. As of January 29, 2022, the available additional borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement was approximately $167 million, inclusive of $29 million of excess availability.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and believes the following assumptions and estimates are significant to reporting our consolidated results of operations and financial position.
Inventory Valuation and Shrinkage
We identify potentially excess and slow-moving inventories by evaluating inventory aging, turn rates and inventory levels in conjunction with our overall sales trend. Further, inventory realization exposure is identified through analysis of gross margins and markdowns in combination with changes in current business trends. We record excess and slow-moving inventories at net realizable value and may liquidate certain slow-moving inventory through third parties. Historically, the variation of those estimates to actual results is immaterial and material variation is not expected in the future.
We estimate our expected shrinkage of inventories between our physical inventory counts by using average store shrinkage experience rates, which are updated on a regular basis. Historically, the variation of those estimates to actual results is immaterial and material variation is not expected in the future.
Revenue Recognition
Retail sales by our stores are recorded at the point of sale and are net of estimated customer returns, sales discounts under rewards programs and company issued coupons, promotional discounts and employee discounts. For sales from our websites and catalogs, revenue is recognized at the point of shipment. Amounts related to shipping and handling costs billed to customers are recorded in net sales and the related shipping and handling costs are recorded in cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss). Amounts paid by customers to cover shipping and handling costs are immaterial.
We sell gift cards in stores, on our Company-operated e-commerce websites and through third parties. Our gift cards do not have expiration dates. We account for gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time the gift card is sold. The liability is relieved, and revenue is recognized, for gift cards upon redemption. In addition, we recognize revenue for the amount of gift cards expected to go unredeemed (commonly referred to as gift card breakage) under the redemption recognition method. This method records gift card breakage as revenue on a proportional basis over the redemption period based on our historical gift card breakage rate. We determine the gift card breakage rate based on our historical redemption patterns. We recognize revenue on the remaining unredeemed gift cards based on determining that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and that there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions.
Soma offers a points-based loyalty program in which customers earn points based on purchases. Attaining specified loyalty point levels results in the issuance of reward coupons to discount future purchases. As program members accumulate points, we accrue the estimated future liability, adjusted for expected redemption rates and expirations. The liability is relieved and revenue is recognized for loyalty point reward coupons upon redemption. In addition, we recognize revenue on unredeemed points when it can be determined that the likelihood of the point being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the point value. We determined the loyalty point breakage rate based on historical and redemption patterns.
Our policy towards taxes assessed by a government authority directly imposed on revenue producing transactions between a seller and a customer is, and has been, to exclude all such taxes from net sales.
Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
Long-lived assets, including definite-lived assets, are reviewed periodically for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount, an asset is determined to be impaired, and a loss is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. The Company uses market participant rents to calculate the fair value of right of use assets (“ROU”) and discounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group using projected financial information and a discount rate that approximates the cost of capital of a market participant to quantify fair value for other long-lived assets. The asset group is defined as the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available and largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets, which for our retail stores, is primarily at the store level. The estimate of future cash flows requires management to make certain assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and the useful lives of the assets. We exercise our best judgment based on the most current facts and circumstances surrounding our business when applying these impairment rules. We establish our assumptions and arrive at the estimates used in these calculations based upon our historical experience, knowledge of the retail industry and by incorporating third-party data, which we believe results in a reasonably accurate approximation of fair value. Nevertheless, changes in the assumptions used could have an impact on our assessment of recoverability.
We review our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, or when circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the appropriateness of performing a qualitative assessment, on a reporting unit level, based on current circumstances. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. Fair value has historically been determined based on both an income approach and market approach. The income approach is based on estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate that approximates the cost of capital of a market participant, while the market approach is based on sales and EBITDA multiples of similar companies and/or transactions, or other available indications of value. These approaches use significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows and the timing of those cash flows, discount rates reflecting risks inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables. For fiscal 2020, we applied a 100% weighting to the income approach as we were able to provide detailed forecasts for the foreseeable future to perform a discounted cash flow analysis. We did not utilize a market approach in the fair value assessment of the reporting units for fiscal 2020 as the implied EBITDA multiples from the market approach did not yield reasonable fair values given the volatile market conditions at the time of the assessments. Estimating the fair value is judgmental in nature, which could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charges. Goodwill impairment charges are calculated as the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value up to the amount of reported goodwill.
We review our other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or when circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the appropriateness of performing a qualitative assessment based on current circumstances. If the results of the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow method, based on the relief from royalty concept.
Operating Leases
Rent expense under store operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases. Landlord incentives, “rent-free” periods, rent escalation clauses and other fixed rental expenses are also amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases, including the construction period. This is generally 60-90 days prior to the store opening date, when we generally begin improvements in preparation for our intended use. Variable rental expenses are recognized as incurred. Tenant improvement allowances, fixed rent escalation clauses and impairments are included within right of use assets.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance, which requires the use of the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of existing tax law and published guidance as applicable to our operations. Deferred tax assets are reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance to the extent future realization of those tax benefits are uncertain. Our effective tax rate considers management’s judgment of expected tax liabilities within the various taxing jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax.
We record amounts for uncertain tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. Consequently, changes in our assumptions and judgments could affect amounts recognized related to income tax uncertainties and may affect our consolidated results of operations or financial position. We believe our assumptions for estimates continue to be reasonable, although actual results may have a positive or negative material impact on the balances of such tax positions. Historically, the variation of estimates to actual results is immaterial and material variation is not expected in the future.
Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements
