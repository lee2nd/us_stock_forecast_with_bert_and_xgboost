Overview and Plan of Operations
In Fiscal 2021, sales of drug tests were still being negatively impacted by the price competitiveness in our core markets (government, employment and clinical) and by the Covid-19 pandemic. Sales related to Covid-19 testing also declined dramatically in Fiscal 2021 compared to sales in Fiscal 2020. In addition to the marketing of our drug tests, in Fiscal 2021, we continued to market various Covid-19 rapid tests. In December 2020, we announced that were distributing a rapid Covid-19 antigen test. Very early in Fiscal 2021, we were informed by the manufacturer (Healgen Scientific, LLC) that we could no longer offer the Covid-19 antigen test for sale in the United States. We were able to secure another distribution relationship for another rapid antigen test in May 2021 along with a few other rapid antigen tests throughout Fiscal 2021.
We are also distributing Covid-19 antibody tests, including but not limited to an antibody test via distribution with Healgen which is for use with whole blood, serum or plasma and can be used by laboratories able to perform moderate or highly complex testing (a more limited market), and an antibody test from another manufacturer which can be performed using finger stick blood at the point of care and by laboratories with a Certificate of CLIA waiver (a larger market). However, the need for rapid Covid-19 antibody tests declined significantly in Fiscal 2021 due to widespread vaccine availability.
In addition to rapid antigen and antibody tests, in Fiscal 2021 we also marketed (via distribution) the Co-Diagnostics Logix Smart Covid-19 test, a Covid-19-Influenza A/B combination test and at home rapid antigen tests (although lack of availability of at-home tests severely limited our ability to achieve sales of the product).
All of the Covid-19 tests we are offering are being marketed in accordance with the March 2020 Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) policy set forth by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in accordance with the individual EUAs issued for the products.
Throughout Fiscal 2021, we continued to offer other products via distribution relationships. We currently offer a lower-cost alternative for onsite drug testing, point of care products for certain infectious diseases and alternative drug testing sample methods. With the exception of the lower-cost drug test alternative, these offerings have yet to materially positively impact sales.
We do expect to sell more Covid-19 testing products and positively impact our revenues in the year ending December 31, 2022, however we do not expect the sales to materially impact our business, our financial condition and/or results of operations.
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we are still not marketing our oral fluid drug tests (OralStat®) in the employment and insurance markets in the United States (under a limited exemption set forth by the FDA). We remain hopeful that we can effectively market our OralStat in the United States markets given its superior sensitivity and accuracy. Initially we may re-introduce the product in markets outside the United States via distribution relationships.
In the year ended December 31, 2019, we expanded our contract manufacturing operations with two (2) new customers. Unfortunately, the Covid-19 pandemic halted sales to these new customers and resulted in no sales in Fiscal 2020. In Fiscal 2021, we started to ship orders to them again and our contract manufacturing sales increased in Fiscal 2021 when compared to Fiscal 2020.
In Fiscal 2021 and beyond, we are focusing our efforts on further penetration of our markets with both current and new products (drug testing, Covid-19 and other diagnostic tests). We are also looking for avenues to capitalize on our US manufacturing operations. In early 2021 we started exploring the retention of a marketing firm that would provide services related to public relations/social media to effectively communicate our manufacturing capabilities. There was an unforeseen delay on the part of the firm and presently discussions are halted.
Gross profit margin declined in Fiscal 2021 when compared to Fiscal 2020 primarily due to the increased costs of manufacturing in the United States and the widespread availability of product manufactured outside the United States; all of which are offered at significantly lower prices. We continually take actions to adjust our production schedules to try to mitigate future manufacturing inefficiencies and we closely examine our gross profit margins.
Operating expenses declined in Fiscal 2021 when compared to Fiscal 2020. We continuously make efforts to control operational expenses to ensure they are in line with sales and we will continue these efforts into the year ending December 31, 2022. We have continued to consolidate job responsibilities in certain areas of the Company as a result of employee retirement and other departures resulting in personnel reductions.
From August 2013 until June 2020, we maintained a 10% salary deferral program for our sole executive officer, our Chief Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer Melissa Waterhouse. The salary deferral program was initiated by Ms. Waterhouse voluntarily. Another member of senior management participated in the program voluntarily until his retirement in November 2019. After the member of senior management retired, we agreed to make payments on the deferred compensation owed to this individual. In Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, we made payments of $20,000 and $57,000, respectively. The deferred compensation owed to this individual was paid in full in May 2021. Once the deferred compensation was paid in full to this individual, we began to make payments at the same rate to Ms. Waterhouse given the length of time the amount had been owed and that the last payment (prior to May 2021) made to Ms. Waterhouse was in August 2017. In Fiscal 2021, we made payments totaling $33,000 to Ms. Waterhouse. We did not make any payments on deferred compensation to Ms. Waterhouse in Fiscal 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had deferred compensation owed to Ms. Waterhouse in the amount of $74,000 and $5,000 in payroll taxes that are due as payments are made to Ms. Waterhouse; for a total of $79,000 in deferred compensation.
Our continued existence is dependent upon several factors, including our ability to: 1) raise revenue levels even though the drug testing market continues to be infiltrated by product manufactured outside of the United States as well as being impacted by the global health crisis caused by Covid-19, 2) further penetrate the markets (in and outside of the United States) for Covid-19 tests, 3) secure new contract manufacturing customers, 4) control operational costs to generate positive cash flows, 5) maintain our current credit facilities or refinance our current credit facilities if necessary, and 6) if needed, obtain working capital by selling additional shares of our common stock either to Lincoln Park or through an alternative method if necessary.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or “U.S. GAAP”. Part IV, Item 15, Note A to our financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements. The accounting policies that we believe are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the financial statements include the following:
Inventory and Allowance for Slow Moving and Obsolete Inventory: We maintain an allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory. If necessary, actual write-downs to inventory are made for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based on historical demand and past sales history of the products which utilize the inventory. We have reviewed all items within the allowance at December 31, 2021 and based upon that review, we do not expect any future additions to the allowance based on obsolescence, however if actual market conditions are less favorable for our products, additional inventory allowances or write-downs may be required to address slow-moving materials.
Valuation of Receivables: We estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts based on facts, circumstances and judgments regarding each receivable. Customer payment history and patterns, length of relationship with the customer, historical losses, economic and political conditions, trends and individual circumstances are among the items considered when evaluating the collectability of the receivables. Accounts are reviewed regularly for collectability and those deemed uncollectible are written off. If our customers’ economic condition changes, we may need to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts.
Estimates of the fair value of stock options and warrants at date of grant: The fair value of stock options (share-based payment expense) issued to employees, members of our Board of Directors and consultants is estimated (on the date of grant) based on the Black-Scholes options-pricing model utilizing certain assumptions for a risk free interest rate; volatility; and expected remaining lives of the awards. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. Our share-based payment expense in Fiscal 2021 was $0 and only $2,000 in Fiscal 2020. However, we may issue stock options in the future. If factors change and we use different assumptions, our equity-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. In estimating our forfeiture rate, we analyzed our historical forfeiture rate, the remaining lives of unvested options (if applicable), and the amount of vested options as a percentage of total options outstanding. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, or if we reevaluate the forfeiture rate, equity-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period.
Use of Estimates: We make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020
Net Sales: Net sales decreased 46.5%, or $1,929,000, in Fiscal 2021 when compared to Fiscal 2020. The majority of the decline ($1,559,000) is related to products that we distribute and $1,519,000 of that decline is related to distribution of Covid-19 tests. In Fiscal 2020, we sold $1,572,000 in Covid-19 tests while in Fiscal 2021, we only sold $54,000. Throughout most of Fiscal 2020, rapid Covid-19 antibody tests dominated the market and the vast majority of our rapid Covid-19 test sales in Fiscal 2020 were rapid antibody tests. However, in Fiscal 2021, rapid Covid-19 antigen tests were becoming more sought after as more Covid-19 antigen tests were EUA issued and as vaccines became more widely available. In December 2020, we announced that were distributing a rapid Covid-19 antigen test. Very early in Fiscal 2021, we were informed by the manufacturer (Healgen Scientific, LLC) that their rapid Covid-19 antigen test could no longer be offered for sale in the United States. This resulted in an interruption in our supply chain negatively impacted our Covid-19 test sales as our current customers had to seek alternative suppliers for their Covid-19 antigen testing needs. We were able to secure another distribution relationship for another rapid antigen test in May 2021 along with a few other rapid antigen tests throughout Fiscal 2021. Sales of these new tests did nominally offset the decline in Covid-19 test sales. In Fiscal 2021, we also distributed a rapid Covid-19 antibody test which can be performed using finger stick blood at the point of care and by laboratories with a Certificate of CLIA waiver and at-home rapid Covid-19 antigen tests. However, the supply chain for at home, rapid antigen tests became very unstable in the latter part of Fiscal 2021 and lack of availability of tests negatively impacted our ability to secure more sales of the tests.
Drugs of abuse (“DOA”) manufacturing sales also decreased by $518,000 in Fiscal 2021 when compared to Fiscal 2020. Sales of drug tests continue to be negatively impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic along with the price competitive nature of our markets. In addition, throughout Fiscal 2021 we experienced supply chain issues; particularly with plastics and other materials that are used to manufacture our drug tests; materials that are also used in the manufacture of lateral flow Covid-19 tests. The lead times for some materials increased significantly and in most cases without notice. These delays impacted our ability to complete manufacturing and ship products. Throughout Fiscal 2021, customers still requiring a lower amount of tests due to reduced workforce, telecommuting and reduced budgets (especially in the government market as financial resources are still being used for Covid-19 testing and vaccinations). Also contributing to the decline in DOA manufacturing sales, when comparing Fiscal 2021 to Fiscal 2020, is a decline in clinical sales and the loss of a government account in the middle of 2020 (due to pricing) and sales declines in the international market due to two orders received in 2020 that were not received in 2021.
Contract manufacturing sales increased by $141,000 in Fiscal 2021 compared to Fiscal 2020. Sales to all of our contract manufacturing customers increased year over year. This includes sales from two customers whose orders halted in 2020 due to the pandemic. The most significant increase was in sales of RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) test and malaria tests.
Gross profit: Gross profit decreased to 24.7% of net sales in Fiscal 2021 compared to 29.8% of sales in Fiscal 2020. DOA manufacturing gross profit declined year over year; most of which is due to increased costs of manufacturing (materials and labor costs associated with manufacturing), manufacturing inefficiencies due to decreased DOA sales and product mix (certain product lines, such as InCup, are more heavily impacted by increased costs associated with labor). Manufacturing inefficiencies occur when production levels decrease but, not all costs can be reduced to be in line with production levels because they are fixed. A price increase that went into effect in the middle of Fiscal 2021 did partially offset these increases. Distribution gross profit increased in Fiscal 2021 when compared to Fiscal 2020. The primary reason for the increase in distribution sales is Fiscal 2020 included high volume Covid-19 tests sales that were sold at lower profit margins and sales of newly sourced (in Fiscal 2021) Covid-19 tests are being sold at higher rate of gross profit. And finally, contract manufacturing gross profit declined between Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2021. Increased material costs and product mix were the cause of the decrease in gross profit.
Operating Expenses: Operating expenses for Fiscal 2021 decreased 7.1%, or $132,000, when compared to operating expenses in Fiscal 2020. Expenses related to Research and Development and Selling and Marketing decreased, while expenses related to General and Administrative costs increased. More specifically:
Research and development (“R&D”)
R&D expenses for Fiscal 2021 decreased 5.6%, or $5,000, when compared to R&D expenses incurred in Fiscal 2020. The primary reason for the decline in expense is decreased supplies and material costs due to a study that was conducted in Fiscal 2020 but, not required in Fiscal 2021. All other expenses remained relatively consistent year over year. Throughout Fiscal 2021, our R&D department primarily focused their efforts on the enhancement of our current products and required validations related to drug testing product components.
Selling and marketing
Selling and marketing expenses for Fiscal 2021 decreased by 38.3%, or $189,000, when compared to selling and marketing expenses in Fiscal 2020. The primary reason for the decrease in selling and marketing expense is lower commissions paid related as sales of Covid-19 tests decreased. Also contributing to the decline in expense were reductions in sales salary expense and benefits (due to the termination of personnel) and car allowance expense (due to the same terminations). Partially offsetting the declines was increased promotional expense (i.e. fees paid to OTC Markets in Fiscal 2021).
In Fiscal 2021, we continued selling and marketing efforts related to our drug tests and we continued to take actions to secure new contract manufacturing customers. In addition, we promoted lower cost alternatives for onsite drug testing and point of care products for infectious disease (through relationships with third parties). We also marketed and sold rapid Covid-19 tests via distribution relationships. These offerings did not result in increased selling and marketing expenses when comparing Fiscal 2021 to Fiscal 2020 due to lower sales of Covid-19 tests in Fiscal 2021. Although we decreased the size of our sales force in Fiscal 2020, the terminations of sales personnel in Fiscal 2020 were made for performance reasons. Throughout Fiscal 2021, we took steps to increase the size of our sales team to further penetrate our markets; however, no new sales reps were hired in Fiscal 2021.
General and administrative (“G&A”)
G&A expense increased 4.9%, or $62,000, in Fiscal 2021 when compared to G&A expense in Fiscal 2020. The majority of the increase is due to bank service fees, which increased $91,000 between Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2021. Most of this increase is due to $149,000 in expense related to the refinancing of the Cherokee facilities in February 2021. The expense consisted of penalties in the amount of $120,000, a fee paid to Cantone Research, Inc. in the amount of $28,000 and $1,000 in Cherokee legal fees. Fiscal 2020 only included a $20,000 penalty associated with the extension of the Cherokee facilities in February 2020 but, Fiscal 2020 also included higher bank fees associated with credit card payments received for a higher level of Covid-19 test sales in Fiscal 2020. Also increasing were insurance costs, cost associated with our ISO audit in Fiscal 2021, utility costs and costs associated with maintenance of our intellectual property. These increases were partially offset by decreased director’s fees and expenses (due to a smaller number of board members and meetings being held telephonically), G&A salaries and benefits (due to decreased personnel) and legal fees (due to completion of Lincoln Park financing in Jan 2021 and less securities counsel work).
There was $0 in share based payment expense in Fiscal 2021 as all previously issued options have been completely amortized. There was $2,000 of share based payment expense in Fiscal 2020.
Other income and expense:
Other income of $718,000 in Fiscal 2021 consisted of income related to the forgiveness of our PPP loan in the amount of $335,000, other income of $58,000; which is $50,000 related to certain non-refundable prepayments (customer deposits) that were forfeited when the customer did not remit the remaining amounts due on the order and $8,000 in income related to gains on certain liabilities, $619,000 in income from the Employee Retention Credit recognized in Fiscal 2021 (which is $44,000 in credits taken in Q3 2021, $38,000 in credit taken in Q4 2021 and $537,000 in refunds filed for credits in the first three quarters of 2021). This income was offset by interest expense associated with our credit facilities (our line of credit, our two loans with Cherokee Financial, LLC and a shareholder loan) and a charge related to the impairment of our patent asset.
Other expense of $173,000 in Fiscal 2020 consisted of interest expense associated with our credit facilities (our line of credit, equipment loan with Crestmark Bank and our two loans with Cherokee Financial, LLC) nominally offset by $2,000 in other income.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2021
Our cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including but not limited to manufacturing costs (such as raw materials, labor, equipment, etc.), selling and marketing initiatives, product development activities, regulatory costs, legal costs, and effective management of inventory levels and production levels in response to sales history and forecasts. We expect to devote capital resources related to selling and marketing initiatives. We are examining other growth opportunities including strategic alliances and contract manufacturing. Given our current and historical cash position, such activities would need to be funded from the issuance of additional equity or additional credit borrowings, subject to market and other conditions. The following transactions materially impacted our liquidity and cash flow in Fiscal 2021:
Lincoln Park Equity Line
On December 9, 2020, we entered into a Purchase Agreement and a Registration Rights Agreement with Lincoln Park under which Lincoln Park agreed to purchase from the Company, from time to time, up to $10,250,000 of shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Purchase Agreement, over a two year period. On December 29, 2020 we filed a Form S-1 Registration Statement (the “Registration Statement”). We amended the Registration Statement on January 7, 2021 and the SEC declared the Registration Statement effective on January 11, 2021. In Fiscal 2021, the Company sold 6,500,000 shares of common stock to Lincoln Park (including 500,000 shares required as an initial purchase under the Purchase Agreement) as Regular Purchases and received proceeds of $639,000.
Employee Retention Credit
As indicated in Note K to our Financial Statements, in August 2021, our payroll service provider processed and mailed a Form 941-X to claim an Employee Retention Credit (“ERC”) refund in the amount of $202,000 on qualified wages paid in the first quarter of Fiscal 2021. Due to a change in the Form 941-X, our payroll service provider did not process and mail our Form 941-X to claim an ERC refund in the amount of $198,000 on qualified wages paid in the second quarter of Fiscal 2021 until October 28, 2021. In the middle of the third quarter of Fiscal 2021, we began taking the ERC in our current payroll; which reduced our payroll by approximately $44,000 in the third quarter of 2021 and $38,000 in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2021 (until the ERC program was ended early as part of the Infrastructure bill signed into law on November 15, 2021). Given this, we did not have to amend our Form 941 for the third quarter of 2021; rather our Form 941 claiming a refund in the amount of $137,000 was filed electronically with the IRS on November 1, 2021 by our payroll service provider. On December 28, 2021, we received our refund for the third quarter of Fiscal 2021 in the amount of $137,000. Shortly before receiving our first refund, we spoke with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to obtain statuses of our filings. It was then that we were informed that they did not have record of receiving our Form 941-X for the first quarter of Fiscal 2021 (which was mailed by our service provider in August 2021). We re-sent the Form 941-X for the first quarter of Fiscal 2021 via overnight service on December 31, 2021 and the IRS received it on January 5, 2022. This lack of receipt will result in a delay in receiving our expected refund in the amount of $203,000. Based on our discussion with the IRS, we were expecting the refund payment for the second quarter of Fiscal 2020 sometime in February 2022; however, as of the date of this report, we have not received any further refund payments.
Securities Purchase Agreement - October 2021
On October 18, 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with a non-affiliated, accredited investor (the “Investor”), pursuant to which we sold to the Investor in a private placement (the “Private Placement”), 2,500,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Common Share”), at a price per Common Share of $0.04 (the “Purchase Price”) for gross (and net) proceeds of $100,000 as there were no costs associated with the Private Placement.
Shareholder Loans - December 2021
On December 14, 2021, we entered into six month Loan Agreements with two non-affiliated investors resulting in gross (and net) proceeds of $75,000 as there were no costs associated with the loans. The loans bear interest of 7% per annum until principal and interest are both due in full, or until June 15, 2022. We paid one of the investors their first interest payment (due on March 15, 2022); however, the other investor agreed to waive their first interest payment and have the interest paid at the end of the term of the loan along with the final interest and principal; due June 15, 2022, or earlier as we receive further ERC refunds.
Going Concern
Our financial statements for Fiscal 2021 were prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern, which assumes the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our current cash balances, together with cash generated from future operations, ERC refunds and amounts available under our credit facilities (including the Lincoln Park equity facility) may not be sufficient to fund operations through April 2023. At December 31, 2021, we have Stockholders’ Deficit of $944,000.
Our loan and security agreement and 2019 Term Note with Cherokee for $900,000 and $220,000, respectively, expired on February 15, 2021; however, on February 24, 2021, we completed a transaction with Cherokee related to (second) one-year Extension Agreements dated February 14, 2021 under which Cherokee extended the due date of the Cherokee LSA ($900,000) and the 2019 Term Loan with Cherokee ($220,000) again; the facilities were previously extended in February 2020). Under the terms of the (second) extensions, the $900,000 (secured) Cherokee LSA was increased to $1,000,000 to include a $100,000 penalty that was due as a result of the Company being unable to pay back the principal in February 2021; a term that was included in the February 2020 extension. The annual interest rate on the (further) extended Cherokee LSA was increased to a fixed rate of 10% (the prior fixed rate was 8%) plus a 1% annual oversight fee (that remained unchanged). In addition, the 2019 Cherokee Term Loan was increased to $240,000 to include a $20,000 penalty that was due as a result of the Company being unable to pay back the principal balance to Cherokee in February 2021; a term that was included in the February 2020 extension. Our total debt at December 31, 2021 with Cherokee Financial, LLC was $1,240,000. We do not expect cash from operations within the next 12 months to be sufficient to pay the amounts due under these credit facilities, which was due in full on February 15, 2022. We were not able to these credit facilities when they were due and we are currently in discussions with Cherokee related to possible payoff of the loans (via a refinance) or to extend the due date of the loans. See Note L - Subsequent Events for information related to the status of the Cherokee loans.
Throughout Fiscal 2021, we had a line of credit with Crestmark Bank. The maximum availability on the line of credit is $1,000,000. However, because the amount available under the line of credit is based upon our accounts receivable, the amounts actually available under our line of credit (historically) have been significantly less than the maximum availability. When sales levels decline, we have reduced availability on our line of credit due to decreased accounts receivable balances. As of December 31, 2021, based on our availability calculation, there were no additional amounts available under the line of credit because we draw any balance available on a daily basis. Upon completion of the initial 5 year term, the Crestmark line of credit automatically renews for additional one (1) year terms unless notice of termination from the Company is received by Crestmark not less than sixty (60) days prior to the end of the renewal term. We did not provide Crestmark with a notice of non-renewal and therefore, the Crestmark line of credit automatically renewed on June 22, 2021 for another one year term, or until June 22, 2022.
If availability under our line of credit, cash received from equity sales under the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement and/or cash received as refunds under the ERC program are not sufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, we will be required to obtain additional credit facilities or sell additional equity securities, or delay capital expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on our business. There is no assurance that such financing will be available or that we will be able to complete financing on satisfactory terms, if at all.
As of December 31, 2021, we had the following debt/credit facilities:
(1) Facility was not repaid on February 15, 2022 and we are currently in discussions with Cherokee related to possible payoff of the facility (via a refinance) or to extend the due date of the facility.
Working Capital Deficit
At the end of Fiscal 2021, we were operating at a working capital deficit of $1,484,000. This compares to a working capital deficit of $841,000 at the end of Fiscal 2020. This increase in working capital deficit is primarily a result of our loans with Cherokee Financial, LLC being classified as long-term debt in Fiscal 2020 and short term debt in Fiscal 2021, partially offset by the forgiveness of the PPP loan in Fiscal 2021. We have historically satisfied working capital requirements through cash from operations, bank debt and private placements of our securities.
Dividends
We have never paid any dividends on our common shares and we anticipate that all future earnings, if any, will be retained for use in our business.
Cash Flow, Outlook/Risk
In Fiscal 2021, we had a net loss of $463,000 and net cash used in operating activities of $673,000.
Our cash position increased from $98,000 at December 31, 2020 to $115,000 at December 31, 2021. Cash at both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021 was positively impacted by proceeds received late in each year; the Lincoln Park transaction in December 2020 (in the amount of $125,000) and an ERC refund in December 2021 (in the amount of $137,000).
In Fiscal 2020, along with the Lincoln Park proceeds previously discussed, we reserved cash by paying a refinance fee and director attendance fees in shares of restricted stock and converted a loan into restricted shares of stock. We also completed a private placement of securities in February 2020. In Fiscal 2021, along with the ERC refund previously discussed, we reserved cash by paying interest in shares of restricted stock. We also received proceeds from 1) sales of common stock under our equity line of credit with Lincoln Park ($639,000), 2) a private placement of securities in October 2021 ($100,000) and 3) two shareholder loans in December 2021 (totaling $75,000). Our PPP loan was also forgiven in Fiscal 2021. However, in February 2021, we also incurred penalties in the amount of $120,000 from Cherokee Financial, LLC because we could not pay back our loans in full on February 15, 2021.
While the Covid-19 pandemic is seemingly winding down, we continue to be impacted by it in the form of material delays, cost increases (in both manufacturing and other business costs), labor shortages and decreased sales orders from customers. We are unsure as to how long we will continue to be impacted negatively. The extent to which the pandemic may continue to impact our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are still uncertain and cannot be predicted. If we, our customers or suppliers experience (or in some cases continue to experience) business disruptions, our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition are likely to be materially adversely affected, and our ability to access the capital markets may be limited.
We have been able to utilize the Lincoln Park Equity Line; however, in the latter part of Fiscal 2021, purchases were limited due to the downturn of our common stock. We only completed one regular purchase in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2021. All proceeds have been used for working capital.
In December 2021, we received one of our ERC refunds (in the amount of $137,000) from the IRS. In Fiscal 2022, we are expecting two more refunds; one in the amount of $203,000 and the other in the amount of $197,000; for a total of $400,000.
Our ability to repay our current debt and other liabilities may also be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory, legal, business and other factors beyond our control, including those discussed herein. If we are unable to meet our credit facility obligations and we are unable to facilitate purchases under our Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park, we will be required to raise money through new equity and/or debt financing(s) and, there is no assurance that we would be able to find new financing, or that any new financing would be at favorable terms.
We will continue to take steps to ensure that operating expenses and manufacturing costs remain in line with sales levels. We have consolidated job responsibilities in certain areas of the Company and this has enabled us to implement personnel reductions. Sales declines result in lower cash balances and lower availability on our line of credit at times. We are promoting new products and service offerings to diversify our revenue stream, including new Covid-19 tests.
If we are forced to refinance our debt on less favorable terms, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by increased costs and rates. There is also no assurance that we could obtain alternative debt facilities. We may also be forced to pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as restructuring, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures or seeking additional equity capital. There can be no assurances that any of these strategies could be implemented on satisfactory terms, if at all.
If events and circumstances occur such that 1) we do not meet our current operating plans to increase sales, 2) we are unable to raise sufficient additional equity or debt financing, 3) we are unable to effect sales under the Lincoln Park Equity Line, 4) we are unable to utilize equity as a form of payment in lieu of cash or 5) our credit facilities are insufficient or not available, we may be required to further reduce expenses or take other steps which could have a material adverse effect on our future performance.
