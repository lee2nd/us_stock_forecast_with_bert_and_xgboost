Results of Operations
Result of operations for the FYE February 28, 2022 compared to 2021 (of HotPlay) are as follows:
Revenue
● Total revenue amounted to $8.2 million, compares very favorably to $0 revenue in the last year of HotPlay. Zappware N.V. achieved $4.5 million revenue from subscription services and $2.0 million revenue from product development as a result from high demand in digital media content, NextBank International generated $1.6 million revenue from interest and bank services as a result from increase in real estate and other commercial loans and NextTrip generated $0.16 million as a result of global pandemic recovery and travel restriction relief.
Cost of revenue
● Cost of revenue amounted to $2.3 million in line with the revenue, compared to $0 cost in the last year of HotPlay. Cost of media subscription and services amounted to $1.3 million, product development cost amounted to $0.4 million, interest and bank service cost amounted to $0.5 million and cost related to travel service amounted to $0.1 million.
Gross profit margin
● Gross profit totaled $5.9 million (71%) compared to $0 of HotPlay in the last year. For the year ended 28 February 2022, NextMedia segment generated gross profits of $4.8 million and NextFinTech segment generated gross profits of $1.1 million.
Net operating loss
● Net operating loss totaled $20.7 million compared to $1.6 million last year of HotPlay as some businesses were in pre-operating stage last year, which amount consisted mainly of employee expenses $5.2 million, depreciation and amortization $5.7 million, legal, consulting and professional fee $6 million.
Net loss
● Net loss totaled $40.4 million compared to $1.6 million last year of HotPlay, which consistent mainly of certain non-recurring and non-cash such as impairment loss of asset $11.6 million, allowance for note receivables $3.1 million and loss from valuation $2.4 million.
In FYE2022 and the subsequent period, the Company completed the reverse acquisition of Monaker Group in June 2021 and four major acquisitions as of the filing date of this Report. Management believes that the acquisition of GoPlay game portfolio and tournament platform, and subsequent integration with HotPlay will accelerate the launch of a comprehensive gaming solution that could help operators and platforms meaningfully increase user engagement while realizing an alternative revenue stream. In the FinTech division, NextBank has been steadily growing deposits and access to credit lines, generating revenue via the origination and selling of loans. As we transition NextBank to a digital bank, management is determined to develop an integrated FinTech platform that offers digital banking, investments into alternative assets, and insurance products.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
On February 28, 2022, we had $6.6 million of cash and cash equivalent, which was an increase of $6.2 million from $0.4 million at February 28, 2021. The increase in cash and cash equivalent was mainly attributed to net proceeds received from financing activities of $20.4 million, and cash providing by investing activities of $7.9 million, offset by cash used in operating activities of $22.0 million.
As of February 28, 2022, the Company had total current liabilities of $27.5 million, consisting mainly of accounts payable and accrued expense of $8.6 million as well as other liabilities - customer deposits of $7.6 million. We anticipate that we will satisfy these amounts from proceeds derived from equity sales, sales of marketable securities, financing, cash and cash equivalent and revenue generated from sales.
As of February 28, 2022, we had $99.8 million in total assets, $31.9 million in total liabilities, working capital of $6.3 million and a total accumulated deficit of $39.2 million.
Net cash used in operating activities increased to $22.0 million for the FYE February 28, 2022, compared to $1.0 million of the FYE February 28, 2021. The increase was mainly the result of the Company’s net loss from operations, payments relating to prepaid expenses for software, licenses and games along with increases in assets.
Net cash provided by investing activities increased to $7.9 million for the FYE February 28, 2022, as compared to net cash used for investing activities of $5.6 million for FYE February 28, 2021. The increase was mainly from the effects of business combinations of NextPlay and NextBank during FY22.
Net cash provided by financing activities increased to $20.4 million for the FYE February 28, 2022, compared to $7.0 million for the FYE February 28, 2021. The increase was primarily due to (i) funds received from the sale of common stock, amounting to $27.9 million; (ii) loans from Streeterville amounted to $2.1 million; and (iii) the repayment of notes to Streeterville, amounting to $9.7 million.
Additional information regarding our notes payable, notes receivable, investments in equity instruments, acquisitions and dispositions and line of credit can be found under “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” - “Note 4 - Acquisitions and Dispositions”, “Note 5 - Related Party Transactions”, “Note 7 - Notes Receivable” and “Note 16 - Subsequent Events”.
We have limited financial resources. As of February 28, 2022, we have working capital of $6.3 million. Our monthly cash requirement is approximately $1.5 million for over twelve months.
We will need to raise additional capital or borrow loans to support our on-going operations, increase market penetration of our products, expand the marketing and development of our travel and technology driven products, repay debt obligations, provide capital expenditures for additional equipment and development costs, satisfy payment obligations, and to implement systems for managing the business, including covering other operating costs until our planned revenue streams from all businesses and products are fully implemented and begin to offset our operating costs. Our failure to obtain additional capital to finance our working capital needs on acceptable terms, or at all, would negatively impact our business, financial condition, and liquidity. We currently have limited resources to satisfy these obligations, and our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business and ability to continue as a going concern. As indicated by the increase of the Company’s deferred revenue balance as of February 28, 2022, $2.1 million, we expect to see an increase in revenue in next year.
Management’s plans with regard to this going concern are as follows:
(i) the Company plans to continue to raise funds by way of public or private offerings;
(ii) the Company is working aggressively to increase the viewership of its FinTech and gaming products by promoting it across other mediums;
(iii) the Company expects growth in revenue from interest and non-interest income through organic growth and new business initiatives in the FinTech division;
(iv) the Company plans to issue tokens under its Longroot entity during the year 2023, which is expected to result in generating revenues;
(v)
the Company is tightening its spending on expenses, which is expected to help in the cost reduction of the operations; and
(vi) In March 2022, the Company created an at-the-market equity program under which the Company may, from time to time, and so long as there is an effective registration statement covering the shares issuable thereunder in place, offer and sell shares of its common stock in an aggregate gross offering price of up to $20 million to or through the agent pursuant to the ATM Offering.
The Company’s registration statement on Form S-3 (SEC File No. 333-257457), including the accompanying prospectus and any related prospectus supplement, is subject to the provisions of General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3, which provides that the Company may not sell securities in a public primary offering with a value exceeding one-third of its public float in any twelve-month period unless its public float is at least $75 million. As of August 31, 2021, the Company’s public float (i.e., the aggregate market value of its outstanding equity securities held by non-affiliates) was approximately $55 million, based on the closing price per share of the Company’s common stock, as reported on the Nasdaq Capital Market on August 31, 2021, as calculated in accordance with General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3. If the Company’s public float meets or exceeds $75 million at any time, the Company will no longer be subject to the restrictions set forth in General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3, at least until the filing of its next Section 10(a)(3) update as required under the Securities Act.
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company’s ability to further implement its business plan and generate greater revenues. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and generate additional revenues provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern.
Known Trends or Uncertainties
Although we have not seen any significant reduction in revenues to date, we have seen some consolidation in our industry during economic downturns. These consolidations have not had a negative effect on our total sales; however, should consolidations and downsizing in the industry continue to occur, those events could adversely impact our revenues and earnings going forward.
As discussed in the Risk Factors section of this Report, the world has been affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Until the pandemic has passed, there remains uncertainty as to the effect of COVID-19 on our business in both the short and long-term.
The potential for growth in new markets is uncertain. We will continue to explore these opportunities until such time as we either generate sales or determine that resources would be more efficiently used elsewhere.
Inflation
Inflation has increased during the periods covered by this Report, and is expected to continue to increase for the near future. Inflationary factors, such as increases in interest rates, overhead costs and transportation costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, we may experience some effect in the near future (especially if inflation rates continue to rise) due to supply chain constraints, consequences associated with COVID-19 and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, employee availability and wage increases.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements.

The November 2020 Investor Note was subsequently funded in full in January 2021.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected.
Our significant accounting policies, methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations. We believe that the policies involve the greatest degree of complexity and judgment by our management and are critical for understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. If actual results significantly differ from the Company’s estimates, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted.
Significant accounting policies, methods, estimates and judgments are described in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” - “Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
