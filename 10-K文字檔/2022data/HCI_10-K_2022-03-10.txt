The important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements include but are not limited to the effect of governmental regulation; changes in insurance regulations; the frequency and extent of claims; uncertainties inherent in reserve estimates; catastrophic events; changes in the demand for, pricing of, availability of or collectability of reinsurance; restrictions on our ability to change premium rates; increased rate pressure on premiums; the impact of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic; and other risks and uncertainties and other factors listed under Item 1A -- “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
OVERVIEW
General
HCI Group, Inc. is a Florida-based company which through its subsidiaries is engaged in a variety of business activities, including property and casualty insurance, reinsurance, real estate and information technology. Its principal business is property and casualty insurance.
We began insurance operations by participating in a “take-out program” which is a legislatively mandated program designed to encourage private companies to assume policies from Citizens, a Florida state-sponsored insurance carrier. Opportunities to acquire large numbers of policies from Citizens meeting our strict underwriting criteria have diminished in recent years. We may, however, selectively pursue additional assumption transactions with Citizens.
Our general operating and growth strategies are to continually optimize our existing book of insurance business, organically expand our insurance business, manage our costs and expenses, diversify our business operations, develop and deploy new technologies to streamline operational processes, and maintain a strong balance sheet so we can quickly pursue accretive opportunities when they arise. Our growth strategies also include assumption of policies from other insurance companies with the intention of renewing and/or replacing them with our policies eventually.
Recent Developments
On January 20, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per common share. The dividends are to be paid March 18, 2022 to stockholders of record on February 18, 2022.
On February 23, 2022, we entered into an agreement with United for United’s primary insurance subsidiary, United Property & Casualty Insurance Company, to cede to us all of its personal lines insurance business in the states of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Under the reinsurance agreement, HCPCI provides 85% quota share reinsurance on all of United’s personal lines insurance business in those states from December 31, 2021 through May 31, 2022. Similar to the previous agreement, HCPCI paid United a catastrophe allowance of 9% of premium not exceeding $3,800,000 and a provisional ceding commission of 25% of premium. That percentage could increase up to 32% depending on the direct loss ratio results from the reinsured business. Annual premiums from the assumed business approximate $87,000,000. We also entered into a renewal rights agreement with United in connection with the assumed business in the three states. Under the renewal rights agreement, we have the right to renew and/or replace United’s insurance policies at the end of their respective policy periods in the three states. Our ability to replace policies is subject to regulatory approvals in the three states. In connection with the transaction, United will agree to not compete with us for the issuance of personal lines homeowners business in these three states until July 1, 2025. As part of the transaction, United will receive a renewal rights ceding commission of 6%, with a portion of the ceding commission paid up-front.
On March 1, 2022, none of the holders of the 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes exercised the put option, which would have required us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of the notes at par.
In March 2022, our share repurchase forward contract with Societe Generale, entered into in conjunction with the 2017 issuance of the 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes, was physically settled with the delivery from Societe Generale of 191,100 shares of HCI’s common stock to us.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2021 with the Year Ended December 31, 2020
Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflect net income of approximately $7,242,000, or $0.21 diluted earnings per share, compared with a net income of approximately $27,580,000, or $3.49 diluted earnings per share, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The year-over-year decrease was primarily attributable to a one-time gain on involuntary conversion of approximately $36,969,000 included in our 2020 results, offset by a net increase in income from our investment portfolio (consisting of net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains or losses) of approximately $14,538,000.
Revenue
Gross Premiums Earned for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $577,044,000 and $415,918,000, respectively. The $161,126,000 increase in 2021 was primarily attributable to the policies assumed from United Insurance Holdings Corporation and increased policies in force from the growth in TypTap’s business, offset by a normal decrease due to policy attrition. Gross premiums earned in 2021 related to the United policies assumed were $98,498,000. HCPCI's gross premiums earned in 2021 were $401,137,000 compared with $337,082,000 in 2020. TypTap's gross premiums earned in 2021 were $175,907,000 compared with $78,836,000 in 2020.
Premiums Ceded for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $199,741,000 and $153,458,000, respectively, representing 34.6% and 36.9%, respectively, of gross premiums earned. Our premiums ceded represent costs of reinsurance to cover losses from catastrophes that exceed the retention levels defined by our catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance contracts or to assume a proportional share of losses defined in a quota share arrangement. The rates we pay for reinsurance are based primarily on policy exposures reflected in gross premiums earned. The $46,283,000 increase was primarily attributable to increased reinsurance costs effective June 1, 2021 and a higher level of reinsurance coverage, offset by a reduction in premiums ceded attributable to retrospective provisions under multi-year reinsurance contracts. See “Economic Impact of Reinsurance Contracts with Retrospective Provisions” under “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.”
Net Premiums Written for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 totaled approximately $474,648,000 and $350,696,000, respectively. Net premiums written represent the premiums charged on policies issued during a fiscal period less any applicable reinsurance costs. The $123,952,000 increase in 2021 resulted primarily from an increase in gross premiums written from the growth of TypTap business of approximately $142,624,000 and the assumed business from United of approximately $128,948,000. HCPCI’s and TypTap’s gross premiums written were approximately $426,910,000 and $247,479,000, respectively, for 2021 compared with approximately $399,299,000 and $104,855,000, respectively, for 2020. We had approximately 180,700 policies in force at December 31, 2021 versus approximately 154,000 policies in force at December 31, 2020.
Net Premiums Earned for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $377,303,000 and $262,460,000, respectively, and reflect the gross premiums earned less reinsurance costs as described above.
The following is a reconciliation of our Net Premiums Written to Net Premiums Earned for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (amounts in thousands):
Net Investment Income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $12,335,000 and $4,564,000, respectively. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to an increase in income from limited partnership investments of approximately $6,542,000 and a net gain of $2,790,000 recognized in 2021 for a legal settlement received from The Kroger Co. See Note 5 -- “Investments” under Net Investment Income to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Net Realized Investment Gains for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $6,472,000 and $1,000,000, respectively. The gains in 2021 resulted primarily from sales of equity securities.
Net Unrealized Investment Gains for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $1,363,000 and $679,000, respectively. Net unrealized investment gains or losses represent the net change in the fair value of equity securities. The increase in 2021 reflected an overall improvement in the equity market compared with 2020.
Expenses
Our consolidated Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses amounted to approximately $227,525,000 and $160,036,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to losses associated with the assumption of policies from United, the organic growth in TypTap’s homeowners business, and the unfavorable loss development for the 2020 loss year. See “Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses” under “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.”
Policy Acquisition and Other Underwriting Expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $93,732,000 and $53,859,000, respectively, and primarily reflect the amortization of deferred acquisition costs such as commissions payable to agents for production and renewal of policies, and premium taxes. The increase was primarily attributable to amortization of increased costs associated with the policies assumed from United and the amortization of increased commission costs related to the growth of TypTap's policies in force during 2021.
Debt Conversion Expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was approximately $1,754,000, representing costs associated with certain of the conversions of our 4.25% convertible senior notes.
General and Administrative Personnel Expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $45,428,000 and $33,829,000, respectively. Our general and administrative personnel expenses include salaries, wages, payroll taxes, stock-based compensation expense, and employee benefit costs. Factors such as merit increases, changes in headcount, and periodic restricted stock grants, among others, cause fluctuations in this expense. In addition, our personnel expenses are decreased by the capitalization of payroll costs related to a project to develop software for internal use and the payroll costs associated with the processing and settlement of Hurricane Irma claims which are recoverable from reinsurers under reinsurance contracts. The year-over-year increase of $11,599,000 was primarily attributable to an $8,042,000 increase in salaries and wages expense due to an increase in the headcount of temporary and full-time employees and merit increases for non-executive employees, and a $5,621,000 increase in stock-based compensation expense, offset by a decrease in employee incentive bonus and higher capitalized and recoverable payroll costs.
Interest Expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $6,400,000 and $11,734,000, respectively. The decrease primarily resulted from conversions of our 4.25% convertible senior notes during the second half of 2021 and the early adoption of ASC 2020-06 “Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s own Equity.” As described in Note 2 -- “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, ASU 2020-06 allows the reversal of discounts previously recorded to account for the cash conversion feature of convertible debt instruments. Our 4.25% convertible senior notes contain such a cash conversion feature and accordingly the discount was reversed on January 1, 2021. As a result, interest expense no longer includes amounts representing the amortization of the discount.
Income Tax Expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was approximately $3,991,000 for federal, state, and foreign income taxes compared with income tax expense of approximately $9,348,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, resulting in an effective tax rate of 35.5% for 2021 and 25.3% for 2020. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the non-deductibility of certain executive compensation and the increase in deferred tax expense due to the increased Florida corporate tax rate effective January 1, 2022.
Ratios:
The loss ratio applicable to the year ended December 31, 2021 (losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred related to net premiums earned) was 60.3% compared with 61.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in net premiums earned.
The expense ratio applicable to the year ended December 31, 2021 (defined as total expenses excluding losses and loss adjustment expenses related to net premiums earned) was 44.8% compared with 43.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in our expense ratio was primarily attributable to the increase in policy acquisition, underwriting and personnel expenses, offset by the increase in net premiums earned and the decrease in interest expense.
The combined ratio is the measure of overall underwriting profitability before other income. Our combined ratio for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 105.1% compared with 104.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses combined with the increases in reinsurance costs and policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses.
Due to the impact our reinsurance costs have on net premiums earned from period to period, our management believes the combined ratio measured to gross premiums earned is more relevant in assessing overall performance. The combined ratio to gross premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 68.7% compared with 65.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The
increase in 2021 was primarily attributable to the increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses, offset by the increase in gross premiums earned.
Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2020 with the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflect net income of $27,580,000, or $3.49 diluted earnings per share, compared with a net income of $26,576,000, or $3.31 diluted earnings per share, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to a gain on involuntary conversion of $36,969,000 and a net increase in net premiums earned of $46,146,000, offset by an increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses of $52,522,000, a net decrease in income from our investment portfolio (consisting of net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains or losses) of $15,095,000, an increase in policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses of $11,362,000 and a $2,717,000 increase in payroll costs and other personnel expenses.
Revenue
Gross Premiums Earned for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $415,918,000 and $342,079,000, respectively. The increase in 2020 was primarily attributable to the policies transitioned from Anchor and increased policies in force from the growth in TypTap’s business, offset by a normal decrease due to policy attrition. Gross premiums earned related to the Anchor policies and the growth in TypTap’s business during 2020 were approximately $27,765,000 and $47,900,000, respectively.
Premiums Ceded for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $153,458,000 and $125,765,000, respectively, representing 36.9% and 36.8%, respectively, of gross premiums earned. The $27,693,000 increase was primarily attributable to increased reinsurance costs effective June 1, 2020 and a higher level of reinsurance coverage, offset by a reduction in premiums ceded attributable to retrospective provisions under one reinsurance contract. See “Economic Impact of Reinsurance Contracts with Retrospective Provisions” under “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.”
Net Premiums Written for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 totaled approximately $350,696,000 and $239,190,000, respectively. The increase in 2020 resulted primarily from an increase in gross premiums written from the growth of TypTap business of approximately $44,600,000, the transition of policies from Anchor of approximately $30,600,000, and the assumed business from United of approximately $44,600,000. HCPCI’s and TypTap’s gross premiums written were approximately $399,299,000 and $104,855,000, respectively, for 2020 compared with approximately $304,683,000 and $60,272,000, respectively, for 2019. We had approximately 154,000 policies in force at December 31, 2020 versus approximately 131,000 policies in force at December 31, 2019.
Net Premiums Earned for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $262,460,000 and $216,314,000, respectively, and reflect the gross premiums earned less reinsurance costs as described above.
The following is a reconciliation of our Net Premiums Written to Net Premiums Earned for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (amounts in thousands):
Net Investment Income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $4,564,000 and $13,642,000, respectively. The year-over-year decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in income from limited partnership investments of approximately $2,771,000 and lower interest income from fixed-maturity securities and cash balances by approximately $5,533,000. See Note 5 -- “Investments” under Net Investment Income to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Net Realized Investment Gains for the year ended December 31, 2020 were approximately $1,000,000 versus net realized investment losses of approximately $254,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The gains in 2020 resulted primarily from sales of fixed-maturity securities.
Net Unrealized Investment Gains for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $679,000 and $7,950,000, respectively. Net unrealized investment gains or losses represent the net change in the fair value of equity securities. In addition to an overall improvement in the equity market, we sold securities with unrealized gain positions during the first quarter of 2020. In contrast, securities with unrealized loss positions were sold during 2019.
Gain on Involuntary Conversion for the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $36,969,000. This one-time gain resulted from the transaction with the FDOT. See Note 9 -- “Property and Equipment, Net” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Expenses
Our Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses amounted to approximately $160,036,000 and $107,514,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The $52,522,000 increase was primarily attributable to $14,850,000 of losses from the addition of the Anchor policies, net losses after reinsurance recoverable for Hurricane Sally of $20,264,000 and $10,000,000 of losses specific to Tropical Storm Eta, offset by lower prior year development. See “Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses” under “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.”
Policy Acquisition and Other Underwriting Expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $53,859,000 and $42,497,000, respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to higher agent commission rates, property inspection costs associated with the organic growth of TypTap business, and $1,411,000 of amortized transition costs related to Anchor policies.
General and Administrative Personnel Expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $33,829,000 and $31,112,000, respectively. The year-over-year increase of $2,717,000 was primarily attributable to an increase in the headcount of temporary and full-time employees, merit increases for non-executive employees, higher stock-based compensation expense, and lower capitalized and recoverable payroll costs, offset by a decrease in employee incentive bonus.
Interest Expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $11,734,000 and $13,055,000, respectively. The decrease primarily resulted from the repayment of our 3.875% convertible senior notes in March 2019.
Income Tax Expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $9,348,000 for federal, state, and foreign income taxes compared with income tax expense of approximately $9,517,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting in an effective tax rate of 25.3% for 2020 and 26.4% for 2019.
Ratios:
The loss ratio applicable to the year ended December 31, 2020 was 61.0% compared with 49.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to a change in the mix of business and losses related to Hurricane Sally and Tropical Storm Eta.
The expense ratio applicable to the year ended December 31, 2020 was 43.2% compared with 45.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in our expense ratio was primarily attributable to the increase in net premiums earned, offset by the increases in policy acquisition expenses and general and administrative personnel expenses as described earlier.
The combined ratio to net premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 104.2% compared with 95.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses combined with the increases in reinsurance costs and policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses.
The combined ratio to gross premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 65.8% compared with 60.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in 2020 was primarily attributable to the increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses.
Seasonality of Our Business
Our insurance business is seasonal. Hurricanes and tropical storms affecting Florida, our primary market, and other southeastern states typically occur during the period from June 1st through November 30th of each year. Winter storms in the northeast usually occur during the period between December 1st and March 31st of each year. Also, with our reinsurance treaty year typically effective on June 1st of each year, any variation in the cost of our reinsurance, whether due to changes in reinsurance rates or changes in the total insured value of our policy base, will occur and be reflected in our financial results beginning on June 1st of each year.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Throughout our history, our liquidity requirements have been met through issuances of our common and preferred stock, debt offerings and funds from operations. We expect our future liquidity requirements will be met by funds from operations, primarily the cash received by insurance operations from premiums written and investment income. We may consider raising additional capital through debt and/or equity offerings to support our growth and future investment opportunities.
Our insurance operations require liquidity and adequate capital to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders and claimants and to fund operating expenses. In addition, we attempt to maintain adequate levels of liquidity and surplus to manage any differences between the duration of our liabilities and invested assets. In the insurance industry, cash collected for premiums from policies written is invested, interest and dividends are earned thereon, and losses and loss adjustment expenses are paid out over a period of years. This period of time varies by the circumstances surrounding each claim. Substantially all of our losses and loss adjustment expenses, excluding litigated claims, are fully settled and paid within approximately 100 days of the claim receipt date. Additional cash outflow occurs through payments of underwriting costs such as commissions, taxes, payroll, and general overhead expenses.
We believe that we maintain sufficient liquidity to pay claims and expenses, as well as to satisfy commitments in the event of unforeseen events such as reinsurer insolvencies, inadequate premium rates, or reserve deficiencies. We maintain a comprehensive reinsurance program at levels management considers adequate to diversify risk and safeguard our financial position.
In the future, we anticipate our primary use of funds will be to pay claims, reinsurance premiums, interest, and dividends and to fund operating expenses and real estate acquisitions.
Revolving Credit Facility, Convertible Senior Notes, Promissory Notes, and Finance Leases
The following table summarizes the principal and interest payment obligations for our indebtedness at December 31, 2021:
* At the option of the noteholders, we may be required to repurchase for cash all or any portion of the note on March 1, 2022, March 1, 2027 or March 1, 2032. See “Recent Developments” under Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
See Note 13 -- “Long-Term Debt” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Limited Partnership Investments
Our limited partnership investments consist of six private equity funds managed by their general partners. Four of these funds have unexpired capital commitments which are callable at the discretion of the fund’s general partner for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to provide additional capital for the two remaining funds with expired capital commitments. At December 31, 2021, there was an aggregate unfunded capital balance of $11,073,000. See Limited Partnership Investments under Note 5 -- “Investments” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Real Estate Investment
Real estate has long been a significant component of our overall investment portfolio. It helps offset the volatility of other high-risk assets. Thus, we may consider expanding our real estate investment portfolio should an opportunity arise.
We currently have a 90% equity interest in FMKT Mel JV, LLC, a Florida limited liability company for which we are not the primary beneficiary. FMKT Mel JV’s real estate portfolio consists of an outparcel for ground lease or sale. We have the option to take full ownership of this outparcel by acquiring the remaining 10% interest. Alternatively, we may sell this outparcel and allocate the profits from the sale before liquidating FMKT Mel JV.

Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $54,047,000, which consisted primarily of cash received from net premiums written and reinsurance recoveries of approximately $105,676,000 less cash disbursed for operating expenses, losses and loss adjustment expenses and interest payments. Net cash provided by investing activities of $50,459,000 was primarily due to the proceeds from sales of fixed-maturity and equity securities of $45,616,000, the proceeds from calls, repayments and maturities of fixed-maturity securities of $59,343,000, the proceeds from sales, redemptions and maturities of short-term and other investments of $67,398,000, and the distributions of $2,121,000 from limited partnership investments, offset by the purchases of fixed-maturity and equity securities of $107,299,000, the purchases of real estate investments of $11,481,000, the purchases of property and equipment of $2,887,000, the purchases of short-term and other investments of $1,178,000, and the investments in limited partnership interests of $1,174,000. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $114,724,000, which was primarily due to the repayment of long-term debt of $91,318,000, $20,054,000 used in our share repurchases, and $12,706,000 of net cash dividend payments, offset by $9,750,000 of borrowings from our revolving credit facility.
Investments
The main objective of our investment policy is to maximize our after-tax investment income with a reasonable level of risk given the current financial market. Our excess cash is invested primarily in money market accounts, certificates of deposit, and fixed-maturity and equity securities.
At December 31, 2021, we had $94,323,000 of fixed-maturity and equity investments, which are carried at fair value. Changes in the general interest rate environment affect the returns available on new fixed-maturity investments. While a rising interest rate environment enhances the returns available on new investments, it reduces the market value of existing fixed-maturity investments and thus the availability of gains on disposition. A decline in interest rates reduces the returns available on new fixed-maturity investments but increases the market value of existing fixed-maturity investments, creating the opportunity for realized investment gains on disposition. To maximize the gains from fixed-maturity investments in a low interest rate environment, we have decreased our holdings in fixed-maturity securities since the beginning of 2020.
In the future, we may alter our investment policy with regard to investments in federal, state and municipal obligations, preferred and common equity securities and real estate mortgages, as permitted by applicable law, including insurance regulations.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
As of December 31, 2021, we had unexpired capital commitments for limited partnerships in which we hold interests. Such commitments are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. See Note 24 -- “Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
We have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term are related to our losses and loss adjustment expenses, which include amounts estimated for claims incurred but not yet reported. We base our estimates on various assumptions and actuarial data we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.
We believe our accounting policies specific to losses and loss adjustment expenses, reinsurance recoverable, reinsurance with retrospective provisions, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, limited partnership investments, acquired intangible assets, warrants, and redeemable noncontrolling interest involve our most significant judgments and estimates material to our consolidated financial statements.
Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses. We establish reserves for the estimated total unpaid costs of losses including loss adjustment expenses (LAE). Loss and LAE reserves reflect management’s best estimate of the total cost of (i) claims that have been incurred, but not yet paid in full, and (ii) claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us (“IBNR”). Reserves established by us represent an estimate of the outcome of future events and, as such, cannot be considered an exact calculation of our liability. Rather, loss and LAE reserves represent management’s best estimate of our company’s liability based on the application of actuarial techniques and other projection methodologies and taking into consideration other facts and circumstances known at the balance sheet date. The process of establishing loss and LAE reserves is complex and inherently imprecise, as it involves the estimation of the outcome of future uncertain events. The impact of both internal and external variables on ultimate losses and LAE costs is difficult to estimate. In determining loss and LAE reserves, we give careful consideration to all available data and actuarial analyses.
Currently, our estimated ultimate liability is calculated using the principles and procedures described in Note 15 -- “Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are applied to the lines of business written. However, because the establishment of loss and LAE reserves is an inherently uncertain process, we cannot be certain that ultimate losses will not exceed the established loss and LAE reserves and have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in estimates, or differences between estimates and amounts ultimately paid, are reflected in the operating results of the period during which such adjustments are made.
Our reported results, financial position and liquidity would be affected by likely changes in key assumptions that determine our net loss reserves. Management does not believe that any reasonably likely changes in the frequency of claims would affect our loss and LAE reserves. However, management believes that a reasonably likely increase or decrease in the severity of claims could impact our net loss and LAE reserves. The table below summarizes the effect on net loss and LAE reserves and equity in the event of reasonably likely changes in the severity of claims considered in establishing loss and LAE reserves. The range of reasonably likely changes in the severity of our claims was established based on a review of changes in loss year development and applied to loss and LAE reserves as a whole. The selected range of changes does not indicate what could be the potential best or worst case or likely scenarios:
Reinsurance Recoverable. Our reinsurance recoverable balance represents an estimate of the amount of paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses that is recoverable from reinsurers. This estimate is determined in a manner consistent with the terms of the applicable reinsurance contracts and based on the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses we expect to incur. Given the uncertainty of the ultimate amounts of losses and loss adjustment expenses, the estimate may vary significantly from the eventual outcome.
Economic Impact of Reinsurance Contracts with Retrospective Provisions. Two of our reinsurance contracts include retrospective provisions that adjust premiums in the event losses are minimal or zero. As described earlier, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the estimation of future losses. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we will recognize an asset in the period in which the absence of loss experience obligates the reinsurer to pay cash or other consideration under the contract. In the event that a loss arises, we will derecognize such asset in the period in which a loss arises. Such adjustments to the asset, which accrue throughout the contract term, will negatively impact our operating results when a catastrophic loss event occurs during the contract term.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we accrued benefits of $10,864,000. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we accrued benefits of $15,120,000. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we accrued benefits of $6,344,000 and recognized a reduction in ceded premiums of $434,000. In combination, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized decreases in ceded premiums of $10,864,000 and $15,120,000, respectively.
As of December 31, 2021, we had $3,064,000 of accrued benefits, the amount that would be charged to earnings in the event we experience a catastrophic loss that exceeds the coverage limit provided under such agreements. In June 2021, we received a $18,720,000 premium refund under the retrospective reinsurance contract that ended May 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, we had $10,920,000 of accrued benefits, the amount that would be charged to earnings in the event we experience a catastrophic loss that exceeds the coverage limit provided under such agreement. In June 2020, we received a $13,680,000 premium refund under the retrospective reinsurance contract that ended May 31, 2020. We believe the credit risk associated with the collectability of these accrued benefits is minimal based on available information about the reinsurer’s financial position and the reinsurer’s demonstrated ability to comply with contract terms.
Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with U.S. GAAP, resulting in two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period by applying the provisions of the enacted tax law to the taxable income or excess of deductions over revenues. We determine deferred income taxes using the liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and enacted changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. Deferred tax assets, representing future reductions in taxable income, are recorded with the assumption that taxable income will be present in the future. Given the uncertainty regarding future taxable income, valuation allowances are provided against assets that are not likely to be realized, if any. We have elected to classify the related interest and penalties, if any, as income tax expense as permitted by current accounting standards.
Stock-Based Compensation. We account for stock-based compensation awards under our stockholder-approved incentive plans in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of U.S. GAAP, which require the measurement, and recognition of compensation for all stock-based awards made to employees, non-employee directors, and third-party award recipients including stock options, restricted stock and warrant issuances based on estimated fair values. For restricted stock with service-based vesting conditions, fair value is determined by the market price of the stock on the grant date. Compensation expense is then recognized ratably over the requisite or derived service period of the award. Restricted stock awards with market-based vesting conditions require the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist to estimate the fair value and derived service period of the award. We then recognize the compensation expense ratably over this derived service period. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment, including estimating stock price volatility or derived service periods. We develop our estimates based on historical data and market information. We primarily use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the following variables for input to calculate the fair value of each stock award on the option grant date: 1) expected volatility of our stock price, 2) the risk-free interest rate, 3) expected term of each award, 4) expected dividends, and 5) an expected forfeiture rate. For stock-based awards granted by non-public subsidiaries, we determine a fair value with the assistance of an independent valuation specialist who may use different valuation methods such as a Monte Carlo simulation model and a binomial distribution model. Inputs such as an estimated stock price of our private subsidiary and expected price volatility used in these valuation methods are derived mathematically from a data analysis of many public peer companies with similar characteristics.
Limited Partnership Investments. The valuation of our limited partnership investments is prepared by the general partner of each fund. We use net asset value (“NAV”) provided by the general partner to estimate our share of the fair value of these investments. However, the timing of the delivery of the fund’s financial statements and NAV information is on a three-month lag which results in a three-month delay in the recognition of our share of the limited partnership’s earnings or losses. But because this is the best information
available, we use it as an estimate for the fair value at our reporting dates, unless conditions have changed significantly in the economy or securities markets since the previous quarter due to an event such as the onset of COVID-19. In such case, we will adjust our estimate with the assistance from the general partner.
Acquired Intangible Assets. Acquired intangible assets represent the fair value of consideration we paid and are estimated to pay in exchange for the renewal rights and non-compete intangible assets acquired from the seller. In the renewal rights transaction, we purchased the right, but not the obligation, to offer homeowners insurance coverage to all current policyholders of the seller in certain states on the agreed-upon policy replacement date. The renewal rights agreement also contains a non-compete clause whereby the seller agrees not to offer homeowners insurance policies in these states through a specified date. We record intangible assets based on the fair value of the consideration we paid and are estimated to pay to the seller as provided in the renewal rights agreement with the seller. We engaged a third-party valuation specialist to assist with the allocation of the renewal rights and non-compete intangible assets acquired. Uncertainty is inherent in the estimates of future payments and in the assumptions made in allocating value to separate intangible assets. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets are evaluated periodically to ensure that there is no impairment to carrying value and no change required in the amortization period.
Warrants and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest. In the capital investment transaction completed by TTIG with a fund associated with Centerbridge Partners, L.P., TTIG issued 10,000,000 total shares of Series A Preferred Stock and HCI issued warrants to purchase 750,000 shares of HCI common stock, in exchange for proceeds of $100,000,000. Both the fair value and expected term of the warrants were estimated with assistance from a third-party valuation specialist using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Total proceeds from the capital investment transaction were allocated using the residual fair value method, first to the warrants issued based on their estimated fair value, with the residual proceeds being allocated to the fair value of Series A Preferred Stock. See Note 20 -- “Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
