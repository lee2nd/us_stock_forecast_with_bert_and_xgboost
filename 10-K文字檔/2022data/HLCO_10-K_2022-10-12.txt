Overview of Current Operations
Results of Operations for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021
Revenue
The Company did not report any revenues during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.
Operating Loss
Fiscal Years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021
The following table summarizes key items of comparison and their related changes for the years ended June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2021:
The Company reported an operating loss of $8,261,868 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, as compared to an operating loss for the period ended June 30, 2021, of $113,347. The substantial increase to our current year loss is a direct result of an increase in operational expenses of $8,148,522, consisting of increases to general and administrative expenses of $6,944,637, including $5,328,228 in stock based compensation expenses related to the issuance of certain stock awards and stock options, increases to professional and consulting fees of $480,725, as well as, $138,366 related to the impairment of certain intangible assets acquired during the current year and $584,794 in management fees. These increased costs were a result of the Company’s decision to change its business direction and move to retain additional management and operational staff as well as legal and accounting staff to support its planned growth in the health and wellness sector.
The Company also reported interest expenses of $2,331 in the current fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, with no comparative expense in the prior year, for total net losses of $8,264,200 and $113,347 in the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 respectively.

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, financing activities provided cash of $46,210 from advances by related parties.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our balance sheet as of June 30, 2022, reflects current assets of $6,577,475, consisting of $6,491,937 cash on hand and prepaid expenses of $85,538. We have working capital of $6,107,031 (June 30, 2021 - working capital deficit of $282,725) and have reported accumulated losses to date of $8,590,925. During the year ended June 30, 2022, we completed private placement subscription agreements to raise a total of $10 million by sale of seed preferred stock at $2 per share, from which the Company has collected $9,320,000, with the remaining $680,000 expected to be collected by December 31, 2022. The Company has commenced limited revenue generating operations and is conducting due diligence procedures on various potential acquisition targets, with the first transaction expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Subsequent to the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company has entered into a credit agreement with certain lenders who agreed to extend a credit facility to the Company consisting of up to $75,000,000 (which amount may be increased up to $150,000,000 in accordance with the terms of the Agreement) in aggregate principal amount of term loan commitments, the proceeds of which may be used to acquire assets that are deemed eligible by meeting certain criteria. Management believes the Company will have sufficient funds to continue operations through commencement of profitable operations.
The Company had been a “shell” company with no operations until the quarter ended September 30, 2021, when management determined to pursue business opportunities in the health and wellness sector and commenced operations by retaining qualified additional management to assist in identifying potential acquisitions. The Company exited shell status with the acquisition of NOEO on March 10, 2022. The Company is currently in the start-up phase and has generated minimal revenues from operations to date. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to identify and acquire revenue generating operations to fulfil the planned business objectives. In January 2021, the Company underwent a change in control with the sale of the majority shareholdings by our then current CEO and the resignation and appointment of the then sole officer and director. With the change in control, management and the Company’s majority shareholder determined to enter into the health and wellness sector and commenced the search for qualified officers, directors and management to guide the proposed growth of the Company. Operating capital was advanced by related party and third-party stockholders for operations which allowed the Company to effect certain changes to its authorized capital effecting a forward split of the then issued and outstanding shares of the Company and designating a series of Seed Preferred Stock. Thereafter the Company has raised proceeds through the sale of common stock and seed preferred stock. As of June 30 2022, the Company was fully subscribed under the Seed Preferred offering and had received subscription funds totaling $9,320,000.
During the period covered by this report the Company entered into various consulting and employment agreements with management, consultants, advisory board members and members of our Board. In January 2022 our then CEO, President and Director, Lee Larson Elmore resigned those positions and continued to serve as Secretary and Treasurer of the Company through June 6, 2022, Mr. Simon Belsham was appointed as CEO, President and Director in January 2022. Further the Company appointed three new members to the Board in January 2022, and in March 2022 appointed a further director and Chairman of the Board. We also added Mr. Amit Kapur to the executive team as Chief Financial Officer in June 2022. All of the new appointees have experience that will assist the Company in achieving its proposed business objectives. The issuance of additional securities may result in significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. During March 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of its first operating entity, NOEO, for cash consideration of EUR25,000. The Company is currently reviewing a number of additional business acquisitions and expects to enter into further acquisition agreements prior to the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in concluding any proposed acquisitions.
COVID-19 Pandemic
While it appears the COVID-19 pandemic is subsiding, the impact of COVID-19 could continue to have an adverse impact on the Company going forward. COVID-19 has caused significant disruptions to the global financial markets, which may severely impact the Company’s ability to raise additional capital and to pursue certain acquisitions. The full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve as of the date of this report and is highly uncertain and subject to change. The Company is not able to estimate the potential effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on its operations or financial condition for the next 12 months. There are no assurances that the Company will be able to meet its obligations, raise funds or conclude the acquisition of identified businesses.
Going Concern
The Company has working capital of approximately $6 million at June 30, 2022. During the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company entered into private placement subscription agreements to raise a total of $10 million by sale of seed preferred stock at $2 per share, of which the Company has collected $9,320,000, with the remaining $680,000 expected to be collected in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The Company has commenced limited operations and is conducting due diligence procedures on various potential acquisition targets. Subsequent to the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company has entered into a credit agreement with certain lenders who agreed to extend a credit facility to the Company consisting of up to $75,000,000 (which amount may be increased up to $150,000,000 in accordance with the terms of the Agreement) in aggregate principal amount of term loan commitments, the proceeds of which may be used to acquire assets that are deemed eligible by meeting certain criteria. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the ability to attain profitable operations from the Company's future planned business operations and sufficient financing to carry out those plans. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital as needed, or conduct revenue generating operations, the Company may be required to reduce the scope, delay, or eliminate some or all of its planned operations. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence.
Plan of Operation
The Company changed the focus of its business during fiscal 2021 and the Company intends to build a community of integrated healing brands by identifying and acquiring early stage, high potential brands within selected wellness categories. Our plan is to build individual market impact through enhanced branding, a credible narrative, social conversation and improved accessibility by positioning. Our first acquisition was of NOEO, a company involved in direct-to-consumer brand focusing on adaptogenic herbs and we are currently negotiating on a number of further acquisitions. The Company funded operations by the sale of equity and has arranged a $75,000,000 credit facility to enable it to fund potential acquisitions as they are identified.
To date we have identified two key acquisition targets, both of which are expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, although there can be no assurances that these planned acquisitions will close within this time frame, if at all.
We are in the final stage of concluding the acquisition of Los Angeles based Your Super, Inc. in order to capitalize on two high-growth wellness sectors: superfoods and plant-based nutrition. Your Super ranked #1 in the food and beverage category on Inc.’s 2021 5,000 fastest growing company list, placing 25th overall with a three-year revenue growth of 11,477 percent and $180 million in cumulative revenue. Your Super is a next-gen industry leader in plant-based living. Your Super's plant-based superfood and protein mixes contain 5-6 naturally dried superfoods. Superfoods are nutrient-rich foods considered to be high in micronutrients like vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, phytonutrients and enzymes, beneficial for health and well-being. Every ingredient is grown, harvested, 3rd party tested, and packaged 100% sustainably. The ingredients are certified organic, non-GMO certified, glyphosate-free, plant-based and gluten-free. Your Super products do not contain any sweeteners, stevia, artificial flavors, fillers, preservatives or additives.
The Company has entered into negotiations to acquire a health supplements company that is on a mission to significantly improve the lives of everyone it reaches. With focus on nutritional balance, transparency of ingredients, and optimizing of quality and efficacy, this strategic purchase, upon completion, will allow the Company to expand its capabilities across both current and future brands. This target acquisition reported approximately $10 million in gross revenue last year, with strong profitability. The Company also expects, although it cannot guarantee, to conclude this transaction during the second quarter of fiscal 2023.
While the Company has to date been successful in raising funds by way of the sale of equity and establishing a credit facility, the Company's need for ongoing capital by way of loans, sale of equity and/or convertible notes may continue until we can establish substantive revenues from operations to cover all operational overhead. There are no assurances additional capital will be available to the Company on acceptable terms or that this equity line will be available to us when needed.
Future funding could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. Any future funding might require the Company to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which might not be available on terms favorable to the Company, or at all, and such financing, if available, might be dilutive.
Contractual Obligations
As a "smaller reporting company", the Company is not required to provide tabular disclosure obligations.
Inflation
Inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our business and we do not expect that inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business in the foreseeable future. However, our management will closely monitor the price change in travel industry and continually maintain effective cost control in operations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.
Seasonality
Our operating results and operating cash flows historically have not been subject to seasonal variations. This pattern may change, however, as a result of new market opportunities or new product introduction.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of their evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances. Our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in the Notes to our Financial Statements.
REVENUE RECOGNITION - The Company follows ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the core principle of which is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, five basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company considers its performance obligations satisfied upon shipment and/or delivery of the purchased products to the customer. The Company evaluates returns from customers purchasing product using its eCommerce site on a case-by-case basis and generally will issue replacement product in the limited cases of product returns. The Company has no policy requiring cash refunds. The Company did not record any revenue during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06 to simplify the current guidance for convertible instruments and the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity. Additionally, the amendments affect the diluted EPS calculation for instruments that may be settled in cash or shares and for convertible instruments. The update also provides for expanded disclosure requirements to increase transparency. For SEC filers, excluding smaller reporting companies, this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, this Update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods therein.
