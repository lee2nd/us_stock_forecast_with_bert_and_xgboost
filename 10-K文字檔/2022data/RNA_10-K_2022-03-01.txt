ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based upon our current beliefs, plans and expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” or in other parts of this annual report.
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company committed to delivering a new class of RNA therapeutics called Antibody Oligonucleotide Conjugates, or AOCs. Our proprietary AOC platform is designed to combine the specificity of monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, with the precision of RNA therapeutics to target the root cause of diseases previously untreatable with such therapeutics. We are initially focused on muscle diseases to demonstrate the capabilities of our AOCs, and we expect to have three muscle programs in clinical development by the end of 2022. Our lead product candidate, AOC 1001, is designed to treat myotonic dystrophy type 1, or DM1, a rare monogenic muscle disease. In October 2021, we dosed the first patient in our Phase 1/2 MARINA clinical trial, a trial designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple ascending doses of AOC 1001 administered intravenously in adults with DM1. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we plan to conduct a preliminary assessment of safety, tolerability and key biomarkers in approximately half of the trial participants. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and European Medicines Agency, or EMA, have granted Orphan Designation for AOC 1001. The FDA has also granted Fast Track Designation to AOC 1001 for the treatment of DM1.
Our advancing and expanding pipeline also includes AOC 1044, the lead of three programs for the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, or DMD, and AOC 1020, designed to treat facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, or FSHD. We anticipate that both AOC 1044 and AOC 1020 will enter the clinic by the end of 2022 following additional preparatory preclinical studies and regulatory clearance. In addition to our muscle franchise, we are also broadening the development of AOCs beyond muscle tissues through both internal discovery efforts and key partnerships that are focused on immune cells, cardiac tissue and other cell types.
Since our inception in 2012, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, developing our proprietary AOC platform, identifying potential product candidates, establishing our intellectual property portfolio, conducting research, preclinical and clinical studies, and providing other general and administrative support for these operations. We have not generated any revenue from product sales. In June 2020, we completed our initial public offering, or IPO, of 16,560,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $18.00 per share, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 2,160,000 additional shares of our common stock. Including the option exercise, our aggregate net proceeds from the offering were $274.1 million, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and offering costs. In August 2021, we completed a public offering of 9,200,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $18.00 per share, for aggregate net proceeds of $155.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering costs. In July 2021, we entered into a sales agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with Cowen and Company, LLC, or the Sales Agent, under which we may, from time to time, sell shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $150.0 million through the Sales Agent. To date, we have sold 780,549 shares of our common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement and received net proceeds of $19.6 million, after deducting offering-related transaction costs and commissions. Since our inception through December 31, 2021, other sources of capital raised to fund our operations were comprised of aggregate gross proceeds of $131.6 million from the sale and issuance of convertible preferred stock/units and convertible notes, $35.2 million from funding under collaboration and research services agreements, and $7.0 million from loans from Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, under a Loan and Security Agreement, as amended, or the LSA. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $405.5 million.
We have incurred operating losses in each year since inception. Our net losses were $118.0 million, $44.4 million and $24.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $184.5 million. We expect our expenses and operating losses will increase substantially as we conduct our ongoing and planned preclinical studies and clinical trials, continue our research and development activities, utilize third parties to manufacture our product candidates and related raw materials, hire additional personnel, protect our intellectual property and incur additional costs associated with being a public company. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our preclinical studies and clinical trials and our expenditures on other research and development activities, as well as the generation of any collaboration and services revenue.
Based upon our current operating plans, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least 12 months from the date of the filing of this Form 10-K. While we may generate revenue under our current and/or future collaboration agreements, we do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates, which we expect will take a number of years and may never occur. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Accordingly, until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our product candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed, on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
COVID-19
The COVID-19 outbreak in the United States has caused significant business disruption. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the continued spread of COVID-19 and the measures taken by the governmental authorities, and its impact on our preclinical studies and clinical trials, employees and vendors, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted, particularly as we advance our product candidates into and through clinical development. In December 2021, we began to transition to a hybrid model with our employees generally working both remotely and onsite, and we anticipate we will continue to use this model going forward. To date, we have not experienced material disruptions in our business operations. However, a prolonged outbreak could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and business operations, including the timing of and our ability to complete certain clinical trials and other efforts required to advance the development of our product candidates and raise additional capital.
Agreement and Plan of Conversion
In April 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Conversion, pursuant to which we converted from Avidity Biosciences LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, or Avidity LLC, into Avidity Biosciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation. All of the membership interests of Avidity LLC were converted into securities of Avidity Biosciences, Inc., as follows: (i) each outstanding common unit of Avidity LLC converted into one share of Avidity Biosciences, Inc.’s common stock; (ii) each outstanding Series A convertible preferred unit of Avidity LLC converted into one share of Avidity Biosciences, Inc.’s Series A convertible preferred stock; and (iii) each outstanding Series B convertible preferred unit of Avidity LLC converted into one share of Avidity Biosciences, Inc.’s Series B convertible preferred stock. Outstanding convertible notes, warrants and stock awards under Avidity LLC’s employee benefit and incentive compensation plans continued on the same terms and conditions and became binding upon Avidity Biosciences, Inc.
Research Collaboration and License Agreement with Eli Lilly and Company
In April 2019, we entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Lilly Agreement, with Eli Lilly and Company, or Lilly, for the discovery, development and commercialization of AOC products in immunology and other select indications on a worldwide basis. Under the Lilly Agreement, we and Lilly will collaborate on preclinical research and discovery activities for such products, with Lilly being responsible for funding the cost of such activities by both parties. Lilly will also lead the clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization of all such products, at its sole cost. We granted Lilly an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to sublicense, under our technology to research, develop, manufacture, and sell products containing AOCs that are directed to up to six mRNA targets. We retain the right to use our technology to perform our obligations under the agreement and for all purposes not granted to Lilly. Lilly paid us an upfront license fee of $20.0 million in 2019, and we are eligible to receive up to $60.0 million in development milestone payments, up to $140.0 million in regulatory milestone payments and up to $205.0 million in commercialization milestone payments per target. We are eligible to receive a tiered royalty ranging from the mid-single to low-double digits from Lilly on worldwide annual net sales of licensed products, subject to specified and capped reductions for the market entry of biosimilar products, loss of patent coverage of licensed products and for payments owed to third parties for additional rights necessary to commercialize licensed products in the territory.
Concurrently with the Lilly Agreement, we issued a convertible promissory note to Lilly, or the Lilly Note, and received cash proceeds of $15.0 million in 2019. The Lilly Note accrued simple interest of 8.0% per annum and, if not converted, would have matured in October 2020. In connection with the sale of our Series C convertible preferred stock in November 2019, all outstanding principal and interest accrued under the Lilly Note converted into 4,576,342 shares of our Series C convertible preferred stock, at a conversion price equal to 80% of the per share cash price paid by the investors in the Series C convertible preferred stock financing. In connection with our IPO in June 2020, the Series C convertible preferred stock related to the Lilly Note converted into 2,169,396 shares of our common stock.
Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
Our revenue to date has been derived from payments received under the Lilly Agreement and other license and research agreements. For the foreseeable future, we may generate revenue from reimbursements of services under the Lilly Agreement, as well as a combination of upfront payments and milestone payments under our current and/or future collaboration agreements. We do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products unless and until such time that our product candidates have advanced through clinical development and regulatory approval, if ever. We expect that any revenue we generate, if at all, will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter as a result of the timing and amount of payments relating to such services and milestones and the extent to which any of our products are approved and successfully commercialized. If we fail to complete preclinical and clinical development of product candidates or obtain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate future revenues and our results of operations and financial position would be adversely affected.
Operating Expenses
Research and Development
Research and development expenses consist of external and internal costs associated with our research and development activities, including our discovery and research efforts, and the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. Our research and development expenses include:
•
external costs, including expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as contract research organizations, contract manufacturers, consultants and our scientific advisors; and
•
internal costs, including;
•
employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation;
•
the costs of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical study materials; and
•
facilities, information technology and depreciation, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment.
Research and development costs, including costs reimbursed under the Lilly Agreement, are expensed as incurred, with reimbursements of such amounts being recognized as revenue. We account for nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities as expenses when the service has been performed or when the goods have been received.
At any one time, we are working on multiple programs. Our internal resources, employees and infrastructure are not directly tied to any one research or drug discovery program and are typically deployed across multiple programs. As such, we do not track internal costs on a specific program basis. The following table summarizes our external costs and internal costs for the periods presented (in thousands):
We expect our research and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to conduct our ongoing research and development activities, advance our preclinical research programs toward clinical development, including conducting IND-enabling studies, and conduct clinical trials. The process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. We may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for any of our product candidates.
The timelines and costs associated with research and development activities are uncertain, can vary significantly for each product candidate and development program, and are difficult to predict. We anticipate we will make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to preclinical and clinical results, regulatory developments, ongoing assessments as to each program’s commercial potential, and our ability to maintain or enter into new collaborations, to the extent we determine the resources or expertise of a collaborator would be beneficial for a given program. We will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future. In addition, we cannot forecast which development programs may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements.
Our development costs may vary significantly based on factors such as:
•
the number and scope of clinical, preclinical and IND-enabling studies;
•
per patient trial costs;
•
the number of trials required for approval;
•
the number of sites included in the trials;
•
the countries in which the trials are conducted;
•
the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;
•
the number of patients that participate in the trials;
•
the number of doses that patients receive;
•
the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;
•
potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies;
•
the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up;
•
the cost and timing of manufacturing our product candidates;
•
the phase of development of our product candidates; and
•
the efficacy and safety profile of our product candidates.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for employees in our executive, finance, accounting, legal, business development and support functions. Other general and administrative expenses include allocated facility, information technology and depreciation related costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses and professional fees for auditing, tax, intellectual property and legal services. Costs related to filing and pursuing patent applications are recognized as general and administrative expenses as incurred since recoverability of such expenditures is uncertain.
We expect our general and administrative expenses will increase for the foreseeable future to support our increased research and development activities and costs of operating as a public company. These costs will likely include increased expenses related to audit, legal, regulatory and tax services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance premiums and investor relations costs associated with operating as a public company.
Other Income (Expense)
Interest Income
Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists of cash and noncash interest expense associated with our previously outstanding financing arrangements, which included borrowings under the LSA and convertible notes with certain of our investors.
Change in Fair Value of Preferred Warrant Liability
Prior to our IPO, we classified our outstanding warrant to purchase shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock as a liability on our balance sheets at its estimated fair value since the underlying convertible preferred stock was classified as temporary equity. At the end of each reporting period, changes in the estimated fair value during the period were recorded as a component of other income (expense). In connection with our IPO, this warrant was adjusted to become a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock and met the criteria to be classified within stockholders’ equity; therefore, the warrant was no longer subject to liability accounting. Accordingly, the fair value of the warrant liability was reclassified to stockholders’ equity.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):
Revenue
Revenue was $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenue during both periods was primarily derived from the Lilly Agreement. The increase was primarily due to higher reimbursable collaboration-related research and development expenses resulting in the recognition of higher corresponding revenue under the Lilly Agreement.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses were $101.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher external and internal research and development costs related to the advancement of AOC 1001, AOC 1044 and AOC 1020, as well as costs related to the expansion of our overall research capabilities. In 2021, external research and development costs were $59.0 million, compared to $22.9 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher manufacturing, clinical, preclinical and research activities. Research and development related internal costs were $42.2 million in 2021, compared to $14.7 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher employee salaries and benefits of $14.7 million, noncash stock compensation of $7.3 million, lab supplies of $3.0 million and facilities of $1.7 million.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $26.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher costs related to supporting our expanded operations and being a public company, including higher noncash stock-based compensation of $5.4 million, salaries and benefits of $4.1 million, professional fees of $1.6 million, insurance costs of $0.9 million and facilities costs of $0.6 million.
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
Revenue
Revenue was $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Revenue during both periods was derived from the Lilly Agreement, which was entered into in April 2019. The increase was due to higher reimbursable collaboration-related research and development expenses resulting in the recognition of higher corresponding revenue under the Lilly Agreement.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses were $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by higher external and internal research and development costs related to the advancement of AOC 1001 and our other programs, as well as costs related to the expansion of our overall research capabilities. In 2020, external research and development costs were $22.9 million, compared to $6.6 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher research and preclinical activities, including manufacturing activities. Research and development related internal costs were $14.7 million in 2020, compared to $7.9 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher employee salaries and benefits of $2.9 million, noncash stock compensation of $1.8 million, lab supplies of $1.1 million and facilities of $0.5 million.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher costs related to being a public company, including higher salaries and benefits of $2.1 million, noncash stock-based compensation of $2.1 million, professional fees of $1.8 million and insurance costs of $1.0 million, as well as higher patent filing fees of $0.8 million.
Other Income (Expense)
Other expense was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was primarily related to reduced interest expense as a result of the November 2019 conversion of all outstanding convertible notes into convertible preferred stock, which was subsequently converted into common stock in connection with our IPO.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
In June 2020, we completed our IPO of 16,560,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $18.00 per share, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 2,160,000 additional shares of our common stock. Including the option exercise, our aggregate net proceeds from the offering were $274.1 million, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and offering costs. In August 2021, we completed a public offering of 9,200,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $18.00 per share, for aggregate net proceeds of $155.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering costs. In July 2021, we entered into the Sales Agreement with the Sales Agent, under which we may, from time to time, sell shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $150.0 million through the Sales Agent. To date, we have sold 780,549 shares of our common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement and received net proceeds of $19.6 million, after deducting offering-related transaction costs and commissions. Since our inception through December 31, 2021, other sources of capital raised to fund our operations were comprised of aggregate gross proceeds of $131.6 million from the sale and issuance of convertible preferred stock/units and convertible notes, $35.2 million from funding under collaboration and research services agreements, and $7.0 million from loans from SVB under the LSA. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $405.5 million.
Convertible Promissory Notes
In July 2018 and February 2019, we issued convertible promissory notes to certain of our existing investors, or the 2018 Notes and 2019 Notes, respectively, and received proceeds of $3.0 million and $4.5 million, respectively. The 2018 Notes and 2019 Notes accrued simple interest at a rate of 8% and 10% per annum, respectively, and had a maturity date in December 2020, subject to earlier conversion.
In addition, in April 2019, as described above, in connection with the Lilly Agreement, we issued the Lilly Note and received cash proceeds of $15.0 million.
In November 2019, in connection with our Series C financing transaction, all outstanding amounts of principal and accrued interest from the 2018 Notes, 2019 Notes and Lilly Note, which totaled $23.8 million, were converted into an aggregate of 6,893,036 shares of our Series C convertible preferred stock, which subsequently converted into shares of our common stock in connection with our IPO.
SVB Loan and Security Agreement
In June 2017, we entered into an amendment to the LSA with SVB, or the First LSA Amendment, which provided up to $7.0 million in available borrowings in two tranches. In 2017, we drew the first tranche of $5.0 million, of which $4.6 million was used to repay our existing debt obligations to SVB. In August 2018, we drew the second tranche of $2.0 million. Interest accrued on the unpaid principal balance at an adjustable annual rate of the prime rate per the Wall Street Journal plus 0.20%. In addition to our monthly payments of principal and interest, our repayment obligations included a final payment of 6.5% of the original principal advanced, which was due upon final maturity of the loan in June 2021. On June 30, 2020, we voluntarily prepaid the outstanding principal balance of $2.8 million and final payments and accrued interest of $0.5 million under the LSA, and the LSA was terminated.
In connection with execution of the LSA, we issued SVB a warrant to purchase 16,474 shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of $2.2615 per share, exercisable at any time following issuance with a term of ten years. In connection with the completion of our IPO in June 2020, the preferred stock warrant was adjusted to become a warrant exercisable for 7,809 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $4.77 per share. In connection with the First LSA Amendment in June 2017, we issued SVB an additional warrant to purchase 9,442 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.53 per share, exercisable at any time following issuance with a term of seven years. On June 17, 2020, the warrants were cashless exercised for an aggregate of 15,833 shares of common stock.
Future Capital Requirements
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $405.5 million. Based upon our current operating plans, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least 12 months from the date of the filing of this Form 10-K. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could deplete our capital resources sooner than we expect. Additionally, the process of conducting preclinical studies and testing product candidates in clinical trials is costly, and the timing of progress and expenses in these studies and trials is uncertain.
Our future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:
•
the type, number, scope, progress, expansions, results, costs and timing of discovery, preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates that we are pursuing or may choose to pursue in the future;
•
the costs and timing of manufacturing for our product candidates and commercial manufacturing if any product candidate is approved;
•
the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;
•
the terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements;
•
the costs of obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our patents and other intellectual property rights;
•
our efforts to enhance operational systems and hire additional personnel to satisfy our obligations as a public company, including enhanced internal controls over financial reporting;
•
the costs associated with hiring additional personnel and consultants as our preclinical and clinical activities increase;
•
the timing and amount of the milestone or other payments made to us under the Lilly Agreement or any future collaboration agreements;
•
the costs and timing of establishing or securing sales and marketing capabilities if any product candidate is approved;
•
our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share and revenue for any approved products; and
•
costs associated with any products or technologies that we may in-license or acquire.
While we may generate revenue under our current and/or future collaboration agreements, we do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates, which we expect will take a number of years and may never occur. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Accordingly, until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our product candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including current and potential future collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed, on favorable terms or at all. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $94.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which consisted primarily of cash used to fund our operations related to the development of AOC 1001, AOC 1044 and AOC 1020. Net cash used in operating activities was $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which consisted primarily of cash used to fund our operations related to the development of AOC
1001 and our other programs. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which consisted primarily of the $20.0 million upfront fee related to the Lilly Agreement, partially offset by cash used to fund our operations related to the development of AOC 1001 and our other programs.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $82.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which consisted primarily of cash used to purchase marketable securities and property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities. Net cash used in investing activities was $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which consisted primarily of cash used to purchase marketable securities and property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which consisted primarily of cash used to purchase property and equipment.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $176.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in our August 2021 public offering and sales of our common stock made pursuant to the Sales Agreement, as well as proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under the ESPP. Net cash provided by financing activities was $272.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which consisted primarily of net proceeds from our IPO and net proceeds from the issuance of Series C convertible preferred stock, partially offset by payments related to the LSA. Net cash provided by financing activities was $89.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of Series C convertible preferred stock and the issuance of convertible notes, partially offset by payments related to the LSA.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We have operating lease obligations related to our lease for office and laboratory space in San Diego, California. In June 2020, and as amended in December 2020, we entered into a non-cancellable operating lease for approximately 47,737 square feet of office and laboratory space, or the Lease, which commenced in November 2021. The Lease has a five-year initial term with a renewal option for an additional five years. Under the terms of the Lease, the initial monthly base rent of approximately $251,000 will increase to approximately $282,000 during the last year of the Lease's initial term, and the first year includes five months of rent abatement. The total remaining base rent commitment for the initial term under the Lease is $14.5 million.
We enter into contracts in the normal course of business for contract research services, contract manufacturing services, clinical trials, professional services, and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts may include certain provisions that could require payments for early termination. The amount of the termination payments vary depending on the timing of the termination and the specific terms of the contract. Therefore, these contracts are considered cancellable contracts.
Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities and the recording of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our historical and future performance.
Revenue Recognition
To date, all of our revenue has been derived from our collaboration and research agreements entered into with Lilly and various other parties. The terms of these arrangements include payments to us for the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments; payments for research and development services provided by us or for manufacturing supply services we may provide through our contract manufacturers; and royalties on net sales of licensed products.
Effective January 1, 2019, we began recognizing revenue in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The adoption of ASC 606 using the modified retrospective approach did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as we did not have any revenue-generating arrangements in effect at January 1, 2019. In accordance with ASC 606, we perform the following five steps in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as we fulfill our obligations under each of these agreements: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including any constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy each performance obligation.
If an agreement includes a license to our intellectual property and that license is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenues allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.
With respect to our assessment of the Lilly Agreement, we identified multiple promises to deliver goods and services, which include at inception of the agreement: (i) a license to technology and patents, information and know-how; and (ii) collaboration, including research services, technical and regulatory support provided by us. We have identified one performance obligation for all the deliverables under the Lilly Agreement since the delivered elements are either not capable of being distinct or are not distinct within the context of the contract. Accordingly, we will recognize revenue for the fixed or determinable collaboration in an amount proportional to the collaboration expenses incurred and the total estimated collaboration expenses over the five-year period over which we expect to deliver our performance obligations. We periodically review and update the estimated collaboration expenses, when appropriate, which adjusts the percentage of revenue that is recognized for the period. While such changes to our estimates have no impact on our reported cash flows, the amount of revenue recorded in the period could be materially impacted.
For all periods presented, amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria were recorded as deferred revenue until all applicable revenue recognition criteria were met. Deferred revenue represented the portion of payments received that have not been earned.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation expense for employee and non-employee stock option grants is recorded at the estimated fair value of the award as of the grant date and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period (usually the vesting period) of the stock-based award, and forfeitures are recognized as incurred. Stock-based compensation expense for employee stock purchases under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the ESPP, is recorded at the estimated fair value of the purchase as of the plan enrollment date and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the applicable six-month ESPP offering period.
We estimate the fair value of our stock-based awards using the Black-Scholes model. The Black-Scholes model requires the use of subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected term and expected dividend yield. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value and ultimately how much stock-based compensation expense is recognized. These inputs are subjective and generally require judgment to develop.
Fair Value of our Common Stock. Prior to our IPO in June 2020, the fair value of the common stock underlying our equity awards was determined on each grant date by our board of directors, taking into account input from management and independent third-party valuation analyses. Following the completion of our IPO, the fair value of our common stock is based on the closing price as reported on the date of grant on the Nasdaq Global Market.
Risk-Free Interest Rate. We base the risk-free interest rate assumption for equity awards on the rates for U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued.
Expected Volatility. Due to the limited trading history of our common stock, the expected volatility assumption is based on volatilities of a peer group of similar companies whose share prices are publicly available. The peer group was developed based on companies in the biotechnology industry. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available.
Expected Term. Due to our limited option exercise history not providing a reasonable basis for estimating expected term, we have estimated the expected life of our stock options using the simplified method, whereby the expected life equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The expected life assumption for employee stock purchases under the ESPP is six months to conform with the six-month ESPP offering period.
Expected Dividend Yield. Our expected dividend yield assumption is zero as we have never paid dividends and have no present intention to do so in the future.
Accrued Research and Development Costs
As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to make estimates of our accrued research and development expenses resulting from our obligations under contracts with CROs, manufacturers, vendors and consultants. The financial terms of these contracts vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided under such contracts. We reflect research and development expenses in our financial statements by matching those expenses with the period in which services and efforts are expended. In accruing for these activities, we obtain information from various sources and estimate the level of effort or expense allocated to each period.
Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in our reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular
period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.
