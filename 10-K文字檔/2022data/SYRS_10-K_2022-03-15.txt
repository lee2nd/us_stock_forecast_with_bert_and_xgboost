ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis and set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the section titled “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company seeking to redefine the power of small molecules to control the expression of genes. Based on our unique ability to elucidate regulatory regions of the genome, we aim to develop medicines that provide a profound benefit for patients with diseases that have eluded other genomics-based approaches. We are currently focused on developing treatments for cancer and diseases resulting from mutations of a single gene, also known as monogenic diseases, and building a clinical stage pipeline of gene control medicines.
Our lead product candidates are:
•
Tamibarotene, a selective retinoic acid receptor alpha, or RARα, agonist for which we are conducting SELECT-MDS-1, a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine in a genomically defined subset of patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, or HR-MDS, and for which we are conducting SELECT-AML-1, a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating tamibarotene in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine in a genomically defined subset of newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, who are not suitable candidates for standard intensive chemotherapy;
•
SY-2101, a novel oral form of arsenic trioxide, or ATO, which we are evaluating in a dose confirmation study, and which we plan to follow with a Phase 3 clinical trial, in patients with newly diagnosed low-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia, or APL; and
•
SY-5609, a highly selective and potent oral inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7, or CDK7, that we are evaluating in combination with chemotherapy in relapsed/refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer patients in an expansion cohort of our existing Phase 1 clinical trial, and which we plan to evaluate as a single agent in patients with relapsed hematologic malignancies, and in combination with atezolizumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor, in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer in a Phase 1/1b clinical trial sponsored by F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, or Roche.
We also have multiple preclinical and discovery programs in oncology, including programs targeting the inhibition of CDK12, CDK11, and WRN. We expect that our next development candidate will be nominated from our CDK12 program in the second half of 2022.
In December 2019, we entered into a collaboration with Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc., or GBT, to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapies for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. We also use our gene control platform in collaboration with third parties to identify and validate targets in diseases beyond our current areas of focus. To this end, we entered into a target discovery, research collaboration and option agreement with Incyte Corporation, or Incyte, in January 2018, under which we are using our platform to identify novel therapeutic targets with a focus on myeloproliferative neoplasms.
Tamibarotene
At the 62nd American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition held in December 2020, or ASH 2020, we presented data from our fully enrolled Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine in newly diagnosed AML patients who are not suitable candidates for standard chemotherapy, as well as in relapsed or refractory, or R/R, AML patients who have been prospectively selected using our proprietary RARA, the gene that codes for RARα, biomarker. As of an October 1, 2020 data cut-off, 51 newly diagnosed unfit AML patients, including both RARA-positive and RARA-negative patients, were eligible for a safety analysis. Among these patients, tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine was generally well-tolerated, with no evidence of increased toxicity relative to either as a single agent, including rates of myelosuppression that were comparable to single-agent azacitidine. As of the data cut-off, of the 18 RARA-positive patients that were evaluable for clinical response, the overall response rate, or ORR, was 67%, with a
composite complete response rate of 61%, with 50% of patients achieving complete response, or CR, and 11% achieving a complete response with incomplete blood count recovery, or CRi. The median time to initial response was 1.2 months, the median duration of response was 10.8 months, and the median overall survival, or OS, among patients who achieved a CR or CRi was 18 months. As of the data cut-off, of the 28 RARA-negative patients that were evaluable for clinical response, the ORR was 43%, with a composite complete response rate of 32%, with 25% of patients achieving CR and 7% achieving CRi. The median time to initial response was 3.0 months, and the median duration of response was 10.3 months. We also presented translational data demonstrating that most RARA-positive newly diagnosed unfit AML patients enrolled in our Phase 2 study had a monocytic disease phenotype that is associated with resistance to venetoclax. These data suggest that the RARA biomarker not only selects for patients who are more likely to respond to treatment with tamibarotene but also for patients who may be less likely to benefit from treatment with venetoclax. Approximately 25,000 patients are diagnosed with unfit AML in the United States and Europe annually and we expect the overall total addressable market opportunity for all AML patients to grow to approximately $6.6 billion by 2025.
Based on these data and our assessment of ongoing areas of high unmet need, we advanced tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine into a registration-enabling Phase 3 clinical trial in RARA-positive newly diagnosed HR-MDS patients, which we refer to as SELECT-MDS-1. HR-MDS is a hematologic malignancy that is closely related to AML, and as in AML, about 30% of HR-MDS patients are RARA-positive. We believe that approximately 21,000 patients are diagnosed with HR-MDS in the United States and Europe annually and we expect the total addressable market opportunity for MDS patients of all risk groups to grow to approximately $3.3 billion by 2026. We plan to enroll approximately 190 RARA-positive newly diagnosed HR-MDS patients in the double-blind placebo-controlled trial, randomized 2:1 to receive tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine or placebo with azacitidine, respectively. The primary endpoint of the trial will be the CR rate. The trial is designed with 90% power and a one-sided alpha of 0.025 to detect a difference in CR rates between the experimental and control arms. We are currently dosing patients in SELECT-MDS-1, and we expect to report data from the SELECT-MDS-1 trial in the fourth quarter of 2023 or first quarter of 2024, with a potential submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, of a new drug application, or NDA, expected in 2024. In addition, we are advancing tamibarotene in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine in RARA-positive newly diagnosed unfit AML patients. The trial, which we refer to as SELECT-AML-1, is designed with a single-arm safety lead-in of approximately 15 patients to confirm the dosing regimen of the triplet to be used in the randomized portion of the Phase 2 clinical trial, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of tamibarotene in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine compared to venetoclax and azacitidine in approximately 80 patients randomized 1:1. The primary endpoint of the trial will be the composite CR rate. The trial will also evaluate the triplet as a salvage strategy for patients in the control arm who do not respond to venetoclax and azacitidine. We have begun dosing patients in the SELECT-AML-1 trial, and we expect to report clinical activity data from the safety lead-in portion of the trial in the second half of 2022.
SY-2101
In December 2020, we acquired from Orsenix, LLC, or Orsenix, a novel oral form of ATO, which we refer to as SY-2101. SY-2101 is in development for the treatment of APL, a subtype of AML defined by a fusion of the RARA and promyelocytic leukemia, or PML, genes. APL represents approximately 10% of all AML cases, and approximately 2,000 patients are diagnosed with APL in the United States and Europe annually. An intravenously administered, or IV, formulation of ATO is approved for use in combination with All-Trans-Retinoic-Acid, or ATRA, in patients with newly diagnosed low-risk APL and, while curative in more than 80% of patients, its administration requires up to 140 two- to four-hour infusions over the typical course of induction and consolidation treatment. If SY-2101 demonstrates comparable efficacy to IV ATO in our clinical studies, we believe it has the potential to become the standard-of-care frontline therapy for APL by providing a substantially more convenient option that reduces the treatment burden on patients, improving access, and lowering costs to the healthcare system. In a Phase 1 clinical trial, SY-2101 demonstrated bioavailability, pharmacokinetic, or PK, exposures similar to IV ATO, and a generally well-tolerated safety profile. We have begun dosing patients in a dose confirmation study of SY-2101. The ongoing dose confirmation study is evaluating the PK, food effect, safety and tolerability of SY-2101 and is expected to enroll between six and 24 adult APL patients undergoing consolidation with IV ATO plus ATRA. Participants receive a single dose of 15 mg of SY-2101 in both the fasted and in the fed state, and a single dose of IV ATO for PK assessments, with flexibility to allow for other SY-2101 doses to be evaluated. Daily administration of SY-2101 is also being evaluated in a multiple-dose treatment module substituting for IV ATO during consolidation to assess steady state SY-2101 PK and safety. We anticipate reporting PK and safety data in mid-2022. The feedback from a Type C meeting to review our Phase 3 study design with the FDA in November 2021 continues to support molecular complete response rate as the primary endpoint for accelerated approval and event free survival as the primary endpoint for full approval, in each case compared to historic IV ATO data. In addition, FDA feedback supports the inclusion of patients randomized to IV ATO for comparative safety assessments. Based on this feedback and following confirmation of a dose that demonstrates comparable PK exposures to IV ATO, we intend to initiate a registration-enabling Phase 3 clinical trial in approximately 215 patients with newly diagnosed
low-risk APL, randomized 2:1 to receive SY-2101 or IV ATO, in the first quarter of 2023, and to announce data from the Phase 3 clinical trial in 2025.
SY-5609
At the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress held in September 2021, or ESMO 2021, we presented data from the dose-escalation portion of the Phase 1 multi-center, open-label study of SY-5609 evaluating patients with advanced breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian and pancreatic cancers, as well as patients with solid tumors of any histology harboring Rb pathway alterations. Patients were treated in cohorts exploring continuous daily dosing as well as intermittent dosing regimens, including seven days on treatment and seven days off, or 7d on/7d off, and five days on treatment and two days off, or 5d on/2d off. As of a July 6, 2021 data cut-off, 54 patients treated with single-agent SY-5609 in the study were eligible for a safety analysis and 45 patients were evaluable for clinical response. The median age of patients enrolled in the study was 65.5. Patients had been heavily pre-treated with as many as eight prior therapies and a median of four prior therapies. Across all doses and schedules, the majority of adverse events, or AEs, were low-grade and reversible, and there was a low rate of discontinuations due to AEs. The most common treatment-emergent AEs were gastrointestinal (nausea, diarrhea, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, vomiting), fatigue, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Tolerability was optimized with the 7d on/7d off schedule, which had the lowest rates of treatment-emergent AEs relative to other regimens, while demonstrating comparable rates of stable disease, or SD, as seen with more dose-intense regimens, supporting the selection of this schedule for further development of SY-5609. The maximum tolerated dose of the 7d on/7d off schedule has not yet been reached as of the data cut-off date. Changes in POLR2A mRNA expression, a pharmacodynamic marker for CDK7 inhibition, were associated with anti-tumor activity and were sustained for at least three days following drug cessation, supporting intermittent dosing. As of the data cut-off date, thirteen response-evaluable patients (29%) had achieved SD, with tumor regressions of up to 20% in six of those patients, across multiple tumor types. The most substantial clinical activity was observed in heavily pre-treated patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, for which five of 13 (39%) evaluable patients achieved SD, with tumor reductions in two of those SD patients. Further, reductions in the CA 19-9 tumor marker, which is used in clinical practice to monitor tumor progression, were observed in three of four pancreatic cancer patients with serial CA 19-9 data, with these reductions ranging from 32% to 72%. Notably, one metastatic pancreatic cancer patient who had failed two prior lines of therapy and relapsed after a third line of treatment experienced prolonged SD of up to ten months. The analysis of clinical activity by tumor type and mutational status supported the mechanistic rationale for SY-5609 in Rb-altered and KRAS-mutant cancers.
We also presented preclinical data at ESMO 2021 evaluating the anti-tumor and PD activity of intermittent dosing regimens for SY-5609, as well as preclinical data evaluating SY-5609 as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer models. Taken together, these data further support our dose expansion strategy, including the decision to use a 7d on/7d off dosing schedule and combine with chemotherapy in patients with pancreatic cancer.
Based on these data, we intend to further develop SY-5609 by exploring indications with compelling clinical and/or preclinical activity, as well as a strong mechanistic rationale and high unmet need. We have initiated an expansion cohort that includes two arms evaluating SY-5609 in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The cohort is expected to enroll approximately 50 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer in first or second relapse who have progressed following first-line treatment with the chemotherapy regimen known as FOLFIRINOX, with one arm exploring a doublet regimen of SY-5609 in combination with gemcitabine and the other arm exploring a triplet regimen of SY-5609 with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. SY-5609 will be administered 7d on/7d off at a starting dose of 4 mg, and the combination agents will be administered at the approved doses. The study will evaluate safety and tolerability, as well as efficacy measures such as disease control rate and progression free survival. We expect to report clinical activity data of SY-5609 in combination with chemotherapy from the safety lead-in portion of the trial in the second half of 2022.
We also plan to evaluate the potential of SY-5609 in hematologic malignancies. Based on mechanistic rationale and preclinical data, which support the potential of CDK7 inhibition in a broad range of blood cancers, we plan to initially evaluate SY-5609 as a single agent in patients with relapsed hematologic malignancies. The Phase 1 trial is expected to begin in the second half of 2022, with initial data expected mid-2023, which will inform further development in specific hematologic cancers. The endpoints for this study will include safety, tolerability, and clinical activity measures.
In addition, in August 2021, we announced entry into a clinical supply agreement with Roche, pursuant to which we agreed to supply SY-5609 for a combination dosing cohort with atezolizumab in Roche’s ongoing Phase 1/1b INTRINSIC trial, which is evaluating multiple targeted therapies or immunotherapy, including atezolizumab, as single agents or in rational specified combinations in molecularly defined subsets of colorectal cancer patients. SY-5609 will be evaluated in combination with atezolizumab in patients with BRAF-mutant disease, and Roche plans for this arm of the trial to be open for enrollment in the first half of 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, Roche will sponsor and conduct the Phase 1/1b study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the combination of SY-5609 and atezolizumab and will assume all costs associated with the study. In exchange for providing SY-5609, we will receive access to the data on SY-5609 in combination with atezolizumab. We retain all rights to SY-5609.
Financial Operations Overview
Revenue
To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized $23.5 million of revenue, $19.4 million of which was related to our collaboration with GBT and $4.1 million of which was related to our target discovery collaboration with Incyte. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $15.1 million of revenue, $11.7 million of which was related to our collaboration with GBT and $3.4 million of which was related to our target discovery collaboration with Incyte. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $2.0 million of revenue, all of which was attributable to our collaboration agreement with Incyte.
Expenses
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including development of our gene control platform and the development of our product candidates, which include:
•
employee-related expenses, including salaries and benefits;
•
stock-based compensation expense;
•
external costs of funding activities performed by third parties that conduct research and development on our behalf and of purchasing supplies used in designing, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials;
•
consulting, licensing and professional fees related to research and development activities; and
•
facilities costs, depreciation and amortization and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other operating costs.
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments made to vendors for goods or services that will be received in the future for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized, even when there is no alternative future use for the research and development, until related goods or services are provided.
We typically use our employee, consultant and infrastructure resources across our research and development programs. We track outsourced development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs, other internal costs or certain external consultant costs to specific product candidates or development programs.
The following table summarizes our external research and development expenses by program, as well as expenses not allocated to programs, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
(1)
The results for the year ended December 31, 2019 include credits of $1.9 million and $1.2 million for our tamibarotene and SY-1365 clinical trials, respectively, due to a change in estimate of costs incurred over the life of these clinical trials through March 31, 2019.
(2)
Our SY-1365 clinical trial costs are included within this caption as part of our CDK7 programs. In October 2019 we announced our decision to discontinue further development of SY-1365, which was completed during the year ended December 31, 2020.
(3)
In December 2020, we acquired SY-2101, a product candidate in development for the treatment of APL, from Orsenix. In connection with this acquisition, we made an up-front payment of $12.0 million to Orsenix, which we recorded as research and development expenses.
We expect our research and development expenses will increase for the foreseeable future as we seek to advance our programs. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of our product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from sales of our product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing such product candidates, including the uncertainty of:
•
successful completion of preclinical studies, including activities related to preparation of investigational new drug applications, or INDs, and minimally efficacious dose studies in animals, where applicable and required, under the requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or another regulatory authority;
•
approval of INDs for our product candidates to commence planned or future clinical trials;
•
successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials;
•
successful data from our clinical programs that support an acceptable benefit-risk profile of our product candidates in the intended populations;
•
successful development, and subsequent clearance or approval, of companion diagnostic tests for use in identifying potential patients;
•
receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•
establishment of arrangements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply and commercial manufacturing and, where applicable, commercial manufacturing capabilities;
•
establishment and maintenance of patent and trade secret protection or regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates;
•
commercial launch of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;
•
enforcement and defense of intellectual property rights and claims;
•
maintenance of a continued acceptable safety profile of the product candidates following approval;
•
retention of key research and development personnel; and
•
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Any changes in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates in preclinical and clinical development could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of these product candidates. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to delay our planned start of clinical trials or require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we currently expect or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our planned clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development of our product candidates.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, information technology and administrative functions. Other significant costs include corporate facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees related to patent and corporate matters, and fees for accounting and consulting services.
We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research activities and development of our product candidates.
Interest Income
Interest income consists of interest income on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments in marketable securities, including the related amortization of premium and discounts.
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists of interest, amortization of debt discount, and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our loans payable, and interest on finance lease arrangements.
Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability
Change in fair value of warrant liability is the result of the remeasurement of the fair value of our warrant liability at each reporting period end.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimates.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates.
Revenue
To date our only revenue has consisted of collaboration and license revenue. We have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized $23.5 million of revenue, $19.4 million of which was related to our collaboration with GBT and $4.1 million of which was related to our target discovery collaboration with Incyte. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $15.1 million of revenue, $11.7 million of which was related to our collaboration with
GBT and $3.4 million of which was related to our target discovery collaboration with Incyte. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $2.0 million of revenue, all of which was attributable to our target discovery collaboration with Incyte.
We recognize revenue in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606. ASC 606 applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and financial instruments. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps:
(i)
identify the contract(s) with a customer;
(ii)
identify the performance obligations in the contract;
(iii)
determine the transaction price;
(iv)
allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
(v)
recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration to which we are entitled in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations, and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.
From time to time, we may enter into agreements that are within the scope of ASC 606. The terms of these arrangements typically include payment to us of one or more of the following: non-refundable, up-front license fees, prepaid research and development services, development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments; and royalties on net sales of licensed products. Each of these payments would result in license and collaboration revenues, except for revenues from royalties on net sales of licensed products, which will be classified as royalty revenues.
We analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements, or ASC 808, to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808 that contain multiple elements, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore within the scope of ASC 606. For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to ASC 606. For those elements of the arrangement that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 606, we apply the five-step model described above.
Research and Development Expenses
Expenditures relating to research and development are expensed in the period incurred. Research and development expenses consist of both internal and external costs associated with the development of our gene control platform and product candidates. Research and development costs include salaries and benefits, materials and supplies, external research, preclinical and clinical development expenses, stock-based compensation expense and facilities costs. Facilities costs primarily include the allocation of rent, utilities, depreciation and amortization.
In certain circumstances, we are required to make nonrefundable advance payments to vendors for goods or services that will be received in the future for use in research and development activities. In such circumstances, the nonrefundable advance payments are deferred and capitalized, even when there is no alternative future use for the research and development, until related goods or services are provided.
We record accruals for estimated ongoing research costs. When evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities, we analyze progress of the work being performed, including the phase or completion of the event, invoices received and costs. Significant judgements and estimates may be made in determining the accrued balances at the end of any reporting period. Actual results could differ from our estimates.
We may in-license the rights to develop and commercialize product candidates. For each in-license transaction, we evaluate whether we have acquired processes or activities along with inputs that would be sufficient to constitute a “business” as defined under U.S. GAAP. A “business” as defined under U.S. GAAP consists of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that have the ability to create outputs. Although businesses usually have outputs, outputs are not required for an integrated set of activities to qualify as a business. When we determine that we have not acquired sufficient processes or activities to constitute a business, any up-front payments, as well as milestone payments, are immediately expensed as acquired research and development in the period in which they are incurred.
Warrants
We account for our issued warrants as either liability or equity in accordance with ASC 480-10, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, or ASC 480-10, or ASC 815-40, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock, or ASC 815-40. Under ASC 480-10, warrants are considered liability if they are mandatorily redeemable and they require settlement in cash or other assets, or a variable number of shares. If warrants do not meet liability classification under ASC 480-10, we consider the requirements of ASC 815-40 to determine whether the warrants should be classified as liability or equity. Under ASC 815-40, contracts that may require settlement for cash are liabilities, regardless of the probability of the occurrence of the triggering event. Liability classified warrants are measured at fair value on the issuance date and at the end of each reporting period. Any change in the fair value of the warrants after the issuance date is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as a gain or loss. If warrants do not require liability classification under ASC 815-40, in order to conclude warrants should be classified as equity, the Company assesses whether the warrants are indexed to its common stock and whether the warrants are classified as equity under ASC 815-40 or other applicable GAAP. Equity classified warrants are accounted for at fair value on the issuance date with no changes in fair value recognized after the issuance date.
On December 8, 2020, through a private placement, we issued 10,312,500 shares of our common stock and, in lieu of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of common stock, and, in each case, accompanying warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 2,828,125 additional shares of common stock (or pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock in lieu thereof) at a price of $8.00 per share and accompanying warrant (or $7.99 per pre-funded warrant and accompanying warrant). The private placement resulted in aggregate gross proceeds of $90.5 million, before $0.4 million of transaction costs.
In the event of certain fundamental transactions, the holders of warrants may require us to make a payment based on a Black-Scholes valuation, using specified inputs. The holders of the pre-funded warrants issued in the December 2020 private placement do not have similar rights. Therefore, we accounted for the warrants as a liability, while the pre-funded warrants met the permanent equity criteria classification. The pre-funded warrants are classified as a component of permanent equity because they are freestanding financial instruments that are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the shares of common stock with which they were issued, are immediately exercisable, do not embody an obligation for us to repurchase those shares, and permit the holders to receive a fixed number of shares of common stock upon exercise. In addition, the Pre-Funded Warrants do not provide any guarantee of value or return. The initial fair value of the warrants at issuance was $19.3 million, determined using Black-Scholes valuation model. We remeasured the warrant’s fair value at December 31, 2021 and 2020 as $3.0 million and $19.7 million, respectively. The change in fair value of $16.7 million (loss) and $0.4 million (gain) was recorded in our consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
We account for our stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of restricted stock units and stock option awards, to be recognized as expense in the consolidated statements of operations based on their grant date fair values. Effective January 1, 2019, grants of restricted stock units and stock option awards to other service providers, referred to as non-employees, are measured based on the grant-date fair value of the award and expensed in our consolidated statement of operations over the vesting period. Through December 31, 2018, grants of restricted stock unit and stock option awards to non-employees were required to be recognized as expense in the consolidated statements of operations based on their vesting date fair values. We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. Prior to June 30, 2016, we were a private company and, therefore, lack company-specific historical and implied volatility information. As a result, we estimate our expected stock volatility based on a combination of our historical volatility and that of a publicly traded set of peer companies. We expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our own traded stock price. The expected term of our stock options has been determined utilizing the “simplified” method for awards that qualify as “plain-vanilla” options. Through December 31, 2018, the expected term of stock options granted to non-employees was equal to the contractual term of the option award. Effective January 1, 2019, the expected term of stock options to non-employees can be determined using either the contractual term of the option award or the “simplified” method. We elected to continue to use the contractual term in determining the expected term of stock option to non-employees. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We use the value of our common stock to determine the fair value of restricted stock awards.
We expense the fair value of our stock-based awards to employees and non-employees on a straight-line basis over the associated service period, which is generally the vesting period. We account for forfeitures as they occur instead of estimating forfeitures at the time of grant. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will be for only those options that vest.
Compensation expense for discounted purchases under the employee stock purchase plan is measured using the Black-Scholes model to compute the fair value of the lookback provision plus the purchase discount and is recognized as compensation expense over the offering period.
For stock-based awards that contain performance-based milestones, we record stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the accelerated attribution model. Management evaluates when the achievement of a performance-based milestone is probable based on the expected satisfaction of the performance conditions as of the reporting date. For certain of our performance-based awards, notwithstanding any vesting in accordance with the achievement of performance-based milestones, such awards vest in full on the sixth anniversary of the vesting commencement date. Compensation expense for such awards is recognized over the six-year vesting period unless management determines that the achievement of any performance-based milestones is probable, in which case expense is accelerated. Compensation expense related to these awards were all recognized as of December 31, 2020 as the performance-based milestones were achieved.
We have computed the fair value of stock options at the date of grant using the following weighted-average assumptions:
Results of Operations
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, together with the changes in those items in dollars (in thousands):
Revenue
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized approximately $23.5 million of revenue, $19.4 million of which was attributable to our collaboration with GBT and $4.1 million of which was attributable to our target discovery collaboration with Incyte. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $15.1 million of revenue, $11.7 million of which was attributable to our collaboration with GBT and $3.4 million of which was attributable to our target discovery collaboration with Incyte.
Research and Development Expense
Research and development expense increased by approximately $23.8 million, or 31%, from $76.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $99.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, together with the changes to those items in dollars (in thousands):
The change in research and development expense was primarily attributable to research and development activities associated with advancing our lead clinical and preclinical programs and enhancing our internal capabilities, and included the following:
•
an increase of approximately $13.8 million, or 32%, in external research and development, primarily attributable to the increases in costs associated with the continued advancement of our existing clinical trials of tamibarotene, SY-2101 and SY-5609 and advancement of our preclinical programs, including our sickle cell disease development activities in collaboration with GBT;
•
an increase of approximately $5.6 million, or 30%, for employee-related expenses, including increased salary and benefits primarily due to our increased headcount;
•
an increase of approximately $2.9M, or 84%, for consulting, licensing and professional fees, primarily related to the advancement of our clinical and pre-clinical programs;
•
an increase of approximately $1.0 million, or 21%, for stock-based compensation, also primarily due to our increased headcount; and
•
an increase of approximately $0.5 million, or 8%, in facilities and other expenses primarily due to the rent expense related to the lease for our headquarters.
General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative expense increased by approximately $1.7 million, or 8%, from $21.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The change in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to an increase in employee-related expenses driven by increased headcount, COVID-19 testing expenses incurred by us to support the health and safety of our employees, an increase in legal costs including patent prosecution expenses, and an increase in consulting fees.
Interest Income
Interest income was derived from our investments in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The decrease in interest income during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to lower yield on our investments in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities due to capital market conditions during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was related to our credit facility with Oxford Finance LLC, or Oxford, and equipment financing arrangements. The increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was driven by a higher average outstanding balance of our credit facility with Oxford during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability
The increase in the change in fair value of warrant liability during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was a result of the remeasurement of the fair values of warrants issued in connection with the private placement financing in December 2020.
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, together with the changes in those items in dollars (in thousands):
Revenue
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized approximately $15.1 million of revenue, $11.7 million of which was attributable to our collaboration with GBT and $3.4 million of which was attributable to our target discovery collaboration with Incyte. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $2.0 million of revenue, all of which was attributable to our target discovery collaboration with Incyte.
Research and Development Expense
Research and development expense increased by approximately $17.8 million, or 31%, from $58.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $76.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, together with the changes to those items in dollars (in thousands):
The change in research and development expense was primarily attributable to research and development activities associated with advancing our lead clinical and preclinical programs and enhancing our internal capabilities, and included the following:
•
an increase of approximately $12.9 million, or 43%, in external research and development, primarily attributable to the $12.0 million paid to Orsenix for the acquisition of the SY-2101, and due to the increases in costs associated with the continued advancement of our existing clinical trials of SY-5609 and tamibarotene and advancement of our preclinical programs, including our sickle cell disease development activities in collaboration with GBT;
•
an increase of approximately $3.0 million, or 19%, for employee-related expenses, including increased salary and benefits primarily due to our increased headcount;
•
an increase of approximately $1.3 million, or 36%, for stock-based compensation, also primarily due to our increased headcount; and
•
an increase of approximately $0.7 million, or 13%, in facilities and other expenses primarily due to the rent expense related to the lease for our headquarters, over which we took possession for accounting purposes in May 2019.
General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative expense remained consistent during the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. A slight decrease in consulting and outside services fees led to a decrease in general and administrative expense of approximately $0.2 million, or 1%, from $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $21.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Interest Income
Interest income was derived from our investments in cash equivalents and marketable securities. The decrease in interest income during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to lower yield on our investments in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities due to capital market conditions in light of the COVID-19 pandemic during the majority of the year ended December 31, 2020.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was related to our credit facility with Oxford Finance LLC, or Oxford, and equipment financing arrangements. The increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was driven by proceeds of $39.6 million, net of issuance costs, from our credit facility with Oxford, which was drawn in two tranches in February 2020 and December 2020.
Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability
The increase in the change in fair value of warrant liability during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was a result of the remeasurement of the fair values of warrants issued in connection with the private placement financing in December 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
We funded our operations from inception through December 31, 2021 primarily through the sale of equity securities, through license and collaboration agreements, including those with Incyte and GBT, and through the credit facility with Oxford.
On February 12, 2020, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, or the Loan Agreement, with Oxford. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, a term loan of up to an aggregate principal amount of $60.0 million is available to the Company. A $20.0 million term loan was funded on February 12, 2020, and another $20.0 million term loan was funded on December 23, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, $20.0 million remains available under the Loan Agreement, at the sole discretion of Oxford.
On June 12, 2020, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to register for sale from time to time up to $300.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and/or units in one or more registered offerings. The registration statement was declared effective on June 22, 2020. Further, in June 2020, we entered into an at-the-market sales agreement, or the 2020 sales agreement, with Cowen and Company, LLC, or Cowen, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $75.0 million through Cowen pursuant to the registration statement. We did not issue any shares of common stock pursuant to the 2020 sales agreement during the year ended December 31, 2021.
In January 2021, we issued shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering resulting in gross proceeds of $75.6 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other transaction expenses of approximately $5.1 million, pursuant to the Form S-3 that was filed with the SEC on June 12, 2020.
As of December 31, 2021, $75.0 million of our common stock remained available for future issuance under the 2020 sales agreement.
As of December 31, 2021, $224.4 million of securities remained available for issuance under the shelf registration statement.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $143.4 million.
Cash Flows
The following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
Net Cash Used in Operating Activities
The use of cash in all periods presented resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in components of working capital.
Net cash used in operating activities was $99.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $57.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a $17.1 million increase in loss from operations during the year ended December 31, 2021 and a $20.0 million collection of the advanced payment pursuant to our collaboration agreement with GBT during the year ended December 31, 2020, which did not recur during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Net cash used in operating activities was $57.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $60.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a $20.0 million collection of the advanced payment pursuant to our collaboration agreement with GBT, offset by higher operating expenses associated with our ongoing preclinical and clinical development activities and the asset acquisition of SY-2101 during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $52.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $46.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to our reinvestment of $51.4 million of our funds from cash equivalents into marketable securities and the purchase of $1.2 million of property and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to our reinvestment of $50.0 million of our funds from marketable securities upon their maturities into cash equivalents, partially offset by our $3.3 million purchase of property and equipment.
Net cash provided by investing activities was $46.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $11.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to our reinvestment of $50.0 million of our funds from marketable securities upon their maturities into cash equivalents during the year ended December 31, 2020, and our purchase of $12.6 million of property and equipment for the buildout of our corporate headquarters during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $70.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $143.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was the result of net proceeds of $70.3 million from an underwritten public offering of shares of our common stock, $0.2 million from the issuance of shares of our common stock through our 2016 Stock Incentive Plan and $0.3 million from the issuance of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan, offset by payments of $0.3 million under our capital lease obligations. Cash provided by financing activities for year ended December 31, 2020 of $143.0 million was the result of net proceeds of $39.6 million drawn from our credit facility with Oxford, $90.4 million from the issuance of securities in the December 2020 private placement, $11.9 million from the issuance of shares of our common stock pursuant to the 2017 sales agreement, $1.1 million from the issuance of shares of our common stock through our 2015 Stock Incentive Plan and $0.4 million from issuance of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan, offset by payments of $0.2 million under our capital lease obligations and payments of $0.2 million of offering costs.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $143.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $66.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was the result of net proceeds of $39.6 million drawn from our credit facility with Oxford, $90.4 million from the issuance of securities in the December 2020 private placement, $11.9 million from the issuance of shares of our common stock pursuant to the 2017 sales agreement, $1.1 million from the issuance of shares of our common stock through our 2016 Stock Incentive Plan and $0.4 million from issuance of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan, offset by payments of $0.2 million under our capital lease obligations and payments of $0.2 million of offering costs. Cash provided by financing activities for year ended December 31, 2019 of $66.0 million was primarily due to $65.0 million in net proceeds raised through two concurrent public offerings of equity securities that closed in April 2019.
Material Cash Requirements from Known Contractual Obligations
Our material cash requirements from known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021 consisted of:

Funding Requirements and Going Concern
We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue to advance our clinical trials of tamibarotene, SY-2101 and SY-5609, seek to develop companion diagnostic tests for use with our product candidates, initiate new research and preclinical development projects and seek marketing approval for any product candidates that we successfully develop. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to establishing sales, marketing, distribution and other commercial infrastructure to commercialize such products. We will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce, eliminate, or out-license our research and development programs or future commercialization rights to our product candidates.
Our future funding requirements, both short-term and long-term, will depend on many factors, including:
•
the scope, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials of tamibarotene, SY-2101 and SY-5609 and any associated companion diagnostic tests;
•
research and preclinical development efforts for any future product candidates that we may develop;
•
the number of future product candidates that we pursue and their development requirements;
•
our ability to enter into, and the terms and timing of, any collaborations, licensing agreements or other arrangements;
•
whether a drug candidate will be nominated to enter into investigational new drug application-enabling studies under our sickle cell disease collaboration with GBT, whether GBT will exercise its option to exclusively license intellectual property arising from the collaboration, whether and when any option exercise fees,
milestone payments or royalties under the collaboration agreement with GBT will ever be paid, and whether we exercise our U.S. co-promotion option under the GBT agreement;
•
whether our target discovery collaboration with Incyte will yield any validated targets, whether Incyte will exercise any of its options to exclusively license intellectual property directed to such targets, and whether and when any of the target validation fees, option exercise fees, milestone payments or royalties under the collaboration agreement with Incyte will ever be paid;
•
the outcome, timing and costs of seeking regulatory approvals;
•
the costs of commercialization activities for any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval to the extent such costs are not the responsibility of any collaborators, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing capabilities;
•
the costs of acquiring potential new product candidates or technology;
•
the costs of any physician education programs relating to selecting and treating genomically defined patient populations;
•
the timing and amount of milestone and other payments due to licensors for patent and technology rights used in our gene control platform or to TMRC Co. Ltd., or TMRC, associated with the development, manufacture and commercialization of tamibarotene;
•
the timing and amount of milestone payments due to Orsenix associated with the development and commercialization of SY-2101;
•
revenue received from commercial sales, if any, of our current and future product candidates;
•
our headcount growth and associated costs as we advance our research and development programs and establish a commercial infrastructure;
•
the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property related claims; and
•
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes many years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our common stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.
If we raise funds through additional collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
We have incurred significant annual net operating losses in every year since our inception. We expect to continue to incur significant and increasing net operating losses for at least the next several years. Our net losses were $86.6 million, $84.0 million and $75.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of
December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $463.6 million. We have not generated any revenues from product sales, have not completed the development of any product candidate and may never have a product candidate approved for commercialization. We have financed our operations to date primarily through a credit facility, the sale of equity securities and through license and collaboration agreements. We have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to research and development and general and administrative expense to support such research and development. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Net losses and negative cash flows have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders’ equity and working capital.
As discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements accompanying this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under ASC Topic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern, management is required at each reporting period to evaluate whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. This evaluation initially does not take into consideration the potential mitigating effect of management’s plans that have not been fully implemented as of the date the financial statements are issued.
Based on our current operating plan, we anticipate that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $143.4 million as of December 31, 2021 will allow us to meet our liquidity requirements into the first quarter of 2023. Our history of significant losses, our negative cash flows from operations, our limited liquidity resources currently on hand, and our dependence on its ability to obtain additional financing to fund our operations after the current resources are exhausted, about which there can be no certainty, have resulted in our assessment that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the issuance date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we have plans in place to mitigate this risk, which primarily consist of raising additional capital through a combination of equity or debt financings and potential new collaborations, and reducing cash expenditures, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in these mitigation efforts.
