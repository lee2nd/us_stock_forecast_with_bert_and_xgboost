Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
References to the “Company,” “us,” “our” or “we” refer to KludeIn I Acquisition Corp. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes included herein.
The following discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the notes related thereto which are included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations has been amended and restated to give effect to the restatement of our financial statements as of March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021, and September 30, 2021 (the “Affected Periods”).
Subsequent to the filing of the Form 10-Q/A, Amendment No. 1 for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2021, management identified an error made in its historical Financial Statements where at the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we did not properly record the Founders Shares attributable to the Anchor Investor by our Sponsor. We concluded that the fair value of the Founder Shares should be recorded as an offering cost with corresponding credit to additional paid-in-capital, in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A and Topic 5T. As a result, the offering costs should be allocated to the separable financial instruments issued in the Initial Public Offering using the with-and-without method, compared to total proceeds received. This resulted in restatement to the Affected Periods.
Overview
We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 24, 2020, for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses. We intend to effectuate our business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.
We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a business combination will be successful.
Results of Operations
We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from September 24, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2021 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below, and subsequent to the initial public offering, identifying a target company for a business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income and unrealized gains on marketable securities held in a Trust Account, and gains or losses from the change in fair value of the warrant liabilities. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had a net loss of $406,026, which consists of the change in fair value of the warrant liabilities of $1,642,290, unrealized gain on marketable securities held in Trust Account of $2,211 and interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $78,398, offset by formation and operational costs of $1,605,912 and transaction costs allocated to warrant liabilities of $523,013.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, we had a net loss of $434,039, which consists of formation and operational costs of $931,960 and transaction costs allocated to warrants of $523,013, partially offset by the change in fair value of the warrant liabilities of $961,676, unrealized gain on marketable securities held in Trust Account of $1,361, and interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $57,897.
For the six months ended June 30, 2021, we had a net loss of $1,459,167, which consists of formation and operational costs of $645,127, change in fair value of the warrant liability of $328,500, transaction costs allocated to warrants of $523,013 and unrealized loss on marketable securities held in Trust Account of $2,373, offset by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $39,846.
For the three months ended March 31, 2021, we had net income of $1,388,100, which consists of changes in fair value of the warrant liability of $2,212,000 and interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $33,277, partially offset by operating and formation costs of $333,548, transaction costs allocated to warrants of $523,013 and an unrealized loss on marketable securities held in Trust Account of $616.
For the period from September 24, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020, we had a net loss of $1,893, which consisted of formation and operational costs.
Factors That May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations
Our results of operations and our ability to complete an initial business combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted by, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in interest rates, supply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including resurgences and the emergence of new variants, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflict in the Ukraine. We cannot at this time fully predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete an initial business combination.
Liquidity and Going Concern
On January 11, 2021, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 17,250,000 units, at a price of $10.00 per unit, which included the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 2,250,000 units, generating gross proceeds of $172,500,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 5,200,000 private placement warrants to the sponsor at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant generating gross proceeds of $5,200,000.
Following the Initial Public Offering, the full exercise of the over-allotment option, and the sale of the private placement warrants, a total of $172,500,000 was placed in the Trust Account. We incurred $14,303,235 in transaction costs, including $3,450,000 of underwriting fees, $6,037,500 of deferred underwriting fees, $4,411,238 of fair value of the Founder Shares attributable to the Anchor Investor and $404,497 of other offering costs.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, cash used in operating activities was $970,669. Net loss of $406,026 was affected by changes in fair value of the warrant liabilities of $1,642,290, interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $78,398, transaction costs allocated to warrants of $523,013 and an unrealized gain on marketable securities held in Trust Account of $2,211. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $635,243 of cash for operating activities.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, cash used in operating activities was $897,443. Net loss of $434,039 was affected by changes in fair value of the warrant liabilities of $961,676, interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $57,897, transaction costs allocated to warrants of $523,013 and an unrealized gain on marketable securities held in Trust Account of $1,361. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $34,517 of cash for operating activities.
For the six months ended June 30, 2021, cash used in operating activities was $858,964. Net loss of $1,459,167 was affected by changes in fair value of the warrant liability of $328,500, interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $39,846, transaction costs allocated to warrants of $523,013 and an unrealized loss on marketable securities held in Trust Account of $2,373. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used $213,837 of cash for operating activities.
For the three months ended March 31, 2021, cash used in operating activities was $740,392. Net income of $1,388,100 was affected by changes in fair value of the warrant liability of $2,212,000, interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $33,277, transaction costs incurred in connection with the Initial Public Offering of $523,013 and an unrealized loss on marketable securities held in Trust Account of $616. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used $406,844 of cash for operating activities.
For the period from September 24, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $1,000. Net loss of $1,893 was affected by formation cost paid by sponsor through promissory note of $761 and changes in operating assets and liabilities which provided $2,132 of cash for operating activities.
At December 31, 2021, we had cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $172,580,609 (including approximately $80,000 of interest income, including unrealized gain) consisting of U.S. treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less. Interest income on the balance in the Trust Account may be used by us to pay taxes. Through December 31, 2021, we had not withdrawn any interest earned from the Trust Account.
We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less deferred underwriting commissions and income taxes payable), to complete our business combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.
At December 31, 2021, we had cash of $400,073. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a business combination.
In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, our sponsors or an affiliate of our sponsors or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required (“Working Capital Loans”). Such Working Capital Loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. If we complete a business combination, we may repay the notes out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us. In the event that a business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay the notes, but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. On January 21, 2022, we issued a promissory in the principal amount of up to $1,500,000 to our sponsor and drew $462,500 under this arrangement. The note is non-interest bearing and payable upon the consummation of a business combination or may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants.
As indicated in the accompanying financial statements, at December 31, 2021, the Company had $400,073 in cash, and a working capital deficit of $156,693, which excludes $80,609 of interest earned on Trust which is available to pay Delaware franchise taxes payable.
The Company’s liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering were satisfied through the proceeds of $25,000 from the sale of founder shares, and loans from the sponsor of approximately $89,000. The loan was repaid in full on January 11, 2021. Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company’s liquidity has been satisfied through the net proceeds received from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of private placement warrants.
In connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Codification Topic 205-40, “Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern,” the Company has until July 11, 2022, to consummate an initial business combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate an initial business combination by this time. If an initial business combination is not consummated by this date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. Additionally, the Company may not have sufficient liquidity to fund the working capital needs of the Company through one year from the issuance of these financial statements. Management has determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation, should an initial business combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after July 11, 2022. The Company’s sponsor, officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company’s working capital needs. On January 21, 2022, we issued a working capital loan in the principal amount of up to $1,500,000 to our sponsor. On January 31, 2022, the Company drew $350,000 on the Working Capital Loan. On April 1, 2022, the Company drew an additional $112,500 on the Working Capital Loan.
Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements
We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2021. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.
Contractual Obligations
We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities.
The underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of $0.35 per unit, or $6,037,500 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete a business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have not identified any critical accounting policies.
Warrant Liabilities
The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in FASB ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own shares of common stock, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding.
For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. For the private placement warrants, the fair value was estimated using a binomial lattice model incorporating the Cox-Rss-Rubenstein methodology at the closing date of the Initial Public Offering and as of December 31, 2021. For the public warrants, the fair value was estimated using a binomial lattice model incorporating the Cox-Rss-Rubenstein methodology at the closing date of the Initial Public Offering and the level 1 quoted prices in an active market as of December 31, 2021.
Class A Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption
We account for our common stock subject to possible conversion in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Class A common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. Our Class A common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, all shares of Class A common stock subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets.
Net Loss Per Share of Common Stock
Net loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The Company applies the two-class method in calculating loss per share of common stock. Re-measurement associated with the redeemable shares of Class A common stock is excluded from loss per common share as the redemption value approximates fair value. Net income or loss is allocated among the classes of ordinary shares based on weighted average shares outstanding.
The calculation of diluted loss per share of common stock does not consider the effect of the warrants issued in connection with the (i) initial public offering, and (ii) the private placement since the exercise of the warrants is contingent upon the occurrence of future events. The warrants are exercisable to purchase 13,825,000 shares of Class A common stock in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not have any other dilutive securities or other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted net loss per common share is the same as basic net loss per common share for the periods presented.
Recent Accounting Standards
In August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2020-06, “Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity” (“ASU 2020-06”), which simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current U.S. GAAP. The ASU also removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity-linked contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, and it simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. We early adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2021. Adoption of the ASU did not impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements.
