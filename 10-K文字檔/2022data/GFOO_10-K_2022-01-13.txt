ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements, including the Notes thereto, for the years ended September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2021, beginning on Page.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Overview
During our historic period, we were a start-up company whose main focus was to promote, market, distribute and export a range of enzyme products manufactured in the United States for sale for human and animal consumption in certain Asian markets, including ASEAN. Our objective was to commence marketing and distribution of a range of enzyme products for human and animal consumption to sole country distributors, wholesalers, dealers and retailers, as well as to the general public following a Multi-Level Marketing - Franchise Investor Dealer Related (MLM-FIDR) concept, beginning in Taiwan, and then China, Hong Kong, Macau, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Sri Lanka.
At some point, which we believe may have occurred approximately mid- to late-2016, Oliver Lin’s management ceased operating our original business. We have not generated any revenue from operations since that time.
In 2019 and through the end of fiscal 2021, we explored plans to restart our enzyme products business or develop a new business. In 2019 and through early 2020, we had planned to restart our original enzyme products business, by importing enzyme supplements from the United States for sale in Taiwan. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all non-COVID-19 related matters, including obtaining an import license from Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Taiwan FDA, were delayed or were taking longer than usual in Taiwan beginning in late-January 2020. For various reasons, including the fact that, without a reasonably foreseeable end of the pandemic and Taiwan government resources being shifted to dealing with the pandemic, we decided to abandon the plan to restart our enzyme products business.
During fiscal year 2020, we announced that we were in the preliminary stage of developing a new business plan to sell and distribute physiological sea water and nasal spray in Taiwan and the United States. However, after exploring this possible business as a result of several factors, including but not limited to difficulties in commencing a new business during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we decided not to pursue the nasal spray business.
In September 2020, we announced that we were exploring business opportunities for medical mask, medical-grade gloves and possibly other PPE. During fiscal 2021, due to lack of sufficient funding, we decided not to pursue the PPE business. We continued to explore other products with high demand since the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically rapid test kits. However, due to lack of funding and other factors, including the size of enterprise needed to successfully carry out such a business, we no longer intend to pursue this business.
At this time, we have no specific plan to commence any particular new business. Our focus will be to consider either or both of a possible business combination, which may include but not be limited to a reverse merger, with another operating business, or commencing a business of our own. However, we reserve the right to further change our business plan at any time.
Hukui Investment
In late September 2020, we announced that Hukui and we had entered into the Hukui Agreement, pursuant to which we agreed to purchase an aggregate 200,000 shares of Hukui’s Series C Preferred Shares at $10.00 per share, for an aggregate investment of $2,000,000.
The Hukui Agreement provided that we would purchase the Series C Preferred Shares in three tranches, through a date on or before June 30, 2022, as follows:
● The First Tranche Investment is 80,000 Series C Preferred Shares in the amount of $800,000, such shares having been purchased by us on December 15, 2020 in the First Tranche Closing;
● The Second Tranche Investment is 60,000 Series C Preferred Shares in the amount of $600,000, such shares having been purchased by us on June 25, 2021 in the Second Tranche Closing; and
● The Third Tranche Investment is 60,000 Series C Preferred Shares in the amount of $600,000, such shares to have been purchased on or before June 30, 2022 in the Third Tranche Closing.
Following the end of our 2021 fiscal year, the Purchaser, Hukui and we entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which we agreed to sell the 140,000 Hukui Shares that we had purchased in the First Tranche Closing and the Second Tranche Closing to the Purchaser for $350,000 in cash, or $2.50 per share. The sale of the Hukui Shares closed on November 19, 2021.
We had purchased the Hukui Shares in two tranches, on December 15, 2020 and June 30, 2021, pursuant to the Hukui Agreement, at $10.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $1,400,000. We sold the Hukui Shares at $2.50 per share, for a total price of $350,000, resulting in loss of $1,050,000. We recognized impairment loss of the market value of the shares of $1,050,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021. See Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
On December 17, 2021, Hukui and we entered into the Termination Agreement, pursuant to which our obligation to make the Third Tranche Investment was terminated and the Hukui Agreement was terminated. As a result, we have no continuing contractual obligation to make any investment in Hukui.
If we decide to develop a plan of operations for a new business, we will need to raise capital to pursue such a business. There are no commitments in place to fund any such business and no guarantee can be given that we will be able to secure such funding on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.
For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, Jui Pin (John) Lin, our former President and Chief Executive Officer, periodically provided the capital we needed to operate in the form of loans in the aggregate principal amount of $120,410, the principal and accrued and unpaid interest of which are convertible, at his option, into shares of our Common Stock at $0.05 per share. On December 28, 2020, we repaid Mr. Lin $65,410 of the principal amount of loans due and payable plus accrued interest in the amount of $1,162, for a total of $66,572. On January 5, 2021, we repaid Mr. Lin $20,000 of the principal amount of another such loan due and payable plus accrued interest in the amount of $403, for a total of $20,403.
On August 26, 2020, Jui Pin (John) Lin loaned us $35,000 at 4% interest rate and six months’ maturity. The loan was repaid on February 26, 2021 in the principal amount of $35,000, together with interest in the amount of of $706, for a total of $35,706.
On October 9, 2020, another stockholder loaned us $30,000 (the “October 2020 Loan”), on substantially the same terms as the terms of the loans from Mr. Lin. On April 9, 2021, the lender converted the outstanding principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest in the amount of $598, into 3,059,836 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, at a rate of $0.01 per share.
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, we raised an aggregate $1.8 million in two private offerings, the Fall 2020 Offering and the Spring 2021 Offering, to raise the capital needed to fund our operations and make the First Tranche Investment and Second Tranche Investment in Hukui.
We may also raise equity, debt, convertible debt or a combination of any of the foregoing, from other parties for the capital we may need for any of the purposes specified in this report. There is no agreement in place between the Company and anyone for such capital to continue to be made available to us as needed, and we cannot guarantee that any such capital will continue to be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, in the future.
Results of Operations
Year Ended September 30, 2021 compared to the Year Ended September 30, 2020
Revenues
We did not generate any revenues during the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020.
Operating expenses
We incurred total operating expenses of $363,637 and $309,907 for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our operating expenses consist of legal fees, other professional fees, payroll expenses, rent, bank charges, and transfer agent fees. The increase in operating expenses for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period ended in 2020 was primarily due to increase in legal fees and consultant fees.
Other income (expense)
During the year ended September 30, 2021, we had a net other income of $52,250, which included incurred $78,476 of other income due to liabilities written off, partially offset by a $25,000 penalty plus interest of $1,226 from the IRS for failing to file Form 5472 timely. We did not have other income during the year ended September 30, 2020. During the year ended September 30, 2021 we incurred $1,050,000 impairment loss of investment. We invested $1,400,000 in Hukui’s Series C Preferred stock, which is sold on November 17, 2021 for $350,000, resulting in loss of $1,050,000. We wrote down the investment on September 30, 2021 to reflect fair market value of the investment.
Investment impairment loss
Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, we sold the Hukui Shares on November 19, 2021 for $350,000 in cash, or $2.50 per share. The sale of the Hukui Shares resulted in loss of $1,050,000. We recognized impairment loss of the market value of the shares of $1,050,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021. See Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Contingent liability
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, we received a $25,000 penalty from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) for failure to file Form 5472, Information Return of a 25% Foreign-Owned U.S. Corporation or a Foreign Corporation Engaged in a U.S. Trade or Business, for the year ended September 30, 2020. We are currently seeking forgiveness of the penalty and interest thereon in the amount of $1,226, for a total of $26,226, which was still pending as of September 30, 2021.
Net Loss
As a result of the above, our net loss increased from $311,109 in the year ended September 30, 2020 to $1,364,432 in the same period ended in 2021.
Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our Business
While our liquidity and capital resources are severely limited and present serious obstacles to starting a business or continuing to meet or obligations to invest in Hukui, these limitations are unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global economic crisis.
We have been affected by the pandemic to the extent that it was one of a number of contributing factors in our decision to change our plan of operations from restarting our enzyme products business to selling the nasal spray product and then deciding not to pursue the nasal spray product business, although the first of those two decisions was largely made prior to the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our personnel are in Taiwan, which, until recently, has been relatively less affected by the pandemic compared to many other countries in Asia, Europe and the United States. Even before an increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 in Taiwan, we expected to experience delays in obtaining business licenses and permits, and any other governmental approvals that may be required for a future business, since government offices are continuing to work with reduced staff during the pandemic. With the recent increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in Taiwan, we expect this situation to continue and possibly become more challenging.
Depending upon the extent and duration of the pandemic and the resulting global economic crisis, these conditions may have an adverse impact on our ability to raise capital and commence any business we may pursue. Depending upon possible changes in consumer demand, shopping and spending habits as a result of the pandemic and the resulting global economic crisis, we may also face challenges of consumer acceptance if and when we start to market any products.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Working Capital
As of September 30, 2021, we had current assets of $35,044 and a working capital deficit of $70,302. In comparison, as of September 30, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $18,092 and a working capital deficit of $352,943.
As of September 30, 2021, we had total assets of $385,044, compared with total assets of $18,092 at September 30, 2020. The increase in total assets was primarily due to increase in prepayment and investment in Hukui.
We had $105,346 in total current liabilities as of September 30, 2021, consisting of $100,746 in accounts payable, $1,590 in accrued expenses, and $3,010 due to related parties. This is compared to total current liabilities of $371,035 as of September 30, 2020, which included $129,154 in accounts payable, $25,436 in accrued expenses, $96,035 due to related parties and $120,410 in notes payable - related party. The decrease of liability was because of decrease in due to related parties which was primarily due to some unpaid compensation to officers and directors. The liability was mainly paid off in the form of conversion of accrued compensation into shares of our Common Stock. Effective March 31, 2021, we issued an aggregate 6,399,965 shares of our Common Stock to certain of our directors, officers, employees and a consultant, who converted accrued and unpaid compensation in the aggregate amount of $94,398. Of this amount, (i) $37,998 was with respect to amounts accrued during fiscal year 2020 and was converted at a rate of $0.05 per share into an aggregate 759,965 shares of our Common Stock; and (ii) $56,400 was with respect to amount accrued during fiscal year 2021 through March 31, 2021 and was converted at a rate of $0.01 per share into an aggregate 5,640,000 shares of our Common Stock. Effective September 30, 2021, the Company issued an aggregate 6,144,000 shares of its Common Stock to certain of its directors, officers, employees and a consultant, who converted accrued and unpaid compensation in the aggregate amount of $61,440 at a rate of $0.01 per share of its Common Stock.
During the year ended September 30, 2021, one of our shareholders made the October 2020 Loan to us in the principal amount of $30,000, primarily to pay our expenses. The October 2020 Loan bore simple interest at a rate of 4% per annum and was payable as to both principal and interest on the Maturity Date of April 9, 2021. On the Maturity Date, the holder of the note evidencing the October 2020 Loan(the “October 2020 Note”) converted the outstanding principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest of $598, into 3,059,836 shares of the Company’s Common Stock at the rate of $0.01 per share.
We had total stockholders’ equity of $253,473 and an accumulated deficit of $9,522,821 as of September 30, 2021. In comparison, we had a total stockholders’ deficiency of $352,943 and an accumulated deficit of $8,158,389 as of September 30, 2020
On December 15, 2020, we completed the Fall 2020 Offering. We sold 107,000,000 shares of our Common Stock to 34 individuals at a purchase price of $0.01 per share, for gross proceeds of $1,070,000 before allocating certain expenses associated with the offering in the amount of $5,852 as adjusted paid-in capital.
On April 9, 2021, we issued 3,059,836 shares of our Common Stock to repay the principal and interest accrued upon the maturity of the October 2020 Note.
On June 15, 2021, we sold and issued 63,000,000 shares of our Common Stock to 18 individuals at purchase price of $0.01 per share in the Spring 2021 Offering. Gross proceeds were $630,000, before allocating certain expenses associated with the offering in the amount of $7,230 as adjusted paid-in capital.
On July 15, 2021, the Company completed the Spring 2021 Offering of its Common Stock, on which date it sold and issued additional 10,000,000 shares of its Common Stock to five individuals at a purchase price of $0.01 per share, for gross proceeds of $100,000, before allocating certain expenses associated with the offering in the amount of $959 as adjusted paid-in-capital.
Reverse Stock Split
On June 23, 2020, our Board of Directors approved the Reverse Stock Split of our Common Stock, at a ratio of 1-for-100, as of the Effective Date. The Effective Date of the Reverse Stock Split with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada was 9:00 a.m. on July 6, 2020 and July 23, 2020 with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and in the marketplace.
On the Effective Date, the total number of shares of our Common Stock held by each shareholder was converted automatically into the number of whole shares of Common Stock equal to (i) the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock held by such shareholder immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split, divided by (ii) 100.
No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split, and no cash or other consideration was be paid. Instead, we issued one whole share of the post-Reverse Stock Split Common Stock to any shareholder who otherwise would have received a fractional share as a result of the Reverse Stock Split.
We are authorized to issue 10,000,000,000 shares of Common Stock and that number did not change as a result of the Reverse Stock Split.
Cash Flows
During the year ended September 30, 2021, we used $304,588 of cash in operating activities which was attributable primarily to our net loss of $1,364,432 offset by impairment of $1,050,000 to investment and change in operating assets and liabilities of $9,844. In comparison, during the year ended September 30, 2020, we used $223,974 of cash in operating activities which was attributable to our net loss of $311,109 and the change in operating assets and liabilities of $87,135.
With respect to our investing activities, we used $1,400,000 in payment for investment made to Hukui during the year ended September 30, 2021. We did not have cash inflow from investing activities for the year ended September 30, 2020.
During the year ended September 30, 2021, we had total cash inflow of $1,695,549 from financing activities. We received $30,000 from the October 2020 Loan. We repaid $120,410 to the notes from related party, who was our then President and Chief Executive Officer, Jui Pin Lin. We received $1,785,959, net of directly associated expenses, including legal, transfer agent, and printing and delivery expenses, from two private offerings of our Common Stock, which were completed in December 2020 and July 2021, respectively. For accounting purpose, we recorded the net proceeds from private offering instead of the gross amount of $1,800,000.
During the year ended September 30, 2020, we received $120,410 from notes payable - related party. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jui Pin Lin, loaned us the aggregate principal amount of $120,410, primarily to pay our expenses. In October 2020, another shareholder loaned us the aggregate principal amount of $30,000, primarily to pay our expenses.
There is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our expenses as they become due. We do not anticipate any significant additional revenue until and unless we begin to execute on our plan of operations involving the start of our new nasal spray business. There is no assurance that we will ever reach that stage. The consolidated financial statements presented herein do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that we cannot continue as a going concern.
Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to successfully execute our business plan and generate profitable operations in the future, and, until and unless we achieve that, to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operation as and when they become due. Management intends to finance operating costs for the foreseeable future with the issuance of equity and/or debt. While we have received certain loans from our former President and Chief Executive Officer, Jui Pin (John) Lin, there is no standing commitment from any person for any such capital and there can be no assurances that capital will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our failure to obtain adequate funding would be detrimental to us and result in the inability to execute our plan of operations, or even having to cease operations completely.
To date, our capital requirements have primarily been funded by shareholders through the purchase of our Common Stock in private offerings and short-term borrowings from a former officer and another shareholder. We likely will need to raise additional capital for corporate expenses during the next 12 months. We are exploring options of raising additional capital through issuing more Common Stock or other securities, including debt and debt convertible into Common Stock. There are no agreements, arrangements or understandings in place with respect to raising any additional capital from any person. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such capital when and as needed on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.
Contractual Obligations
We do not have material contractual obligations and commitments. We only have one lease that is renewed on a month-to-month basis.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any other financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as shareholder’s equity or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.
Critical accounting policies and estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, recovery of long-lived assets, income taxes, and the valuation of equity transactions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, no significant estimates and assumptions have been made in the consolidated financial statements. The following are some of the critical accounting policies in relation to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. For a full summary of our critical accounting policies, please refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Foreign currency translation
The financial statements of our subsidiary denominated in currencies other than the USD are translated into USD using the closing rate method. The balance sheet items are translated into USD using the exchange rates at the respective balance sheet dates. The capital and various reserves are translated at historical exchange rates prevailing at the time of the transactions while income and expenses items are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. All exchange differences are recorded in stockholders’ equity (deficiency).
Stock-Based Compensation
We account for stock-based compensation in which we obtain employee services in share-based payment transactions under FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, which requires us to expense the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of such instruments over the vesting period.
We also adopted FASB ASC Topic 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees, to account for equity instruments issued to parties other than employees for acquiring goods or services. Such awards for services are recorded at either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the instruments issued in exchange for such services, whichever is more reliably measurable.
Recent accounting pronouncements
We do not expect that the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. For a full summary of recent accounting pronouncements, please refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Currency exchange rates
Our functional currency is the USD, and the functional currency of our operations is the TWD. It is anticipated that all of our sales will be denominated in TWD. As a result, changes in the relative values of USD and TWD affect our reported amounts of revenues and profit (or loss) as the results of our operations are translated into USD for reporting purposes. In particular, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on our financial stability. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the USD and the TWD would also affect our gross and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses.
Our exposure to foreign exchange risk primarily relates to currency gains or losses resulting from timing differences between the signing of sales contracts and the settling of these contracts. Furthermore, we translate monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies into TWD, the functional currency of our operations. Our results of operations and cash flow are translated at average exchange rates during the period, and assets and liabilities are translated at the unified exchange rate at the end of the period. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in our statement of shareholders’ equity. We have not used any forward contracts, currency options or borrowings to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. We cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations and may incur net foreign currency losses in the future.
To the extent that we hold assets denominated in USD, any appreciation of the TWD against the USD could result in a charge in our statement of operations and a reduction in the value of our USD-denominated assets. On the other hand, a decline in the value of the TWD against the USD could reduce the USD equivalent amounts of our financial results.
For financial reporting purposes, the financial statements of the Company’s Singapore subsidiary, which are prepared using the SGD, are translated into the Company’s reporting currency, USD. Assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date, which was 0.7368 and 0.7325 as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Revenue and expenses are translated using average exchange rates prevailing during each reporting period. The 0.7458 and 0.7228 average exchange rates were used to translate revenues and expenses for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Stockholders’ equity (deficiency) is translated at historical exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity (deficiency).
