ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing in this Annual Report. In addition to historical information, some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. See "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"
Company Overview
We are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of products for patients treated by ear, nose and throat (ENT) and allergy specialists. Our first commercial product, XHANCE® (fluticasone propionate) nasal spray, 93 micrograms (mcg), is a therapeutic utilizing our proprietary Exhalation Delivery System (EDS) that delivers a topically-acting corticosteroid for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and, if approved, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (also known as chronic sinusitis). Chronic rhinosinusitis is a serious nasal inflammatory disease that is treated using therapies, such as intranasal steroids (INS), which have significant limitations. We believe XHANCE has a differentiated clinical profile with the potential to become part of the standard of care for this disease because it is able to deliver medication to the primary site of inflammation high and deep in the nasal passages in regions not adequately reached by conventional INS.
In September 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved XHANCE for the treatment of nasal polyps in patients 18 years of age or older. XHANCE was made widely available through commercial channels in April 2018.
We have initiated two Phase 3b clinical trials of XHANCE for a follow-on indication for the treatment of chronic sinusitis. Positive top-line results from the first trial were announced in March 2022 and results from the second trial are expected in the second quarter of 2022. If both trials are positive, XHANCE has the potential to be the first drug therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of chronic sinusitis.
Business Updates in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused business and economic disruption, and the duration and impact of that disruption is uncertain at this time.
•In mid-March 2020, we transitioned to a full-time, virtual work environment in which all employees, including sales representatives (whom we refer to as territory managers), were encouraged to work from their place of residence. Our decision was based on actions taken by federal, state and local governments to contain the spread of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the related Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as the impact of “social distancing” efforts and various mitigation actions implemented by healthcare practices across the United States.
•Federal, state and local government requirements and guidances have impacted virtually all of the physicians' offices in which our territory managers detail XHANCE. These impacts include reduced patient visits, temporary halt of territory managers' visits, and temporary closings of physicians' offices. Shortly after our transition to a full-time, virtual work environment, our territory managers began virtual details of XHANCE to target audience physicians.
•We have been monitoring, and will continue to monitor, federal, state, and local government requirements and guidances. In certain instances, the various mitigation efforts have been updated to facilitate a return to a working environment with fewer restrictions. Where permitted by governmental requirements and the policies of physician offices, our territory managers began to return to in-person detailing of physicians in May and June 2020. Given the localized nature of the restrictions that are in place and the potential for restrictions to return, we have equipped our territory managers to operate in an environment that will include a mix of virtual and in-person physician detailing with dependencies on geography and time.
•Late in the first quarter of 2020 we began to observe an adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on XHANCE prescription growth. This adverse impact was most pronounced during the "shelter-in-place" mitigation efforts that were prevalent from late-March through May 2020. Although XHANCE prescription growth (and in particular, new prescription growth) continues to be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the magnitude of the impact has slowly improved as federal, state and local government requirements and guidances have been updated to facilitate economic reopening. Based on third-party prescription data as well as data from Preferred Pharmacy Network (PPN) partners, XHANCE prescriptions increased 11% from first quarter 2020 to second quarter 2020, 11% from second quarter 2020 to third quarter 2020, 7% from third quarter 2020 to fourth quarter 2020, decreased 2% from fourth quarter 2020 to first quarter 2021, increased 14% from first quarter 2021 to second quarter 2021, increased 4% from second quarter 2021 to third quarter 2021, and increased 8% from third quarter 2021 to fourth quarter 2021. Although XHANCE prescriptions have grown since the start of the pandemic, the rate of growth was below our pre-pandemic expectations. The duration and magnitude of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on XHANCE prescriptions and XHANCE net revenue remains uncertain and it has and could in the future continue to affect our ability to remain in compliance with our financial covenants under that certain Note Purchase Agreement dated as of September 12, 2019, as amended pursuant to that certain letter agreement dated as of August 13, 2020, as further amended by that certain First Amendment to Note Purchase Agreement dated as of March 2, 2021 (the Note Purchase Agreement), and as further amended pursuant to that certain Second Amendment to Note Purchase Agreement dated as of November 16, 2021, that we entered into with funds managed by Pharmakon Advisors, LP (Pharmakon), the investment manager of the BioPharma Credit Funds (BioPharma).
•Due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, one of our contract manufacturers implemented a reduced work schedule and additional precautions which resulted in delays in the manufacture of XHANCE in second quarter 2020 but did not result in an interruption to commercial or clinical supply. We believe we are maintaining appropriate levels of finished product inventories in the event of future supply disruption; however, the duration and magnitude of a future negative impact from the COVID-19 pandemic could constrain our supply of XHANCE.
•We completed enrollment in the first of our ongoing chronic sinusitis clinical trials in July 2021 and positive top-line results were announced earlier in March 2022. We completed enrollment of subjects in our second clinical trial for chronic sinusitis in October of 2021 and expect top-line results in the second quarter of 2022. For those subjects currently participating in the second clinical trial, procedures to facilitate ongoing treatment and capture of data during periods of in-person care restrictions have been put in place. Pauses in patient enrollment due to factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic have had, and may continue to have, varying effects in different geographies and over time have led to a change in our projected timeline for initial data availability and may lead to additional changes in the future.
The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is still unknown. It is likely to continue to have adverse impacts on XHANCE prescription growth and net revenues as a result of fewer patients visiting physician offices, restrictions imposed by some physician offices relating to territory managers' visits, increased unemployment adversely affecting demand and payor mix, and the availability and cost of capital for us to fund our business operations and service our debt. We will continue to assess the evolving impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and will make adjustments to our operations as necessary.
Additional Business Updates
We track and report metrics that we believe are an important part of assessing our progress in key strategic areas including:
•XHANCE Prescriptions and Market Share. Based on third-party prescription data as well as data from PPN partners, the total estimated number of XHANCE prescriptions in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 93,700, which represents 27% growth for prescriptions when compared to estimated fourth quarter 2020 prescriptions of 73,900. The INS prescription market increased approximately 6% from fourth quarter 2020 to fourth quarter 2021 based on third-party prescription data. In addition, the total estimated number of XHANCE prescriptions was 72,600 in the first quarter of 2021, 82,900 in the second quarter of 2021, and 86,300 in the third quarter of 2021.
A seasonal effect has historically been observed in the INS prescription market in which market volume generally peaks near the middle of the second quarter and declines into the early part of the third quarter of each calendar year. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, INS prescription market volumes did not experience the expected peak in the second quarter of 2020. Based on third-party prescription data, INS market prescriptions increased 8% from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2020, decreased 16% from the first quarter of 2020 to the second quarter of 2020, decreased 6% from the second quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2020, increased 2% from the third quarter of 2020 to the fourth quarter of 2020, decreased 4% from fourth quarter 2020 to the first quarter of 2021, increased 14% from the first quarter of 2021 to the second quarter of 2021, decreased 4% from the second quarter of 2021 to the third quarter of 2021, and increased 1% from the third quarter 2021 to the fourth quarter 2021. In addition, based on third-party prescription data, INS market prescriptions were flat from full year 2018 to full year 2019, and decreased 7% from full year 2019 to full year 2020, and flat from full year 2020 to full year 2021.
Although the underlying disease that we are treating is chronic and causes symptoms year-round, we believe the variation in patient flow through the offices of relevant physician specialists, and seasonality in disease flare-ups, has an impact on the number of patients that present themselves and who are therefore available to receive a new prescription for XHANCE. Demand has historically been, and we expect will continue to be, impacted by the INS market seasonality and the seasonal variation in patient visits with their doctor resulting in reduced XHANCE prescription demand in the third quarter.
Additionally, as we experienced in 2020 and 2021, we expect that the first quarter prescription demand and average net revenue per prescription for XHANCE will be adversely impacted in 2022 and future years by the annual resetting of patient healthcare insurance plan deductibles and changes in individual patients' healthcare insurance coverage, both of which often occur in January.
We track the market share of XHANCE within our current target audience. For this purpose, we calculate market share as the proportion of XHANCE prescriptions to the number of prescriptions written for other INS within our current target audience of approximately 18,000 physicians. Our target physician audience includes all ENT and Allergy specialist physicians who, based on third-party data, write intranasal steroid spray prescriptions. In addition, our current target audience includes specialty-like primary care physicians called on by our territory managers or kaléo sales representatives.
We believe market share, in addition to XHANCE prescription volume, provides important information regarding XHANCE utilization because market share normalizes XHANCE prescriptions for market effects including the INS market seasonality, seasonal variation in patient visits with their doctor, annual deductible resets and annual changes in individual patient's healthcare insurance coverage referenced above. Based on third-party prescription data as well as data from PPN partners, we estimate XHANCE had a market share in our current target audience of 18,000 physicians of 5.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020, 5.4% in the first quarter of 2021, 5.4% in the second quarter of 2021, 6.0% in the third quarter of 2021, and 6.3% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Note that most of the INS prescriptions written within our target physician audience are for chronic sinusitis, allergic rhinitis and other conditions outside of our nasal polyp indication. Our target physician audience is subject to revision each quarter to account for changes such as revised sales target prioritization, and physician retirements. Changes to the target physician audience can contribute some of the quarter over quarter change in market share.
•XHANCE New Prescriptions and Refill Prescriptions. The underlying disease that we are treating is chronic and, as a result, many patients may fill multiple prescriptions per year. We monitor new prescriptions as they create the potential for future refill prescriptions. Based on third-party prescription data as well as data from PPN partners, the total estimated number of XHANCE new prescriptions in the fourth quarter of 2021
was 29,900, which represents 21% growth for new prescriptions when compared to estimated fourth quarter 2020 new prescriptions of 24,600. In addition, the total estimated number of XHANCE new prescriptions was 25,900 in first quarter 2021, 29,000 in second quarter 2021, and 27,900 in third quarter 2021. Based on third-party prescription data, the INS market for new prescriptions increased 14% from the fourth quarter of 2020 to the fourth quarter of 2021 and increased 2% from the third quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2021. In addition, based on third-party prescription data, the INS market for new prescriptions increased 1% from full year 2018 to full year 2019, decreased 13% from full year 2019 to full year 2020, and increased 4% from full year 2020 to full year 2021.
We track refill prescriptions and provide patient assistance to support refill programs that are administered by our PPN partners. Based on third-party prescription data as well as data from PPN partners, the total estimated number of XHANCE refill prescriptions in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 63,800, which represents 30% growth for refill prescriptions when compared to estimated fourth quarter 2020 refill prescriptions of 49,300. In addition, the total estimated number of XHANCE refill prescriptions was 46,700 in first quarter 2021, 53,900 in second quarter 2021, and 58,400 in third quarter 2021.
•Prescribing Breadth and Depth. We track the number of physicians who prescribe XHANCE in a time period to evaluate the breadth of prescribing. Based on third-party prescription data as well as data from PPN partners, the total estimated number of physicians who had at least one patient fill a prescription for XHANCE in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 7,532, which represents 12% growth when compared to the estimated 6,708 physicians who had at least one patient fill a prescription for XHANCE in the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition, the total estimated number of physicians who had at least one patient fill a prescription for XHANCE was 6,920 in the first quarter of 2021, 7,188 in the second quarter of 2021, and 7,196 in the third quarter of 2021.
We also track the number of prescriptions filled by a prescribing physician's patients in a time period to evaluate depth of prescribing. Based on third-party prescription data as well as data from PPN partners, the total estimated number of physicians who had more than 15 XHANCE prescriptions filled by their patients in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 1,589, which represents 25% growth when compared to the estimated 1,275 physicians who had more than 15 XHANCE prescriptions filled by their patients in the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition, the total estimated number of physicians who had more than 15 XHANCE prescriptions filled by their patients was 1,285 in the first quarter of 2021, 1,414 in the second quarter of 2021, and 1,459 in the third quarter of 2021.
•XHANCE Net Product Revenues per Prescription. We calculate average net product revenues per prescription, one metric that we use to gauge the profitability of XHANCE, by dividing net product revenues for the quarter by the estimated number of XHANCE prescriptions dispensed during the quarter. Average XHANCE net product revenues per prescription were $240 in the fourth quarter of 2021 which represents an approximately 14% increase when compared to the $211 average XHANCE net product revenues per prescription in the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition, average XHANCE net revenues per prescription were $151 in the first quarter of 2021, $221 in the second quarter of 2021, and $253 in the third quarter of 2021.
Financial Operations Overview
The following discussion sets forth certain components of our consolidated statements of operations as well as factors that impact those items.
Net product revenues
Sales of XHANCE generated $73.7 million and $48.4 million in net product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In accordance with GAAP, we determine net product revenues for XHANCE, with specific assumptions for variable consideration components including but not limited to trade discounts and allowances, co-pay assistance programs and payor rebates.
Based on available XHANCE prescription data purchased from third parties and data from our PPN partners, our average net product revenue per prescription for the fourth quarter of 2021 was approximately $240, which represents a 14% increase compared to our average net product revenue per prescription of approximately $211 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Average net product revenue per prescription for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $219, which represents an 18% increase compared to our average net product revenue per prescription of approximately $185 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
We calculate average net product revenues per prescription, one metric that we use to gauge the profitability of XHANCE, by dividing net product revenues for the quarter by the estimated number of XHANCE prescriptions dispensed during the quarter. As a result, average net product revenues per prescription is subject to variability. That variability is impacted by factors that do not necessarily reflect a change in the price that is paid for an individual unit of XHANCE, including but not limited to ordering patterns and inventory levels for our wholesale customers and PPN partners, patient utilization rates of affordability programs and the proportion of patients acquiring XHANCE through an insurance benefit. There is also the potential for variability that results from changes in estimation methodology by the third parties that we rely upon to provide prescription data which may lead to revisions of historical estimates of prescription volumes and our calculated average net product revenues per prescription.
We expect full year 2022 net product revenues to be at least $90.0 million. This includes our expectation that first quarter 2022 net product revenues will decrease compared to fourth quarter 2021. The primary driver of the sequential decrease to net product revenues is our expectation of a decrease in XHANCE average net product revenues per prescription for the first quarter of 2022. This expected decrease from the fourth quarter 2021 is largely a consequence of the reset of many patient insurance deductibles in January. As a result of this annual reset, we expect greater copay support to be provided by us under our assistance programs. In addition, we believe another contributor to the expected first quarter 2022 decrease is related to changes in patients' healthcare insurance coverage that reduce demand for refill prescriptions early in the year. This reduction in refill prescriptions also has the effect of lowering average net product revenues per prescription as it reduces the proportion of prescriptions that are covered (reimbursed) by a commercial insurer, which results in us providing greater copay support under our assistance programs. For the full year 2022, we believe XHANCE net product revenues per prescription will be greater than $210.
Licensing revenues
In September 2019, OptiNose AS, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into the Currax License Agreement. Under the terms of the Currax License Agreement, Currax paid us a $3.7 million upfront payment in 2019 and an additional $0.8 million in December 2020 upon expiration of the escrow that was established for a limited period to cover potential indemnification obligations. In January 2021, a specified regulatory milestone was met and the Company received a $1.0 million milestone payment. We do not expect to receive any further payments from Currax under the terms of the License Agreement other than reimbursement for certain expenses.
In January 2019, OptiNose AS entered into a licensing agreement with Inexia Limited (The Centessa License Agreement). In February 2021, Inexia merged into Orexia therapeutics, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Centessa Pharmaceuticals (Centessa), a novel asset-centric pharmaceutical company. Under the terms of the Centessa License Agreement, Centessa paid us a $0.5 million upfront payment. For each product developed under the Centessa License Agreement, we are eligible to receive up to $8.0 million of development milestone payments and up to $37.0 million of sales milestone payments. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered, low-to-mid single digit royalties based on net sales of any products successfully developed and commercialized under the Centessa License Agreement. Other than the upfront payment, we do not anticipate the receipt of any milestone or royalty payments from Centessa in the near term.
Costs of product sales
Costs of product sales includes the cost of inventory sold, which includes direct and indirect manufacturing and supply chain costs.
Research and development expense
Research and development expense consists primarily of expenses incurred to prepare for, initiate and conduct our planned clinical trials, ongoing research efforts of new products and device improvements. We expense research and development costs as incurred. These expenses include:
▪personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense;
▪costs of funding clinical development performed by third parties, including pursuant to agreements with contract research organizations (CROs), as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct or support our nonclinical studies and clinical trials;
▪expenses associated with the continued development of our EDS devices;
▪expenses related to the continued development of our product sample portfolio;
▪expenses incurred under agreements with contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), including manufacturing scale-up expenses prior to regulatory approval of products for commercial sale and the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials;
▪consultant fees and expenses associated with outsourced professional scientific development services;
▪expenses for regulatory activities, including filing fees paid to regulatory agencies and costs incurred to compile and respond to filings with the FDA prior to regulatory approval of products for commercial sale; and
▪allocated expenses for facility costs, including rent, utilities, depreciation and maintenance.
We typically use our employee, consultant and infrastructure resources across our research and development programs. Although we track certain outsourced development costs by product candidate, we do not allocate personnel costs or other internal costs to specific product candidates.
We plan to continue to incur significant research and development expenses in 2022 as we complete ongoing chronic sinusitis trials and, subject to positive data in ReOpen2, prepare for and submit an NDA to the FDA. At this time, due to the inherently unpredictable nature of clinical development and the regulatory approval process, we are unable to estimate with reasonable certainty the costs we will incur and the timelines we will require in our continued development efforts. Assuming we do not need to conduct additional studies to support an FDA approval of XHANCE for the treatment of chronic sinusitis and we do not undertake new development programs, we expect significantly lower research and development expenses beginning in 2023.
Selling, general and administrative expense
General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, for employees in executive, finance, accounting, business development, information technology, legal and human resource functions. General and administrative expense also includes corporate facility costs, including rent, utilities, depreciation and maintenance, not otherwise included in research and development expense, as well as regulatory fees and professional fees for legal, patent, accounting and other consulting services.
Sales and marketing expenses include our sales team and supporting promotional materials, digital promotion, peer-to-peer education, congresses / conventions, samples, and marketing activities such as direct-to-patient / direct-to-consumer initiatives. Additionally, sales and marketing-related expenses include fees paid to our PPN partners for services unrelated to traditional distribution functions, such as data fees and benefit claims adjudication.
Interest (income) expense
Interest (income) expense consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents held with institutional banks and interest expense is primarily related to our note purchase agreement (Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes) with Pharmakon Advisors, LP (Pharmakon).
Other (income) expense
Other (income) expense consists of foreign currency (income) losses due to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than our functional currency as well as grant income and gains on sale of property and equipment.
Critical accounting policies and use of estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reported period.
We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue recognition
We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which was adopted on January 1, 2018. We perform the following five steps to recognize revenue under ASC Topic 606: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only recognize revenue when it is probable that we will collect the consideration to which we are entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer.
Net product revenues
We recognize XHANCE revenue at the point the customer obtains control of the product, which generally occurs upon delivery. The transaction price that is recognized as revenue for products includes an estimate of variable consideration. Payment terms with customers do not exceed one year and, therefore, we do not account for a financing component in our arrangements. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer (for example, sales commissions) are expensed when incurred as the period of benefit is less than one year. Shipping and handling costs for product shipments to customers are recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available. As of December 31, 2021, we did not make any material adjustment to our prior estimates of variable consideration. Further, we believe that reasonable variations in our estimates of variable consideration would not result in material changes to our financial statements. The components of our variable consideration include the following:
Provider Chargebacks and Discounts. Chargebacks for fees and discounts to providers represent the estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at prices lower than the list prices charged to customers who directly purchase the product from us. Customers charge us for the difference between what they pay for the product and the ultimate selling price to the qualified healthcare providers. These components of variable consideration are established in the same period that the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and accounts receivable. Our provision for chargebacks and discounts consists of our estimates for these credits, which we evaluate based on historical data, estimated future trends, and estimates of inventory held by our customers.
Trade Discounts and Allowances. We generally provide customers with discounts that include incentive fees which are explicitly stated in the Company’s contracts. These discounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue and accounts receivable in the period in which the related product revenue is recognized.
Product Returns. Consistent with industry practice, we have a product returns policy that provides customers a right of return for product purchased within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the product’s expiration date. We estimate the amount of our product that may be returned and present this amount as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized, in addition to establishing a current liability. We consider several factors in the estimation process, including expiration dates of product shipped to customers, inventory levels within the distribution channel, product shelf life, prescription trends and other relevant factors.
Government Rebates. We are subject to discount obligations under state Medicaid programs and Medicare. Reserves related to these discount obligations are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability. Our liability for these rebates consists of estimates of claims for the current quarter and estimated future claims that will be made for product that has been recognized as revenue but remains in the distribution channel inventories at the end of the reporting period.
Payor Rebates. We contract with certain third-party payors, primarily health insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers, for the payment of rebates with respect to utilization of its products. These rebates are based on contractual percentages applied to the amount of product prescribed to patients who are covered by the plan or the organization with which it contracts. We estimate these rebates and record such estimates in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability.
Patient Assistance. Other programs that we offer include voluntary co-pay patient assistance programs intended to provide financial assistance to eligible patients with prescription drug co-payments required by payors and coupon programs for cash payors. The calculation of the current liability for this assistance is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that we expect to receive associated with product that has been recognized as revenue but remains in the distribution channel inventories at the end of each reporting period.
Distribution and Other Fees. We pay distribution and other fees to certain customers in connection with the sales of our products. We record distribution and other fees paid to our customers as a reduction of revenue, unless the payment is for a distinct good or service from the customer and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the goods or services received. If both conditions are met, we record the consideration paid to the customer as an operating expense. These costs are typically known at the time of sale, resulting in minimal adjustments subsequent to the period of sale.
Stock-based compensation
We account for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (ASC 718). ASC 718 requires all stock-based compensation awards to employees to be recognized as expense based on their grant date fair values. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock option and restricted stock option awards and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan. Restricted stock units are valued at the fair market value per share of our common stock on the date of grant. We account for forfeitures of stock option awards as they occur. For awards issued to employees, we recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. The resulting increase or decrease in value, if any, is recognized as expense or a reduction to expense, respectively, during the period the related services are rendered. Expense for awards with performance conditions is estimated and adjusted on a quarterly basis based upon our assessment of the probability that the performance condition will be met. In January 2022, we issued awards with vesting subject to specific market conditions. The calculation of the value of awards that are subject to market conditions, as well as the derived service period for these awards, will be determined using a Monte Carlo simulation. Stock based compensation for awards that are subject to a market condition will be recognized based on the derived service period..
Estimating the fair value of stock option awards and shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the estimated fair value of our common stock, the expected life of the option, stock price volatility, the risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. The assumptions used in our Black-Scholes option-pricing model represent management's best estimates and involve a number of variables, uncertainties and assumptions and the application of management's judgment, as they are inherently subjective. If any assumptions change, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.
These assumptions used in our Black-Scholes option-pricing model are estimated as follows:
•Expected Term. Due to the lack of sufficient company-specific historical data, the expected term of employee options is determined using the "simplified" method, as prescribed in SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, whereby the expected life equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The expected term of non-employee options is equal to the contractual term.
•Expected Volatility. The expected volatility is based on historical volatilities of similar entities within our industry which were commensurate with the expected term assumption as described in SAB No. 107.
•Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the interest rate payable on U.S. Treasury securities in effect at the time of grant for a period that is commensurate with the assumed expected term.
•Expected Dividends. The expected dividend yield is 0% because we have not historically paid, and do not expect for the foreseeable future to pay, a dividend on our common stock.
The following table reflects the weighted average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock option awards granted and shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan during the year ended December 31, 2021.
(1) Includes options and RSUs granted outside the 2010 A&R Stock Incentive Plan. The grants were made pursuant to the Nasdaq inducement grant exception in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4).

See Note 3 of our audited consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our consolidated financial statements.
JOBS Act
The JOBS Act permits an “emerging growth company”, such as us, to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to “opt out” of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards when they are required to be adopted by public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
Consolidated Results of Operations
Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table sets forth our selected consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated (in thousands):
Net product revenues
Net product revenues related to sales of XHANCE were $73.7 million and $48.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Revenue growth was attributable primarily to:
•an increase in average net product revenue per prescription in 2021; and
•an increase in units sold to customers, as a result of a greater number of XHANCE prescriptions dispensed during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Licensing revenues
Licensing revenues were $1.0 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as a result of payments received under the terms of the Currax License Agreement entered into in September 2019.
Cost of product sales
Cost of product sales related to XHANCE were $9.2 million and $7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, with the increase attributable primarily to an increase in units sold to customers, the result of a greater number of XHANCE prescriptions dispensed during the period.
Research and development expense
Research and development expenses were $25.3 million and $23.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The $1.9 million increase in 2021 was attributable primarily to:
▪a $3.3 million increase in clinical expenses related to our clinical trial program in pursuit of a follow-on indication for XHANCE for the treatment of chronic sinusitis in adults in the U.S. and the FDA-mandated post-marketing pediatric study; and
This increase was offset by:
▪a $1.0 million decrease in device and product development costs, including OPN-019; and
▪a $0.4 million decrease in personnel expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expense
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $106.6 million and $105.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The $1.2 million increase was due primarily to:
•a $1.8 million increase in service fees paid to our PPN partners;
▪a $0.9 million increase in marketing costs;
▪a $0.4 million increase in professional and insurance fees;
This increase was offset by:
▪a $1.5 million decrease in personnel expenses; and
▪a $0.5 million decrease in medical affairs administration expenses, primarily educational grants.
Interest (income) expense, net
Interest expense, net, was $15.9 million and $12.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which was primarily comprised of interest expense on the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes during both periods. The increase was primarily related to increased principal balance of the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes as well as a decrease in interest income earned on cash deposits.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since inception, we have incurred significant net losses and expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. We incurred net losses of $82.3 million and $99.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $610.1 million. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of stock and the issuance of debt, as well as through licensing revenues received under the terms of our license agreements and revenues from sales of XHANCE. As of December 31, 2021, we had $110.5 million in cash and cash equivalents.
The following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):
Operating activities
Cash used in operating activities decreased by $9.3 million, from $86.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $76.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was attributable primarily to increased revenue offset by increased operating and interest expenses and the timing of payment of those expenses.
Investing activities
Cash used in investing activities decreased by $0.4 million from $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was attributable to a decrease in purchases of property plant and equipment of $0.4 million.
Financing activities
Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, was driven primarily by net proceeds of $43.1 million from the issuance of shares of Company common stock as a result of a November 2021 underwritten public offering of 28,750,000 shares at a price of $1.60 per share.
Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, was driven primarily by net proceeds of $50.0 million from the issuance of the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes and net proceeds of $33.4 million as a result of an August 2020 underwritten public offering in which we sold 6,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $5.60 per share.
Senior Secured Note Purchase Agreement
On September 12, 2019 (the Closing Date), we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with funds managed by Pharmakon Advisors, LP (Pharmakon), the investment manager of BioPharma Credit Funds (BioPharma). The Note Purchase Agreement provided the Company with $130.0 million in debt financing, of which $80.0 million of Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes was issued on the Closing Date, $30.0 million was issued on February 13, 2020 after achieving the $9.0 million consolidated XHANCE net sales and royalties threshold for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 and $20.0 million was issued on December 1, 2020 after achieving the $14.5 million consolidated XHANCE net sales and royalties threshold for the quarter ended September 30, 2020.
In conjunction with the Note Purchase Agreement, we paid an upfront fee of $1.1 million on the Closing Date and issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 810,357 shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to $6.72 per share, which were set expire on September 12, 2022. The upfront fees were recorded as a debt discount at issuance and are being amortized to interest expense over the five-year term of the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes. We also incurred $5.0 million in debt issuance costs, including $2.4 million related to the fair value of the warrants, which were also being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes.
On August 13, 2020, we entered into a letter agreement (the Pharmakon Letter Agreement) to the Note Purchase Agreement. The Pharmakon Letter Agreement provided us with the option to issue additional Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes, subject to the Company achieving specified consolidated XHANCE net sales and royalties for the quarter ended June 30, 2021 and certain other conditions. As consideration for the Pharmakon Letter Agreement, the Company issued 44,643 shares of common stock to Pharmakon. The aggregate fair value of $0.3 million was recorded as debt issuance costs and is being amortized to interest expense over the five-year term of the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes. The Company was no longer eligible for the additional Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes as the requisite conditions were not satisfied as of June 30, 2021.
On March 2, 2021, we entered into the first amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement (the First Amendment). The First Amendment revised certain minimum trailing twelve-month consolidated XHANCE net sales and royalties we are required to achieve. As consideration for the First Amendment, we will pay an amendment fee of $1.3 million upon the earlier of the prepayment of the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes or the Maturity Date (defined below). The amendment fee was recorded as a debt issuance cost and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes.
On November 16, 2021, we entered into the second amendment (the Second Amendment) to the Note Purchase Agreement. The Second Amendment revised certain minimum trailing twelve-month consolidated XHANCE net sales and royalties we are required to achieve and amended the "make-whole" provision with respect to certain principal prepayments. Upon execution of the Second Amendment, the interest-only period of amounts due under the Note Purchase Agreement was extended from December 2022 to September 2023. Principal repayments will commence on September 15, 2023, with five equal quarterly installments of principal and interest through to the Maturity Date.
In conjunction with the Second Amendment, we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2,500,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.60 and fair value of $2.0 million. The warrants are set to expire on November 15, 2024. we cancelled previously issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 810,357 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6.72 with an expiration date of September 12, 2022.
We are required to repay the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes in full upon the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement). In addition, we may make voluntary prepayments in whole or in part. All mandatory and voluntary prepayments are subject to the payment of prepayment premiums as follows: (i) if prepayment occurs prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date, an amount equal to 2% of the principal prepaid, (ii) if prepayment occurs on or after the third anniversary of the Closing Date but prior to the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, an amount equal to 1% of the principal prepaid, and (iii) if prepayment occurs on or after the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, no prepayment premium is required. We are also required to pay a "make-whole" amount in respect of any principal prepayments (whether mandatory or voluntary) made prior to the 30-month anniversary of our November 18, 2021 financing, in an amount equal to the interest that would have accrued through the 30-month anniversary in respect of such note but for such principal prepayment, provided that in the case of any prepayment made prior to the 15-month anniversary, we will not be required to pay a "make-whole" amount in excess of an amount equal to the interest that would have accrued through the 15-month anniversary but for such principal prepayment.
The Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes are secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets and the Note Purchase Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type, including limitations on our and our subsidiaries’ ability, among other things, to incur additional debt, grant or permit additional liens, make investments and acquisitions, merge or consolidate with others, dispose of assets, pay dividends and distributions, repay junior indebtedness and enter into affiliate transactions, in each case, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, the Note Purchase Agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain at all times certain minimum trailing twelve-month consolidated XHANCE net sales and royalties, tested on a quarterly basis, as follows (in millions):
In addition, we are required to maintain at all times at least $30.0 million of cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenants. The Note Purchase Agreement also includes
events of default customary for financings of this type, in certain cases subject to customary periods to cure, following which BioPharma may accelerate all amounts outstanding under the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes.
Projected 2022 operating expenses
We expect that our total GAAP operating expenses (consisting of selling, general & administrative expenses and research & development expenses) for 2022 will be between $135.0 million and $140.0 million of which approximately $10.0 million is expected to be stock-based compensation expense. As a result, total GAAP operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation expense are expected to be between $125.0 million and $130.0 million. An increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses from 2021 to 2022 is anticipated primarily due to inflation and an increase in fees paid to our PPN partners associated with higher projected XHANCE prescription volumes which is offset by an expected decrease in research and development expenses as our clinical trial program in pursuit of a follow-on indication for XHANCE for the treatment of chronic sinusitis nears completion.
Future funding requirements
We expect to continue to incur significant expenses in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we:
▪continue advertising and other promotional activities to support the commercialization of XHANCE;
▪continue to provide co-pay and other patient affordability programs;
▪continue clinical development activities for XHANCE, including an FDA-mandated post-marketing pediatric study and clinical trials for a follow-on indication for the treatment of chronic sinusitis;
▪continue research and development activities for additional product candidates;
▪continue to contract to manufacture XHANCE and our other product candidates;
▪maintain, expand and protect our patent portfolio;
▪service our debt obligations under the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes;
▪maintain infrastructure necessary to operate as a publicly-traded, commercial-stage company; and
▪hire additional staff and add operational, financial and information systems to execute our business plan.
Our future funding requirements, both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:
▪the duration and impact of COVID-19 restrictions on our business;
▪the success of our commercialization of XHANCE for the treatment of nasal polyps including, among other things, patient and physician acceptance of XHANCE and our ability to maintain adequate insurance coverage and reimbursement for XHANCE;
▪the cost of commercialization activities for XHANCE, including product manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sales;
▪net product revenues received from sales of XHANCE;
▪the level of co-pay assistance and other patient affordability programs offered for XHANCE;
▪our clinical development plans for XHANCE, including the outcome, timing and cost of an FDA-mandated post-marketing pediatric study and clinical trials for the supplemental indication for the treatment of chronic sinusitis;
▪the outcome, timing and cost of the regulatory approval process of XHANCE for chronic sinusitis by the FDA, including the potential for the FDA to require that we perform more studies and clinical trials than those that we currently expect;
▪the costs involved in preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and annuity fees relating to issued patents;
▪the cost of maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights, as well as the cost of defending intellectual property disputes, including patent infringement actions brought by third parties against us;
▪the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials and other research and development related to additional product candidates, and
▪the extent to which we in-license, acquire or otherwise partner in development or commercialization of other products, product candidates or technologies.
Although it is difficult to predict our future liquidity requirements, we will likely require additional capital in the future secured through equity or debt financings, partnerships, collaborations, or other sources in order to meet the debt service obligations under our outstanding Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes, including repayment, and to carry out our planned development and commercial activities. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to maintain the minimum cash balance required under our debt facility and to fund our operations for at least twelve months from the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. After such period, additional capital, secured in the future through equity or debt financings, partnerships, collaborations, or other sources, will be required, and may not be available on a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at all, and such capital, if raised, may not be sufficient to meet our debt service obligations, including repayment, or enable us to continue to implement our long-term business strategy. Commencing on September 15, 2023, we will be required begin making principal repayments on our debt in five quarterly installments of $26.0 million each through maturity in September 2024. If additional capital is not secured when required, we may need to delay or curtail our operations until such funding is received. If we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and we may need to delay or curtail our operations until such funding is received. Additionally, we may fail to satisfy our debt covenants, may never become profitable, or if we do, may not be able to sustain profitability on a recurring basis.
