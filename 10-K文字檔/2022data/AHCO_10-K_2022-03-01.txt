All amounts presented are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), except as noted. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from management’s expectations. Factors that could cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
AdaptHealth Corp. Overview
AdaptHealth is a national leader in providing patient-centered, healthcare-at-home solutions including home medical equipment (“HME”), medical supplies, and related services. The Company focuses primarily on providing (i) sleep therapy equipment, supplies and related services (including CPAP and bi PAP services) to individuals suffering from obstructive sleep apnea (“OSA”), (ii) medical devices and supplies to patients for the treatment of diabetes (including continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps), (iii) home medical equipment to patients discharged from acute care and other facilities, (iv) oxygen and related chronic therapy services in the home, and (v) other HME devices and supplies on behalf of chronically ill patients with wound care, urological, incontinence, ostomy and nutritional supply needs. The Company services beneficiaries of Medicare, Medicaid and commercial insurance payors. As of December 31, 2021, AdaptHealth serviced approximately 3.8 million patients annually in all 50 states through its network of 757 locations in 47 states. The Company’s principal executive offices are located at 220 West Germantown Pike, Suite 250, Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania 19462.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted AdaptHealth’s business, as well as its patients, communities, and employees. AdaptHealth’s priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic remain protecting the health and safety of its employees (including patient-facing employees providing respiratory and other services), maximizing the availability of its services and products to support patient health needs, and maintaining the operational and financial stability of its business.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the National Emergency Declaration, dated March 13, 2020, in the first quarter of 2020, AdaptHealth activated certain business interruption protocols, including acquisition and distribution of personal protective equipment (PPE) to its patient-facing employees, accelerated capital expenditures of certain products and relocation of significant portions of its workforce to “work-from-home” status. Federal, state, and local authorities have taken several actions designed to assist healthcare providers in providing care to COVID-19 and other patients and to mitigate the adverse economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Legislative actions taken by the federal government include the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), which was signed into law on March 27, 2020. Through the CARES Act, the federal government has authorized payments to be
distributed to healthcare providers through the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (“Provider Relief Fund” or “PRF”). Additionally, the CARES Act revised the Medicare accelerated and advance payment program in an attempt to disburse payments to healthcare providers more quickly to mitigate the financial impact on healthcare providers.
AdaptHealth increased its cash liquidity by, among other things, seeking recoupable advance payments of $45.8 million made available by CMS under the CARES Act legislation, which was received in April 2020. In addition, in connection with an acquisition completed in July 2020, AdaptHealth assumed a liability of $3.7 million relating to CMS recoupable advance payments received by the acquired company prior to the date of acquisition. The recoupment of the advance payments by CMS began in April 2021 and is being applied to services provided and revenue recognized during the period in which the recoupment occurs, and will impact AdaptHealth’s cash receipts for services provided until such time all amounts have been recouped. During the year ended December 31, 2021, CMS has recouped a total of $36.7 million. As of December 31, 2021, AdaptHealth has deferred a total of $12.8 million related to CMS recoupable advance payments, which is included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, in April 2020, AdaptHealth received distributions of the CARES Act PRF of $17.2 million. Subsequent to April 2020, AdaptHealth completed several acquisitions in which the acquired companies received a total of $22.2 million of PRF payments prior to the applicable dates of acquisition. In connection with the accounting for these acquisitions, AdaptHealth recorded assumed liabilities of $7.7 million relating to the PRF payments received by the acquired companies. The PRF payments are targeted to offset lost revenue and expenditures incurred in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. The PRF payments are subject to certain restrictions and are subject to recoupment if not used for designated purposes. As a condition to receiving distributions, providers were required to agree to certain terms and conditions, including, among other things, that the funds would be used for lost revenues and unreimbursed COVID-19 related expenses as defined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”). All recipients of PRF payments were required to comply with the reporting requirements described in the terms and conditions and as determined by HHS. AdaptHealth recognizes grant payments as income when there is reasonable assurance that it has complied with the conditions associated with the grant. During the fourth quarter of each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized grant income of $10.6 million and $14.3 million, respectively, related to the PRF payments determined to comply with conditions associated with the grant.
HHS has indicated that the CARES Act PRF are subject to ongoing reporting and changes to the terms and conditions, and there have been several updates to such reporting requirements and terms and conditions since they were issued by HHS. Such updates have related to changes to the guidance regarding utilization of the funds granted from the PRF and updates to the reporting requirements of such funds, among other updates. To the extent that there is any future updated guidance from HHS or modifications to the terms and conditions, it may affect AdaptHealth’s ability to comply and AdaptHealth could be required to reverse the recognition of the grant income recorded and return a portion of the funds received, which could be material to AdaptHealth. AdaptHealth is continuing to monitor the terms and conditions issued by HHS. Furthermore, HHS has indicated that it will be closely monitoring and, along with the Office of Inspector General (United States) (OIG), auditing providers to ensure that recipients comply with the terms and conditions of relief programs and to prevent fraud and abuse. All providers will be subject to civil and criminal penalties for any deliberate omissions, misrepresentations or falsifications of any information given to HHS.
Also, as permitted under the CARES Act, AdaptHealth elected to defer certain portions of employer-paid FICA taxes otherwise payable from March 27, 2020 to January 1, 2021. In total, AdaptHealth deferred $8.6 million under this provision. AdaptHealth paid $4.3 million on January 4, 2022 and the remaining balance of $4.3 million is expected to be paid shortly after December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2021, $4.3 million is included in other current liabilities and $4.3 million is included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the National Emergency Declaration and the various state and local government imposed stay-at-home restrictions did not have a material impact on AdaptHealth’s consolidated operating results initially, AdaptHealth has experienced declines in net revenue in certain services associated with elective medical procedures (such as commencement of new CPAP services and medical equipment and orthopedic supply related to facility discharges), and such declines may continue during the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Offsetting these declines in net revenue, AdaptHealth has experienced an increase in net revenue related to increased demand for certain respiratory products (such as oxygen), increased sales in its resupply businesses (primarily as a result
of the increased ability to contact patients at home as a result of state and local government imposed stay-at-home orders) and the one-time sale of certain respiratory equipment (primarily ventilators, bi-level PAP devices and oxygen concentrators) to hospitals and local health agencies. Additionally, the suspension of Medicare sequestration (resulting in an approximate 2% increase in Medicare payments to all providers through March 31, 2022 and a 1% increase from April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022 (when the suspension of Medicare sequestration ends), and regulatory guidance from CMS expanding telemedicine and reducing documentation requirements during the emergency period, have resulted in increased net revenues for certain products and services.
The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on AdaptHealth’s business, results of operations, and financial condition is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments and numerous evolving factors that it may not be able to accurately predict, and could be material to AdaptHealth’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods. For additional information on risk factors that could impact AdaptHealth’s results, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Key Components of Operating Results
Net Revenue. Net revenue is recorded for services that AdaptHealth provides to patients for home healthcare equipment, medical supplies to the home and related services. AdaptHealth’s primary service lines are (i) sleep therapy equipment, supplies and related services (including CPAP and bi PAP services) to individuals suffering from OSA, (ii) medical devices and supplies to patients for the treatment of diabetes (including continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps), (iii) home medical equipment to patients discharged from acute care and other facilities, (iv) oxygen and related chronic therapy services in the home, and (v) other HME devices and supplies on behalf of chronically ill patients with wound care, urological, incontinence, ostomy and nutritional supply needs. Revenues are recorded either (x) at a point in time for the sale of supplies and disposables, or (y) over the service period for equipment rental (including, but not limited to, CPAP machines, hospital beds, wheelchairs and other equipment), at amounts estimated to be received from patients or under reimbursement arrangements with Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors, including private insurers.
Cost of Net Revenue. Cost of net revenue primarily includes the cost of non-capitalized medical equipment and supplies, distribution expenses, labor costs, facilities rental costs, revenue cycle management costs and depreciation for capitalized patient equipment. Distribution expenses represent the cost incurred to coordinate and deliver products and services to the patients. Included in distribution expenses are leasing, maintenance, licensing and fuel costs for the vehicle fleet; salaries, benefits and other costs related to drivers and dispatch personnel; and amounts paid to couriers.
General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of corporate support costs including information technology, human resources, finance, contracting, legal, compliance leadership, equity-based compensation, transaction expenses and other administrative costs.
Depreciation and Amortization, Excluding Patient Equipment Depreciation. Depreciation expense includes depreciation charges for capital assets other than patient equipment (which is included as part of the cost of net revenue). Amortization expense includes amortization of identifiable intangible assets.
Factors Affecting AdaptHealth’s Operating Results
AdaptHealth’s operating results and financial performance are influenced by certain unique events during the periods discussed herein, including the following:
Acquisitions
AdaptHealth accounts for its acquisitions in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805, Business Combinations, and the operations of the acquired entities are included in the historical results of AdaptHealth for the periods following the closing of the acquisition. Refer to Note 3, Acquisitions, included in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding AdaptHealth’s acquisitions.
Debt and Recapitalization
In August 2021, AdaptHealth issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior unsecured notes due 2030 (the “5.125% Senior Notes”). The 5.125% Senior Notes will mature on March 1, 2030. Interest on the 5.125% Senior Notes is payable on March 1st and September 1st of each year, beginning on March 1, 2022. In January 2021, AdaptHealth issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior unsecured notes due 2029 (the “4.625% Senior Notes”). The 4.625% Senior Notes will mature on August 1, 2029. Interest on the 4.625% Senior Notes is payable on February 1st and August 1st of each year, beginning on August 1, 2021. In July 2020, AdaptHealth issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% senior unsecured notes due 2028 (the “6.125% Senior Notes”). The 6.125% Senior Notes will mature on August 1, 2028. Interest on the 6.125% Senior Notes is payable on February 1st and August 1st of each year, beginning on February 1, 2021. Refer to the section below, titled Liquidity and Capital Resources, for additional discussion related to AdaptHealth’s senior unsecured notes.
In January 2021, AdaptHealth refinanced its debt borrowings and entered into a new credit agreement with its existing bank group, which was subsequently amended in April 2021 (the “2021 Credit Agreement”). Refer to the section below, titled Liquidity and Capital Resources, for additional discussion related to the 2021 Credit Agreement.
In July 2020, AdaptHealth refinanced its then current debt borrowings and entered into a new credit agreement with a new bank group (the “2020 Credit Agreement”). The 2020 Credit Agreement consisted of a $250 million term loan (the “2020 Term Loan”) and $200 million in commitments for revolving credit loans. The amount borrowed under the 2020 Term Loan bore interest quarterly at variable rates based upon the sum of (a) the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (subject to a floor) equal to the LIBOR (as defined in the 2020 Credit Agreement) for the applicable interest period, plus (b) an applicable margin ranging from 2.50% to 3.75% per annum based on the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2020 Credit Agreement). Outstanding amounts borrowed under the 2020 Credit Agreement were repaid in full in connection with the January 2021 refinancing transaction discussed above.
In March 2019, AdaptHealth restructured its then existing debt borrowings, which consisted of a $300 million initial term loan, $50 million delayed draw term loan, and $75 million revolving credit facility. In November 2019, the Company repaid $50 million under the initial term loan. Outstanding amounts borrowed under such credit facility were repaid in full in connection with the July 2020 refinancing transaction discussed above.
In March 2019, AdaptHealth signed a Note and Unit Purchase Agreement with an investor. Pursuant to the agreement, AdaptHealth issued a promissory note with a principal amount of $100 million (the Promissory Note). In connection with the transactions completed as part of the Business Combination, the Promissory Note was replaced with a new amended and restated promissory note with a principal amount of $100 million, and the investor converted certain of its members’ interests to a $43.5 million promissory note. The new $100 million promissory note, together with the $43.5 million promissory note, are collectively referred to herein as the New Promissory Note. In June 2021, AdaptHealth repaid $71.8 million of the outstanding principal balance under the New Promissory Note. In August 2021, AdaptHealth repaid the remaining outstanding principal balance of $71.7 million under the New Promissory Note. The outstanding principal balance under the New Promissory Note bore interest at 12%.
Seasonality
AdaptHealth’s business experiences some seasonality. Its patients are generally responsible for a greater percentage of the cost of their treatment or therapy during the early months of the year due to co-insurance, co-payments and deductibles, and therefore may defer treatment and services of certain therapies until meeting their annual deductibles. In addition, changes to employer insurance coverage often go into effect at the beginning of each calendar year which may impact eligibility requirements and delay or defer treatment. Also, net revenue generated by the Company’s diabetes product line is typically higher in the fourth quarter compared to the earlier part of the year due to the timing of when patients meet their annual deductibles and their associated reordering patterns. These factors may lead to lower net revenue and cash flow in the early part of the year versus the latter half of the year. Additionally, the increased incidence of respiratory infections during the winter season may result in initiation of additional respiratory services such as oxygen therapy for certain patient populations. AdaptHealth’s quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future depending on these and other factors.
Key Business Metrics
AdaptHealth focuses on net revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less Patient Equipment Capex as it reviews its performance. Total net revenue is comprised of net sales revenue and net revenue from fixed monthly equipment reimbursements less implicit price concessions. Net sales revenue consists of revenue recognized at a point in time for the sale of supplies and disposables. Net revenue from fixed monthly equipment reimbursements consists of revenue recognized over the service period for equipment (including, but not limited to, CPAP machines, oxygen concentrators, ventilators, hospital beds, wheelchairs and other equipment).
Results of Operations
Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2021 and Year Ended December 31, 2020.
The following table summarizes AdaptHealth’s consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Net Revenue. Net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $2,454.5 million and $1,056.4 million, respectively, an increase of $1,398.1 million or 132.4%. Net revenue for 2021 and 2020 included $10.5 million and $36.5 million, respectively, from referral partners and healthcare facilities in support of their urgent needs as the coronavirus pandemic has led to an increased demand for respiratory equipment including ventilators and oxygen concentrators. Excluding this revenue, net revenue was $2,444.0 million and $1,019.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $1,424.1 million. The increase in net revenue was driven primarily by acquisitions completed after January 1, 2020, which increased net revenue by $1,443.0 million, primarily from the acquisition of AeroCare. This increase in net revenue was partially offset by planned declines in revenue from
the Company’s Patient Care Solutions (PCS) supplies business (which was acquired in January 2020) in connection with the Company’s turnaround efforts of that business executed subsequent to the acquisition. These turnaround efforts at PCS reduced net revenues for the 2021 period compared to the 2020 period as a result of the Company’s exit from poor performing payor contracts and products, which resulted in improved profitability for PCS. Net revenue generated by PCS for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $110.5 million and $130.2 million, respectively. Additionally, net revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021 was impacted by a recall of certain ventilator, BiPAP, and CPAP devices supplied to AdaptHealth by Philips Respironics (Philips). On June 14, 2021, AdaptHealth received notice from Philips that these devices would be included in a Philips voluntary recall due to potential health risks to patients. Currently, it is not possible to purchase these products from Philips, which has led to shortages in the supply chain, and other suppliers were unable to meet the strong patient demand for these products, which has materially affected AdaptHealth’s ability to service patient demand for these devices during the year ended December 31, 2021. Management estimates that the Philips recall reduced expected net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 by approximately $40 million to $45 million, with such impact primarily affecting net revenue in the fourth quarter.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net sales revenue (recognized at a point in time) comprised 67% of total net revenue, compared to 72% of total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 30, 2021, net revenue from fixed monthly equipment reimbursements comprised 33% of total net revenue, compared to 28% of total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. These changes are primarily due to a change in product mix, primarily from the acquisition of AeroCare.
Grant income. Grant income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 related to the recognition of amounts received under the CARES Act provider relief funds.
Cost of Net Revenue.
The following table summarizes cost of net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Cost of net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $2,008.9 million and $898.6 million, respectively, an increase of $1,110.3 million or 123.6%, which is primarily related to acquisition growth. Costs of products and supplies increased by $513.9 million primarily as a result of acquisition growth, primarily from the acquisition of AeroCare, and increased net sales revenue. Salaries, labor and benefits increased by $337.8 million, primarily related to acquisition growth and increased headcount, primarily from the acquisition of AeroCare. The increase in rent and occupancy and other operating expenses is related to acquisition growth.
Cost of net revenue was 81.8% of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 85.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The cost of products and supplies was 38.9% of net revenue in 2021 compared to 41.8% in 2020, primarily driven by increased scale and reduced vendor pricing. Salaries, labor and benefits was 24.3%
of net revenue in 2021 compared to 24.4% in 2020. Patient equipment depreciation was 7.9% of net revenue in 2021 compared to 6.7% in 2020, primarily as a result of a change in product mix as net revenue from fixed monthly equipment reimbursements as a percentage of total net revenue was higher in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily from the acquisition of AeroCare.
General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $167.5 million and $89.3 million, respectively, an increase of $78.2 million or 87.5%. This increase is primarily due to (1) increased transaction costs related to acquisition growth, primarily from the acquisition of AeroCare, (2) higher professional fees including legal, accounting and consulting, including costs for Sarbanes Oxley compliance, (3) higher labor costs associated with increased headcount, (4) higher equity-based compensation expense as a result of overall increased equity-based compensation grant activity and the accelerated vesting of certain awards, including $2.4 million in connection with the acceleration of vesting of certain equity awards in connection with the separation of the Company’s former Co-CEO, and (5) higher information technology-related expenses. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue was 6.8% in 2021, compared to 8.5% in 2020. General and administrative expenses in 2021 included $47.9 million in transaction costs, $18.0 million in equity-based compensation expense, and $2.4 million in severance expense. General and administrative expenses in 2020 included $25.4 million in transaction costs, $10.8 million in equity-based compensation expense, and $1.1 million in severance expense. Excluding the impact of these charges, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue was 4.0% and 4.9% in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Depreciation and amortization, excluding patient equipment depreciation. Depreciation and amortization, excluding patient equipment depreciation, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $63.1 million and $11.4 million, respectively, an increase of $51.7 million. The increase was primarily related to amortization expense of $46.5 million related to identifiable intangible assets recognized during 2021, primarily as a result of the acquisition of AeroCare, as compared to $6.0 million recognized during 2020.
Interest Expense. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $95.2 million and $41.4 million, respectively. Interest expense related to long-term debt was higher in 2021 compared to 2020 as a result of higher long-term debt borrowings outstanding during that period. Such borrowings were primarily used to fund acquisitions.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $20.2 million which consists of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to AdaptHealth refinancing its credit facility in January 2021, and also a debt prepayment penalty in connection with the early repayment of AdaptHealth’s note payable and the write-off of the associated unamortized deferred financing costs. Loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to AdaptHealth refinancing its credit facility in July 2020.
Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration Common Shares Liability. In connection with the Business Combination, certain former owners of AdaptHealth Holdings are entitled to contingent consideration common shares, as discussed in Note 11, Stockholders’ Equity - Contingent Consideration Common Shares, to the accompanying December 31, 2021 consolidated financial statements. These shares were liability-classified through December 31, 2021, and the change in fair value of the contingent consideration common shares liability represents a non-cash gain in 2021 and a non-cash charge in 2020 for the change in the estimated fair value of such liability during the respective periods.
Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability. AdaptHealth has outstanding warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock, as discussed in Note 11, Stockholders’ Equity - Warrants, to the accompanying December 31, 2021 consolidated financial statements. These warrants are liability-classified, and the change in fair value of the warrant liability represents a non-cash gain in 2021 and a non-cash charge in 2020 for the change in the estimated fair value of such liability during the respective periods.
Other Income (Loss), net. Other (income) loss, net for the year ended December 31, 2021 was a loss of $1.8 million, and consisted of $3.9 million of expenses associated with legal settlements and $1.9 million of expenses associated with lease terminations, offset by $0.9 million of net reductions in the fair value of contingent consideration
liabilities related to acquisitions, $0.7 million of equity income related to equity method investments, a gain of $0.5 million for the receipt of earnout proceeds in connection with an investment that was sold in 2020, and a $1.9 million gain in connection with the consolidation of an equity method investment. Other (income) loss, net for the year ended December 31, 2020 was income of $3.4 million, and consisted of $4.2 million net reductions in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities related to acquisitions, a gain of $0.6 million related to the sale of an investment, $0.1 million of equity income related to equity method investments, offset by a $1.5 million expense related to a transition services agreement executed in connection with an acquisition completed in 2020.
Income Tax Expense (Benefit). Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $32.8 million compared to an income tax benefit of $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in income tax expense was primarily related to increased pre-tax income and AdaptHealth Holding’s change in U.S. federal income tax classification as a result of the Tax Restructuring, as discussed in note 18, Income Taxes, to the accompanying December 31, 2021 consolidated financial statements.
Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2020 and Year Ended December 31, 2019.
The following table summarizes AdaptHealth’s consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Net Revenue. Net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $1,056.4 million and $529.6 million, respectively, an increase of $526.8 million or 99.5%. The increase in net revenue was driven primarily by (i) acquisitions completed during 2020, which contributed net revenue of $450.2 million during the year, (ii) organic growth resulting from stronger CPAP resupply sales and demographic growth in core markets, and (iii) net revenue of $36.5 million from referral partners and healthcare facilities in support of their urgent needs for ventilation and oxygen equipment for COVID-19 patients. These increases were partially offset by reduced demand for certain products that are related to elective medical services which is attributable to the coronavirus pandemic, such as CPAP new starts, orthotics, and certain other HME products, and this trend is expected to remain while the coronavirus crisis continues. However, the Company’s CPAP resupply and other supplies business remains healthy, as most patients for that business are in their homes and can be easily contacted to refresh their supplies. Additionally, the coronavirus pandemic has led to an increased demand for respiratory equipment including ventilators and oxygen concentrators.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net sales revenue (recognized at a point in time) comprised 72% of total net revenue, compared to 60% of total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in the proportion of net sales revenue compared to total net revenue was driven primarily by the PCS, Solara, ActivStyle and Pinnacle acquisitions, which are primarily supplies businesses, as well as the SleepMed and Choice acquisitions, which are primarily CPAP resupply businesses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, net revenue from fixed monthly equipment reimbursements comprised 28% of total net revenue, compared to 40% of total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Grant income. Grant income for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the recognition of amounts received under the CARES Act provider relief funds. There was no grant income recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Cost of Net Revenue.
The following table summarizes cost of net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Cost of net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $898.6 million and $440.7 million, respectively, an increase of $457.9 million or 103.9%, which is primarily related to acquisition growth. Costs of products and supplies increased by $285.5 million primarily as a result of acquisition growth, increased CPAP resupply sales, and expenses associated with the coronavirus pandemic, including increased personal protective equipment purchases. Salaries, labor and benefits increased by $104.7 million primarily related to acquisition growth and increased headcount, primarily from the PCS, Solara, ActivStyle and Pinnacle acquisitions. The increase in rent and occupancy and other operating expenses is related to acquisition growth, primarily from the aforementioned acquisitions.
Cost of net revenue was 85.0% of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 83.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The cost of products and supplies was 41.8% of net revenue in 2020 compared to
29.5% in 2019, while patient equipment depreciation was 6.7% of net revenue in 2020 compared to 11.2% in 2019. These changes are the result of a change in product mix as sales revenue was higher in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily from the PCS, Solara, ActivStyle and Pinnacle acquisitions.
General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $89.3 million and $56.5 million, respectively, an increase of $32.8 million or 58.2%. This increase is primarily due to (1) higher labor costs associated with increased headcount, (2) higher professional fees including legal, accounting and consulting, (3) increased transaction costs related to acquisition growth, (4) higher information technology related expenses, and (5) incremental costs associated with operating as a public company. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue was 8.5% in 2020, compared to 10.7% in 2019. General and administrative expenses in 2020 included $10.8 million in equity-based compensation expense, $25.4 million in transaction costs, $1.1 million in severance expense and $0.6 million in other non-recurring expenses. General and administrative expenses in 2019 included $11.1 million in equity-based compensation expense, $15.6 million in transaction costs, $1.4 million in severance expense and $0.5 million in other non-recurring expenses. Excluding the impact of these charges, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue was 4.9% and 5.3% in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Depreciation and amortization, excluding patient equipment depreciation. Depreciation and amortization, excluding patient equipment depreciation, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $11.4 million and $3.1 million, respectively, an increase of $8.3 million. The increase was primarily related to amortization expense of $6.0 million related to identifiable intangible assets recognized during 2020. There was no amortization expense of intangible assets recognized during 2019.
Interest Expense. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $41.4 million and $39.3 million, respectively. Interest expense related to long-term debt during 2020 increased by $13.5 million compared to 2019 as a result of higher long-term debt borrowings outstanding during that year. Interest expense during 2019 included non-cash interest expense of $11.4 million representing the change in fair value of the Company’s interest rate swap agreements; such amount would only be paid out if the interest rate swap agreements were terminated. On August 22, 2019, AdaptHealth designated its swaps as effective cash flow hedges. Accordingly, subsequent to August 22, 2019, changes in the fair value of its interest rate swaps are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) in equity rather than interest expense. As such, there was no non-cash interest expense related to changes in the fair value of the Company’s interest rate swap agreements during 2020.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $5.3 million which was a result of the write-off of deferred financing costs related to AdaptHealth refinancing its credit facility in July 2020. Loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $2.1 million which was a result of the write-off of deferred financing costs related to the 2019 Recapitalization.
Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration Common Shares Liability. In connection with the Business Combination, certain former owners of AdaptHealth Holdings are entitled to contingent consideration common shares. These shares were liability-classified, and the change in fair value of the contingent consideration common shares liability represents a non-cash charge for the change in the estimated fair value of such liability during the period.
Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability. AdaptHealth has outstanding warrants to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock. These warrants are liability-classified, and the change in fair value of the warrant liability represents a non-cash charge for the change in the estimated fair value of such liability during the period.
Other Income, net. Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of $4.2 million of net reductions in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities related to acquisitions, a gain of $0.6 million related to the sale of an investment, $0.1 million of equity income related to equity method investments, offset by a $1.5 million expense related to a transition services agreement in connection with an acquisition. Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of $0.2 million of net reductions in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities related to acquisitions and $0.1 million of equity income related to an equity method investment.
Income Tax Expense (Benefit). Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $12.0 million compared to income tax expense of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in income tax benefit/expense was primarily related to decreased pre-tax income associated with the tax paying entities.
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less Patient Equipment Capex
AdaptHealth uses EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less Patient Equipment Capex, which are financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, to analyze its financial results and believes that they are useful to investors, as a supplement to U.S. GAAP measures. In addition, AdaptHealth’s ability to incur additional indebtedness and make investments under its existing credit agreement is governed, in part, by its ability to satisfy tests based on a variation of Adjusted EBITDA.
AdaptHealth defines EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to AdaptHealth Corp., plus net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, interest expense, net, income tax expense (benefit), and depreciation and amortization.
AdaptHealth defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA (as defined above), plus loss on extinguishment of debt, equity-based compensation expense, transaction costs, severance, change in fair value of the contingent consideration common shares liability, change in fair value of the warrant liability, and other non-recurring items of expense (income).
AdaptHealth defines Adjusted EBITDA less Patient Equipment Capex as Adjusted EBITDA (as defined above) less patient equipment acquired during the period without regard to whether the equipment was purchased or financed through lease transactions.
AdaptHealth believes Adjusted EBITDA less Patient Equipment Capex is useful to investors in evaluating AdaptHealth’s financial performance. AdaptHealth’s business requires significant investment in equipment purchases to maintain its patient equipment inventory. Some equipment title transfers to patients’ ownership after a prescribed number of fixed monthly payments. Equipment that does not transfer wears out or oftentimes is not recovered after a patient’s use of the equipment terminates. AdaptHealth uses this metric as the profitability measure in its incentive compensation plans that have a profitability component and to evaluate acquisition opportunities, where it is most often used for purposes of contingent consideration arrangements. For purposes of this metric, patient equipment capital expenditure is measured as the value of the patient equipment received during the accounting period without regard to whether the equipment is purchased or financed through lease transactions.
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less Patient Equipment Capex should not be considered as measures of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and the items excluded from EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less Patient Equipment Capex are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Accordingly, these key business metrics have limitations as an analytical tool. They should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of AdaptHealth’s liquidity.
The following unaudited table presents the reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to AdaptHealth, to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less Patient Equipment Capex for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:
(a) Represents write offs of unamortized deferred financing costs related to refinancing of debt and pre-payment penalties for early debt payoff.
(b) Represents equity-based compensation expense for awards granted to employees and non-employee directors. The higher expense in 2021 is due to overall increased equity compensation grant activity in that period, as well as expense resulting from accelerated vesting of certain awards, including accelerated vesting of certain awards in connection with the separation of the Company’s former Co-CEO.
(c) Represents transaction costs related to acquisitions. The 2019 period also includes costs associated with the 2019 Recapitalization and the Business Combination.
(d) Represents severance costs related to acquisition integration and internal AdaptHealth restructuring and workforce reduction activities.
(e) Represents a non-cash charge or gain for the change in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration common shares liability. Refer to Note 11, Stockholders’ Equity - Contingent Consideration Common Shares, included in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 for additional discussion of such non-cash charge or gain.
(f) Represents a non-cash charge or gain for the change in the estimated fair value of the warrant liability. Refer to Note 11, Stockholders’ Equity - Warrants, included in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 for additional discussion of such non-cash charge or gain.
(g) The 2021 period includes $2.1 million of expenses related to legal and other costs associated with the separation of the Company’s former Co-CEO, $3.9 million of expenses associated with legal settlements, $1.9 million of expenses associated with lease terminations, and $0.2 million of net other non-recurring expenses, offset by a $1.9 million gain in connection with the consolidation of an equity method investment, and $0.9 million of net reductions in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities related to acquisitions. The 2020 period includes $4.2 million of net reductions in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities related to acquisitions, offset by a $1.5 million expense related to a transition services agreement executed in connection with an acquisition completed in 2020, and $0.2 million of net other non-recurring expenses. The 2019 period
includes $0.9 million of net increases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities related to acquisitions, and $0.5 million of other non-recurring expenses.
(h) Represents the value of patient equipment obtained during the respective period without regard to whether the equipment is purchased or financed through lease transactions.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
AdaptHealth’s principal sources of liquidity are its operating cash flows, borrowings under its credit agreements and other debt arrangements, and proceeds from equity issuances. AdaptHealth has used these funds to meet its capital requirements, which primarily consist of salaries, labor, benefits and other employee-related costs, product and supply costs, third-party customer service, billing and collections and logistics costs, capital expenditures including patient equipment, acquisitions and debt service. AdaptHealth’s future capital expenditure requirements will depend on many factors, including its patient volume and revenue growth rates.
AdaptHealth’s capital expenditures are made in advance of patients beginning service. Certain operating costs are incurred at the beginning of the equipment service period and during initial patient set up.
AdaptHealth believes that its expected operating cash flows, together with its existing cash, cash equivalents, and amounts available under its existing credit agreement, will continue to be sufficient to fund its operations and growth strategies for at least the next twelve months.
AdaptHealth may seek additional equity or debt financing in connection with the growth of its business, primarily for acquisitions. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may cause disruption in the capital markets, which could make financing more difficult and/or expensive. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, AdaptHealth may not be able to raise it on acceptable terms or at all. If additional capital is unavailable when desired, AdaptHealth’s business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.
As of December 31, 2021, AdaptHealth had approximately $149.6 million of cash and cash equivalents. To supplement its cash liquidity, in April 2020, AdaptHealth received recoupable advance payments of $45.8 million, which were made available by CMS under the CARES Act. In addition, in connection with an acquisition completed in July 2020, AdaptHealth assumed a liability of $3.7 million relating to CMS recoupable advance payments received by the acquired company prior to the date of acquisition. The recoupment of the advance payments by CMS began in April 2021 and is being applied to services provided and revenue recognized during the period in which the recoupment occurs, and will impact AdaptHealth’s cash receipts for services provided until such time all amounts have been recouped. During the year ended December 31, 2021, CMS has recouped a total of $36.7 million. As of December 31, 2021, AdaptHealth has deferred a total of $12.8 million related to CMS recoupable advance payments, which is included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, in April 2020, AdaptHealth received distributions of the CARES Act PRF of $17.2 million. Subsequent to April 2020, AdaptHealth completed several acquisitions in which the acquired companies received a total of $22.2 million of PRF payments prior to the applicable dates of acquisition. In connection with the accounting for these acquisitions, AdaptHealth recorded assumed liabilities of $7.7 million relating to the PRF payments received by the acquired companies. The PRF payments are targeted to offset lost revenue and expenditures incurred in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. The PRF payments are subject to certain restrictions and are subject to recoupment if not used for designated purposes. As a condition to receiving distributions, providers were required to agree to certain terms and conditions, including, among other things, that the funds would be used for lost revenues and unreimbursed COVID-19 related expenses as defined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”). All recipients of PRF payments were required to comply with the reporting requirements described in the terms and conditions and as determined by HHS. AdaptHealth recognizes grant payments as income when there is reasonable assurance that it has complied with the conditions associated with the grant. During the fourth quarter of each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, AdaptHealth recognized grant income of $10.6 million and $14.3 million, respectively, related to the PRF payments determined to comply with conditions associated with the grant.
HHS has indicated that the CARES Act PRF are subject to ongoing reporting and changes to the terms and conditions, and there have been several updates to such reporting requirements and terms and conditions since they were issued by HHS. Such updates have related to changes to the guidance regarding utilization of the funds granted from the PRF and updates to the reporting requirements of such funds, among other updates. To the extent that there is any future updated guidance from HHS or modifications to the terms and conditions, it may affect AdaptHealth’s ability to comply and AdaptHealth could be required to reverse the recognition of the grant income recorded and return a portion of the funds received, which could be material to AdaptHealth. AdaptHealth is continuing to monitor the terms and conditions issued by HHS. Furthermore, HHS has indicated that it will be closely monitoring and, along with the Office of Inspector General (United States) (OIG), auditing providers to ensure that recipients comply with the terms and conditions of relief programs and to prevent fraud and abuse. All providers will be subject to civil and criminal penalties for any deliberate omissions, misrepresentations or falsifications of any information given to HHS.
Also, as permitted under the CARES Act, AdaptHealth elected to defer certain portions of employer-paid FICA taxes otherwise payable from March 27, 2020 to January 1, 2021. In total, AdaptHealth deferred $8.6 million under this provision. AdaptHealth paid $4.3 million on January 4, 2022 and the remaining balance of $4.3 million is expected to be paid shortly after December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2021, $4.3 million is included in other current liabilities and $4.3 million is included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
At December 31, 2021, AdaptHealth had $785.0 million outstanding under its existing credit facility. In January 2021, AdaptHealth refinanced its debt borrowings and entered into a new credit agreement, which was subsequently amended in April 2021 (the “2021 Credit Agreement”). The 2021 Credit Agreement consists of a $800 million term loan (the “2021 Term Loan”) and $450 million in commitments for revolving credit loans with a $55 million letter of credit sublimit (the “2021 Revolver”), both with maturities in January 2026. The borrowing under the 2021 Term Loan requires quarterly principal repayments of $5.0 million beginning June 30, 2021 through March 31, 2023, increasing to $10.0 million beginning June 30, 2023 through December 31, 2025, and the unpaid principal balance is due at maturity in January 2026. Borrowings under the 2021 Revolver may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including for capital expenditures and acquisitions permitted under the 2021 Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2021, and the date of this filing, there were no outstanding borrowings under the 2021 Revolver. Amounts borrowed under the 2021 Credit Agreement bear interest quarterly at variable rates based upon the sum of (a) the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (subject to a zero percent floor) equal to the LIBOR (as defined) for the applicable interest period multiplied by the statutory reserve rate, plus (b) an applicable margin (as defined) ranging from 1.50% to 3.25% per annum based on the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined). The 2021 Revolver carries a commitment fee during the term of the 2021 Credit Agreement ranging from 0.25% to 0.50% per annum of the actual daily undrawn portion of the 2021 Revolver based on the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio.
Under the 2021 Credit Agreement, AdaptHealth is subject to a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things, impose operating and financial restrictions on AdaptHealth. Financial covenants include a Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio and a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, both as defined in the 2021 Credit Agreement. The 2021 Credit Agreement also contains certain customary events of default, including, among other things, failure to make payments when due thereunder, failure to observe or perform certain covenants, cross-defaults, bankruptcy and insolvency-related events, and non-compliance with healthcare laws. Any borrowing under the 2021 Credit Agreement may be repaid, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs, and any amounts repaid under the 2021 Revolver may be reborrowed. Mandatory prepayments are required under the 2021 Revolver when borrowings and letter of credit usage exceed the total commitments for revolving credit loans. Mandatory prepayments are also required in connection with the disposition of assets to the extent not reinvested, unpermitted debt transactions, and excess cash flow, as defined, if certain leverage tests are not met. AdaptHealth was in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2021.
In August 2021, AdaptHealth LLC issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior unsecured notes due 2030 (the “5.125% Senior Notes”). The 5.125% Senior Notes will mature on March 1, 2030. Interest on the 5.125% Senior Notes is payable on March 1st and September 1st of each year, beginning on March 1, 2022.

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, AdaptHealth had working capital of $170.2 million and a working capital deficit of $58.8 million, respectively. A significant portion of AdaptHealth’s assets consists of accounts receivable from third-party payors that are responsible for payment for the products and services that AdaptHealth provides.
Cash Flow. The following table presents selected data from AdaptHealth’s consolidated statements of cash flows for years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:
Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $275.7 million and $195.6 million, respectively, an increase of $80.1 million. The increase was the result of (1) a $352.2 million improvement in net income, (2) a net decrease of $85.4 million in non-cash charges, primarily from the change in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration common shares liability and warrant liability, amortization, equity-based compensation expense, write-off of deferred financing costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, non-cash reduction in the carrying amount of operating lease right-of-use assets and changes in fair value of contingent consideration, (3) a $43.5 million change in deferred income taxes, (4) a net $139.2 million decrease resulting from the change in operating assets and liabilities, primarily from the change in accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable and accrued expenses (excluding the impact of cash received in the 2020 period in connection with the CARES Act discussed below), and (5) a decrease of $28.0 million in operating lease obligations, which was offset by the receipt of $45.8 million of recoupable advanced payments from CMS and the receipt of $17.2 million of provider relief fund payments in connection with the CARES Act in 2020.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $195.6 million and $60.4 million, respectively, an increase of $135.2 million.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates
The discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements requires its management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company’s management bases its estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements which, in turn, could change the results from those reported. In addition, actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the Company’s financial position and results of operations.
Critical accounting policies and significant estimates are those that the Company’s management considers the most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations because they require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company’s critical accounting policies and significant estimates in relation to its consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, business combinations, and valuation of goodwill and long-lived assets.
Revenue Recognition
The Company generates revenues for services and related products that the Company provides to patients for home medical equipment, related supplies, and other items. The Company’s revenues are recognized in the period in which services and related products are provided to customers and are recorded either at a point in time for the sale of supplies and disposables, or over the fixed monthly service period for equipment.
Revenues are recognized when control of the promised good or service is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to receive from patients or under reimbursement arrangements with Medicare, Medicaid and third-party payors, in exchange for those goods and services.
The Company determines the transaction price based on contractually agreed-upon amounts or rates, adjusted for estimates of variable consideration, such as implicit price concessions. The Company utilizes the expected value method to determine the amount of variable consideration that should be included to arrive at the transaction price, using contractual agreements and historical reimbursement experience within each payor type. The Company applies constraint to the transaction price, such that net revenue is recorded only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in the future. If actual amounts of
consideration ultimately received differ from the Company’s estimates, the Company adjusts these estimates, which would affect net revenue in the period such adjustments become known.
Sales revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. Revenues for the sale of sleep therapy equipment supplies (including CPAP resupply products), durable medical equipment and related supplies (including wheelchairs, hospital beds and infusion pumps), diabetic medical devices and supplies (including continuous glucose monitors (CGM) and insulin pumps), and other HME products and supplies are recognized when control of the promised good or service is transferred to customers, which is generally upon shipment for direct to consumer medical devices and supplies and upon delivery to the home for durable medical equipment.
The Company provides certain equipment to patients which is reimbursed periodically in fixed monthly payments for as long as the patient is using the equipment and medical necessity continues (in certain cases, the fixed monthly payments are capped at a certain amount). The equipment provided to the patient is based upon medical necessity as documented by prescriptions and other documentation received from the patient’s physician. The patient generally does not negotiate or select the manufacturer or model of the equipment prescribed by their physician and delivered by the Company. Once initial delivery of this equipment is made to the patient for initial setup, a monthly billing process is established based on the initial setup service date. The Company recognizes the fixed monthly revenue ratably over the service period as earned, less estimated adjustments, and defers revenue for the portion of the monthly bill that is unearned. No separate revenue is earned from the initial setup process. Included in fixed monthly revenue are unbilled amounts for which the revenue recognition criteria had been met as of period-end but were not yet billed to the payor. The estimate of net unbilled fixed monthly revenue recognized is based on historical trends and estimates of future collectability.
The Company’s billing system contains payor-specific price tables that reflect the fee schedule amounts in effect or contractually agreed upon by various government and commercial insurance payors for each item of equipment or supply provided to a customer. Revenues are recorded based on the applicable fee schedule. The Company has established a contractual allowance to account for adjustments that result from differences between the payment amount received and the expected realizable amount. If the payment amount received differs from the net realizable amount, an adjustment is recorded to revenues in the period that these payment differences are determined. The Company reports revenues in its consolidated financial statements net of such adjustments.
Accounts Receivable
Due to the continuing changes in the healthcare industry and third-party reimbursement environment, certain estimates are required to record accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. The complexity of third-party billing arrangements and laws and regulations governing Medicare and Medicaid may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded.
The Company performs a periodic analysis to review the valuation of accounts receivable and collectability of outstanding balances. Management’s evaluation takes into consideration such factors as historical cash collections experience, business and economic conditions, trends in healthcare coverage, other collection indicators and information about specific receivables. The Company’s evaluation also considers the age and composition of the outstanding amounts in determining their estimated net realizable value.
Receivables are considered past due when not collected by established due dates. Specific patient balances are written off after collection efforts have been followed and the account has been determined to be uncollectible. Revisions in reserve estimates are recorded as an adjustment to net revenue in the period of revision.
Included in accounts receivable are earned but unbilled accounts receivables. Billing delays, ranging from several days to several weeks, can occur due to the Company’s policy of compiling required payor specific documentation prior to billing for its services rendered.
Business Combinations
The Company applies the acquisition method of accounting for business acquisitions. The results of operations of the businesses acquired by the Company are included as of the respective acquisition date. The acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred, including the fair value of any contingent consideration, is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. To the extent the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred exceeds the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, such excess is allocated to goodwill. Patient relationships, medical records and patient lists are not reported as separate intangible assets due to the regulatory requirements and lack of contractual agreements but are part of goodwill. Customer related relationships are not reported as separate intangible assets but are part of goodwill as authorizing physicians are under no obligation to refer the Company’s services to their patients, who are free to change physicians and service providers at any time. The Company may adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, as it obtains more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed that existed but were not available at the acquisition date, which is generally up to one year after the acquisition closing date. Acquisition related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.
Valuation of Goodwill
The Company has a significant amount of goodwill on its balance sheet that resulted from the business acquisitions the Company has made in recent years. Goodwill is not amortized and is assessed for impairment annually and upon the occurrence of a triggering event or change in circumstances indicating a possible impairment. Such changes in circumstance can include, among others, changes in the legal environment, reimbursement environment, operating performance, and/or future prospects. The Company performs its annual impairment assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year. The impairment assessment can be performed on either a quantitative or qualitative basis. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. If determined necessary, the Company applies the quantitative impairment test to identify and measure the amount of impairment, if any.
Long-Lived Assets
The Company’s long-lived assets, such as equipment and other fixed assets and definite-lived identifiable intangible assets, are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.
Definite-lived identifiable intangible assets consist of tradenames, payor contracts, contractual rental agreements and developed technology. These assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed. These assets are assessed for impairment consistent with the Company’s long-lived assets. The following table summarizes the useful lives of the identifiable intangible assets acquired:
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently issued accounting pronouncements that may be relevant to the Company’s operations but have not yet been adopted are outlined in Note 2 (dd), Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, to its consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Commitments and Contingencies
In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to loss contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business that cover a wide range of matters. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 450, Accounting for Contingencies, the Company records accruals for such loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. The Company reviews its accruals at least quarterly and adjusts accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. At this time, the Company has no material accruals related to lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings. While there can be no assurance, based on the Company’s evaluation of information currently available, the Company’s management believes any liability that may ultimately result from resolution of such loss contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial conditions or results of operations. However, the Company’s assessment may be affected by limited information. Accordingly, the Company’s assessment may change in the future based upon availability of new information and further developments in the proceedings of such matters. The results of legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and material adverse outcomes are possible.
In connection with the Company’s acquisition of PPS HME Holdings LLC (PPS), in May 2018, the Company assumed a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) at one of PPS’ subsidiaries, Braden Partners L.P. d/b/a Pacific Pulmonary Services (BP). The CIA was entered into with the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (OIG). The CIA has a five-year term which expires in April 2022. In connection with the acquisition and integration of PPS by AdaptHealth, the OIG confirmed that the requirements of the CIA imposed upon BP would only apply to the operations of BP and therefore no operations of any other AdaptHealth affiliate are subject to the requirements of the CIA following the acquisition. On December 16, 2021, the OIG-HHS notified PPS that its report for the period ended March 31, 2021 had been accepted and PPS had satisfied its obligations under the CIA as of such date.
On July 25, 2017, AdaptHealth Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“AdaptHealth Holdings”), was served with a subpoena by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (“EDPA”) pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §3486 to produce certain audit records and internal communications regarding ventilator billing. The investigation focused on billing practices regarding one payor that contracted for bundled payments for certain ventilators. AdaptHealth Holdings has cooperated with investigators and, through agreement with the EDPA, has submitted all information requested in the Company’s possession. An independent third party was retained by AdaptHealth Holdings that identified overpayments and underpayments for ventilator billings related to the payor, and a remittance was sent to reconcile that account. On October 3, 2019, the Company received a follow-up civil investigative demand from the EDPA regarding a document previously produced to the EDPA and patients included in the review by the independent third party. The Company has responded to the EDPA and supplemented its production as requested with any relevant documents in the Company’s possession. During subsequent communications, the EDPA indicated to the Company that the investigation remained ongoing. The EDPA also requested additional information regarding certain patient services and claims refunds processed by the Company in 2017. The Company produced this information in coordination with the EDPA. The EDPA has also raised questions regarding other aspects of ventilator billing. While the Company cannot provide any assurance as to whether the EDPA will seek additional information or pursue this matter further, it does not believe that the investigation will have a material adverse effect on the Company.
In March 2019, prior to its acquisition by the Company, AeroCare was served with a civil investigative demand (“CID”) issued by the United States Attorney for the Western District of Kentucky (“WDKY”). The CID seeks to investigate allegations that AeroCare improperly billed, or caused others to improperly bill, for oxygen tank contents that were not delivered to beneficiaries. The WDKY has requested documents related to such oxygen tank content billing as
well as other categories of information. AeroCare has cooperated with the WDKY and has produced documents and provided explanations of its billing practices. In September 2020, the WDKY indicated the investigation includes alleged violations of the federal False Claims Act and as well as alleged violations of state Medicaid false claims acts in ten states. AeroCare has cooperated fully with the investigation and has indicated to the WDKY that concerns raised do not accurately identify Medicare coverage criteria and that state Medicaid coverage requirements generally do not provide for separate reimbursement for portable gaseous oxygen contents in the circumstances at issue. While the Company cannot provide any assurance as to whether the WDKY will seek additional information or pursue this matter further, it does not believe that the investigation will have a material adverse effect on the Company.
On June 28, 2019, Solara, which was acquired by the Company in July 2020, determined that an unauthorized third-party gained access to a limited number of employee email accounts beginning in April 2019, as a result of a phishing email campaign. Solara undertook a comprehensive review of the accounts to identify what personal information was stored within the accounts and to whom that information related. In connection with the incident, Solara notified potentially affected individuals and reported this incident to law enforcement and relevant state and federal regulators. Solara was a defendant in a class action regarding the incident in federal court. In October 2021, the parties tentatively agreed to a settlement for a payment of $5.1 million, which will be covered in full by insurance and an escrow established at the time of the Solara acquisition. On January 25, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Approval of the settlement. As of December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a liability of $5.1 million and a corresponding indemnification asset, which are included in other current liabilities and other current assets, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
On July 29, 2021, Robert Charles Faille Jr., a purported shareholder of the Company, filed a purported class action complaint against the Company and certain of its current and former officers in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the “Complaint”). The Complaint purports to be asserted on behalf of a class of persons who purchased the Company’s stock between November 11, 2019 and July 16, 2021. The Complaint generally alleges that the Company and certain of its current and former officers violated federal securities laws by making allegedly false and misleading statements and/or failing to disclose material information regarding the Company’s organic growth trajectory. The Complaint seeks unspecified damages. On October 14, 2021, the Delaware County Employees Retirement System and the Bucks County Employees Retirement System were named Lead Plaintiffs. Pursuant to the scheduling order, Lead Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on November 22, 2021 (the “Consolidated Complaint”), which asserts substantially the same claim, but adds a number of current and former directors of the Company as additional defendants and a new theory of recovery based on the Company’s alleged failure to disclose information concerning the Company’s former Co-CEO’s alleged tax fraud arising from certain past private activity. On January 20, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint. Lead Plaintiffs’ opposition to defendants’ motion is due on March 21, 2022, and defendants’ reply is due April 15, 2022.
The Company intends to vigorously defend against the allegations contained in the Consolidated Complaint, but there can be no assurance that the defense will be successful.
On December 6, 2021, a putative shareholder of the Company, Carol Hessler, filed a shareholder derivative complaint against certain current and former directors and officers of the Company in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the “Derivative Complaint”). The Derivative Complaint generally alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties owed to the Company by allegedly causing or allowing misrepresentations and/or omissions regarding the Company’s organic growth and the Company’s former Co-CEO’s alleged criminal activity, failing to maintain an adequate system of oversight, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controls over financial reporting and due diligence into the Company’s management team, and engaging in insider trading. The Derivative Complaint also alleges claims for waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment. Finally, the Derivative Complaint alleges that certain of the individual defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act by allegedly negligently issuing, causing to be issued, and participating in the issuance of materially misleading statements to stockholders in the Company’s Proxy Statements on Schedule DEF 14A in connection with a Special Meeting of Stockholders, held on March 3, 2021, and the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, held on July 27, 2021. The Derivative Complaint seeks, among other things, an award of money damages.
The Company intends to vigorously defend against the allegations contained in the Derivative Complaint, but there can be no assurance that the defense will be successful.
