Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the section entitled “Risk Factors,” our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Please also see the section entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Industry Data” of this Annual Report.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to discovering and developing transformative treatments for hearing and balance disorders, one of the largest areas of unmet need in medicine. We aim to restore and improve hearing and balance through the restoration and regeneration of functional hair cells and non-sensory support cells within the inner ear. We have built a proprietary platform that integrates single-cell genomics and bioinformatics analyses, precision gene therapy technologies and our expertise in inner ear biology. We are leveraging our platform to advance our pipeline of preclinical gene therapy programs that are designed to selectively replace genes for the treatment of congenital, monogenic hearing loss and to regenerate inner ear hair cells for the treatment of acquired hearing and balance disorders. We are developing our lead gene therapy product candidate, DB-OTO, to provide hearing to individuals born with profound hearing loss due to mutation of the otoferlin, or OTOF, gene. In addition to DB-OTO, we are advancing AAV.103 to restore hearing in individuals with mutations in the gap junction beta-2, or GJB2, gene and AAV.104 to restore hearing in individuals with mutations in the stereocilin, or STRC, gene. We have gene therapy programs to convert supporting cells, the cells adjacent to hair cells, into either cochlear or vestibular hair cells in order to restore hearing or balance function. In addition to our gene therapy programs, we are developing DB-020 for the prevention of cisplatin-induced hearing loss, which we are currently evaluating in patients in a Phase 1b clinical trial.
Since inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources on organizing and staffing, business planning, raising capital, establishing our intellectual property portfolio and performing research and development of our product candidates, programs and platform. On February 5, 2021, we issued and sold 15,870,209 shares of our Series D convertible preferred stock for $27.4 million of aggregate cash proceeds, net of issuance costs. On February 17, 2021, we completed an initial public offering, or IPO, of our common stock in which we issued and sold 7,062,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $18.00 per share, and on February 24, 2021, we issued and sold an additional 600,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the underwriters’ partial exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock, for aggregate net proceeds of $125.0 million. Upon the closing of our IPO, all of our outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock automatically converted into 16,662,011 shares of common stock. Subsequent to the closing of our IPO, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding. To date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from sales of our convertible preferred stock (including borrowings under convertible promissory notes, which converted into convertible preferred stock in 2015), payments under our license and collaboration agreement with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Regeneron, and, most recently, from the sale of common stock in our IPO.
We have not generated any revenue from product sales, and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for at least the next several years. All of our programs are still in preclinical and early-stage clinical development. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates, if approved. Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $51.8 million and $39.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $214.5 million. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:
•submit an investigational new drug application, or IND, or clinical trial application, or CTA, and initiate a planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial of DB-OTO for the treatment of profound hearing loss due to mutation of the OTOF gene;
•continue our current research programs and our preclinical development of DB-OTO, AAV.103, AAV.104, AAV.201, DB-ATO and any product candidates that may arise from our current or future research programs;
•continue our clinical development of DB-020, including our ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial;
•advance additional product candidates into preclinical and clinical development;
•expand the capabilities of and invest in our platform;
•seek marketing approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;
•ultimately establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval;
•expand, maintain and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•hire additional clinical, research, development, scientific, regulatory and quality control personnel;
•establish and maintain agreements with manufacturers for our product candidates; and
•add operational, legal, compliance, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our research, product development and future commercialization efforts and support our operations as a public company.
In addition, as we progress toward marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution.
As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and other sources of capital, which may include collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties when needed or on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or enter into such other agreements when needed, we may have to significantly delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of our product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve profitability. Even if we are able to generate revenue from product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities of $162.3 million. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2021, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2024. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we anticipate.
Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business
The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has affected and may affect in the future our ability to initiate and complete preclinical studies, delay the initiation and completion of our current and planned clinical trials, disrupt regulatory activities or have other adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, the pandemic has caused substantial disruption to global supply chains and may adversely impact economies worldwide, both of which could adversely affect our business, operations and ability to raise funds to support our operations.
We are following, and plan to continue to follow, recommendations from federal, state and local governments regarding workplace policies, practices and procedures. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and in accordance with direction from state and local governmental authorities, we previously restricted access to our facility to those individuals who must perform critical research, translational medicine and laboratory support activities that must be completed on site, limited the number of such people that can be present at our facility at any one time, and required that most of our employees work remotely. In February 2022 we re-opened our facility to all of our employees. Screening and enrollment in our ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial of DB-020 in Australia and the United States have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient screening and enrollment were paused in the second quarter of 2020 in both Australia and the United States, and screening for enrollment did not resume until early in the third quarter of 2020 in Australia and early in the fourth quarter of 2020 in the United States. We have also experienced delays in site start-up and the withdrawal of some sites in the United States. In addition, we and the third-party manufacturers, contract research organizations and academic collaborators that we engage have faced in the past and may face in the future disruptions that could affect our ability to initiate and
complete preclinical studies or clinical trials. This includes disruptions in procuring items that are essential for our research and development activities, such as, for example, raw materials used in the manufacture of our product candidates, laboratory supplies for our preclinical studies and clinical trials, or animals that are used for preclinical testing, in each case, for which there may be shortages because of ongoing efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions.
We cannot be certain what the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will be on our business. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business will depend on the length and severity of the pandemic, including the extent there is any resurgence of the COVID-19 virus or any variant strains of the virus, the availability and effectiveness of vaccines and the impact of the foregoing on our preclinical studies, current and planned clinical trials, employees and vendors, which is uncertain and cannot be predicted. The pandemic has the potential to adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
License and Collaboration Agreement with Regeneron
In November 2017, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Regeneron, or the Regeneron Agreement. The Regeneron Agreement had an original research term of five years and granted Regeneron the right to extend the research term for up to two years in one-year intervals. In November 2021, Regeneron exercised its right to extend the research term and extended the research term by one year to November 2023. The Regeneron Agreement is focused on the discovery and development of new potential therapies directed to a set of defined collaboration targets. We are currently developing DB-OTO, AAV.103 and AAV.104 in collaboration with Regeneron under the Regeneron Agreement. In October 2020, we entered into an amendment to the Regeneron Agreement pursuant to which, among other things, ATOH1, the target of our DB-ATO program, was removed as a collaboration target and the terms and plans for the DB-OTO and AAV.103 programs were modified. We issued 10,000,000 shares of our Series C convertible preferred stock to Regeneron in consideration for its entry into the amendment.
Pursuant to the Regeneron Agreement, Regeneron paid us an upfront fee of $25.0 million and purchased 12,500,000 shares of our Series B convertible preferred stock at a price per share of $2.00. Regeneron is provided two options to extend the research term for a one-year period each and is obligated to pay us $10.0 million for each extension. The first option to extend the research term was exercised by Regeneron in November 2021. The $10.0 million fee is payable in the fourth quarter of 2022.On a collaboration-product-by-collaboration-product basis, upon achievement of pre-defined milestones which began at initiation of manufacturing to support GLP toxicology studies and conclude at initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial, Regeneron is obligated to pay us milestone payments of up to $35.5 million in aggregate if the collaboration product is a biologic or up to $33.5 million in aggregate if the collaboration product is a small molecule, which is intended to reflect approximately half of the total cost needed to achieve the next milestone. From and after the initiation of a registration-enabling trial, unless Regeneron decides to opt-out, we have agreed to split development and regulatory costs with Regeneron on an equal basis through the registration-enabling trials. Through December 31, 2021, we had received an aggregate of $5.5 million in milestone payments from Regeneron pursuant to the collaboration.
Under the Regeneron Agreement, we are required to pay Regeneron tiered royalties on the worldwide net sales of collaboration products at percentages which range from mid-single digit to mid-thirties, with the exact royalty rate depending on the extent to which Regeneron shared in the funding of the collaboration product, the level of net sales of the collaboration product, the nature of any intellectual property contributed by Regeneron included in the collaboration product and whether the product is sold inside or outside the field. In the case of collaboration products for which Regeneron does not opt-out, our obligation to pay tiered royalties on the worldwide net sales ranges from percentages in the mid-twenties to mid-thirties. In the case of collaboration products for which Regeneron opts-out, our obligation to pay tiered royalties on the worldwide net sales ranges from percentages in the mid-single digits to mid-twenties. Our obligation to make royalty payments to Regeneron on account of worldwide net sales of collaboration products continues so long as we, our affiliates, licensees or sublicensees sell collaboration products. To date, we have not made any royalty or other payments to Regeneron under the Regeneron Agreement.
Pursuant to the amendment to the Regeneron Agreement, Regeneron agreed to pay us $0.3 million to fund our ongoing research program and $0.5 million to help secure the services of a contract development and manufacturing organization. The $0.5 million payment was creditable against the milestone associated with the initiation of manufacturing to support GLP toxicology studies of DB-OTO. Additionally, Regeneron agreed to reimburse us for up to $10.5 million of third-party costs related to the GLP toxicology studies of DB-OTO as such costs are incurred, and we agreed that the aggregate potential milestone payments for DB-OTO would be reduced by $15.0 million. In addition, notwithstanding its removal from the collaboration, for DB-ATO, we agreed to pay to Regeneron a royalty calculated as a low-to mid-single digit percentage of net sales of DB-ATO, on a country-by-country basis, until the latest of the expiration of the last patent covering DB-ATO in such
country, the expiration of all applicable regulatory exclusivities for DB-ATO in such country and the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of DB-ATO in such country.
As of December 31, 2021, we had unbilled receivables of $11.4 million due from Regeneron, comprised of $1.4 million for the remaining balance of reimbursable third-party costs related to IND enabling studies for DB-OTO and $10.0 million relating to Regeneron exercising its right to extend the research term by one year to November 2023.
Because we consider Regeneron a collaborative partner that is subject to the significant risks and rewards under the Regeneron Agreement, we have accounted for the Regeneron Agreement under FASB ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements, or ASC 808. Under ASC 808, we view all consideration received from Regeneron as reimbursement of our costs under the Regeneron Agreement. These costs are accounted for as research and development expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). As such, we are recognizing total consideration of $46.9 million, comprised of the $25.0 million upfront payment, the additional payment of $0.3 million received from Regeneron pursuant to the amendment, the reimbursement of $10.5 million of third-party costs related to the GLP toxicology studies of DB-OTO, the $5.5 million of cumulative milestone payments received, and the $10.0 million extension payment due in the fourth quarter of 2022, net of the $4.4 million in fair value of the Series C convertible preferred stock issued to Regeneron, over the research term as a reduction to research and development expenses (contra-research and development expense) in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) based on our progress toward completion of our research activities under the research plan. Any future milestone payments will be included in the measurement of contra-research and development expense if and when achieved. We recognized $11.0 million and $2.0 million as contra-research and development expenses during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $11.4 million and $1.2 million of accounts receivable due from Regeneron, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had total deferred collaboration liabilities of $24.5 million and $15.2 million on our consolidated balance sheet, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020 we had $8.1 million and $11.0 million of current deferred collaboration liabilities, respectively, and $16.4 million and $4.2 million of long-term deferred collaboration liabilities, respectively. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Financial Operations Overview
Revenue
We have not generated any revenue since inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products for at least the next several years. If our development efforts for our current or future product candidates are successful and result in marketing approval or if we enter into collaboration or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales or payments from third-party collaborators or licensors.
Operating Expenses
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities and development of our programs and product candidates. These expenses include:
•personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions;
•expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, such as consultants and investigative sites that conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials and in-licensing arrangements;
•costs incurred to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements;
•costs incurred with third-party contract development and manufacturing organizations, or CDMOs, to acquire, develop and manufacture materials for preclinical and clinical studies;
•costs associated with our technology and our intellectual property portfolio;
•expenses incurred for the procurement of materials, laboratory supplies and non-capital equipment used in the research and development process; and
•depreciation, amortization and other direct and allocated expenses, including rent, insurance and other operating costs, incurred as a result of our research and development activities.
We use our employee and infrastructure resources for the advancement of our platform and for discovering and developing programs and product candidates. We track direct research and development costs, consisting primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to CDMOs, CROs and consultants in connection with our preclinical studies, clinical trials and experiments by program after a development candidate has been identified. Due to the number of ongoing programs and our ability to use resources across several projects, personnel-related expenses and indirect or shared operating costs incurred for our research and development programs are not recorded or maintained on a program-by-program basis, nor are our external program costs incurred for our programs prior to the identification of a development candidate for such program.
The following table reflects our research and development expense, including direct program-specific expense summarized by program, personnel-related expenses and indirect or shared operating costs recognized during each period presented (in thousands):
Consideration we receive under our license and collaboration agreement with Regeneron is being recognized as a reduction to research and development expense (contra-research and development expense) in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) based on our progress towards completion of our research activities under the research plan for the collaboration. For purposes of the table above, recognition of consideration received from Regeneron is included as a reduction of other indirect research and development expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized contra-research and development expense of approximately $11.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, related to consideration received from Regeneron.
Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future as we advance our programs and product candidates into and through the development phase, and as we continue to develop additional product candidates. We also expect our discovery research efforts and our related personnel costs will increase and, as a result, we expect our research and development expenses, including costs associated with stock-based compensation, will increase above historical levels. In addition, we may incur additional expenses related to milestone and royalty payments payable to third parties with whom we may enter into license, acquisition and option agreements to acquire the rights to future product candidates.
At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of, and obtain regulatory approval for, any of our product candidates or programs. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug development, including the uncertainty of:
•the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities;
•the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;
•our ability to successfully complete clinical trials with safety, potency and purity profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority;
•our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and then successfully commercialize, our product candidates;
•our ability to hire and retain key research and development personnel;
•our successful enrollment in and completion of clinical trials;
•the costs associated with the development of any additional product candidates we develop or acquire through collaborations;
•our ability to establish and maintain agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical trials and commercial manufacturing, if our product candidates are approved;
•the terms and timing of any collaboration, license or other arrangement, including the terms and timing of any milestone payments thereunder;
•our ability to obtain and maintain patent, trade secret and other intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates if and when approved;
•our receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•our ability to commercialize products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;
•the continued acceptable safety profiles of the product candidates following approval; and
•the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our research and development employees, contractors and those who may participate in our studies.
A change in any of these variables with respect to the progress of any of our product candidates would significantly change the costs, timing and viability associated with the development of that product candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any product candidate we may develop.
General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance, legal, business development, human resources and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to corporate matters and costs to secure and defend our intellectual property; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax, human resources and administrative consulting services; insurance costs; administrative travel expenses and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for office rent and other operating costs. These costs relate to the operation of the business, unrelated to the research and development function, or any individual program.
We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support the expected growth in our research and development activities and the potential commercialization of our product candidates. We also expect to continue to incur increased expenses associated with being a public company, including increased costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance costs and investor and public relations costs. We also expect to incur additional intellectual property-related expenses as we file patent applications to protect innovations arising from our research and development activities.
Interest Income
Interest income consists of interest income earned from our cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities.
Other Income, net
Other income, net primarily consists of income received from the sale of consumables and other supplies to third parties that we were not using and were not planning to use in the future.
Income Taxes
Since our inception, we have not recorded any U.S. federal, foreign, or state income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in each year or for our earned research and development tax credits, as it is more likely-than-not that these benefits will not be realized. We have U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income. We have recognized a reserve for a foreign uncertain tax position and recorded a foreign tax provision.
Income taxes are determined at the applicable tax rates adjusted for non-deductible expenses, research and development tax credits and other permanent differences. Our income tax provision may be significantly affected by changes to our estimates.
Restructuring
In January and May 2020, we had a reduction in force that included 45 full-time employees, which represented approximately 52% of our full-time employee workforce. The reduction in force was primarily comprised of positions related to research and general and administrative services and was implemented in connection with our determination to focus and reprioritize our resources on gene therapy programs for hearing and balance disorders and to eliminate our research efforts on other discovery programs for hearing loss. As a result of the reduction, we incurred expenses of approximately $3.5 million, comprised of termination benefits including severance, benefits and other payroll-related charges. During the first quarter of 2020, we established retention agreements with certain key employees, including one of our executive officers. Under the terms of these agreements, we agreed to make three retention payments to each key employee totaling $1.6 million in the aggregate if they remained employed at the Company through specified milestones. The first payments of $0.7 million in the aggregate were due upon execution of the retention agreements. The second payments of $0.4 million in the aggregate were paid to the key employees upon the closing of the Series D financing in November 2020. The third payments of $0.5 million in the aggregate were paid in January 2021, including payments to certain employees who were required to remain employed through January 1, 2022 in order to retain the first and third payments. These prepayments were amortized over the remaining employee service terms under the retention agreements.
During the second quarter of 2020, we established additional employee bonuses in the aggregate amount of $0.4 million for the majority of employees who were not party to a retention agreement. The bonuses became due upon the closing of the Series D financing in November 2020. All amounts owed related to the additional employee bonuses were paid prior to December 31, 2020.
Restructuring expenses are classified as research and development expenses or general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in the manner in which the respective employee’s salary and related costs were classified.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations for each period presented (in thousands):
Research and Development Expenses
The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for each period presented (in thousands):
Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $29.8 million, compared to $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $4.5 million was primarily attributable to the following:
•$15.4 million increase in expenses incurred to advance our DB-OTO program, primarily attributable to an increase of $12.8 million in third-party costs associated with manufacturing and GLP toxicology studies, $1.6 million in consulting services to support our research and development and $1.0 million related to other research activities;
•$0.3 million decrease in expenses incurred to advance our DB-020 program, driven primarily by a decrease in clinical activity as a result of reduced enrollment in our clinical program from delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic;
•$2.3 million decrease in personnel-related expenses incurred primarily due to $2.7 million incurred in 2020 associated with severance and retention payouts incurred as part of our restructuring, partially offset by increased research and development headcount in 2021; and
•$8.3 million decrease in other indirect research and development expenses incurred primarily attributable to an increase of $9.0 million in contra-research and development expenses recognized based on progress achieved under the Regeneron Agreement, partially offset by an increase of $0.9 million in third-party costs associated with ongoing research and development efforts. Included in other indirect research and development expenses were $11.0 million and $2.0 million of contra-research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, recognized pursuant to our collaboration agreement with Regeneron.
General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $20.4 million, compared to $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $6.2 million was primarily attributable to the following:
•$4.2 million increase in annual D&O insurance costs, audit fees and other regulatory fees associated with operating as a public company; and
•$1.9 million increase in professional fees, driven primarily by expenses related to consulting and accounting advisory services, as well as an increase in personnel-related costs due to an increase in headcount.
Interest Income
Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 primarily consisted of interest income from our investments in available-for-sale securities.
Other Income, net
Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 primarily consisted of income received from the sale of consumables and other supplies to third parties that we were not using and were not planning to use in the future.
Provision for Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021, was due to the recognition of an income tax expense of $1.8 million related to an uncertain tax position in a foreign jurisdiction and a foreign tax provision.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity and Capital
Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. We have not yet commercialized any of our product candidates, which are in various phases of preclinical and clinical development, and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any products for several years, if at all. Through December 31, 2021, we funded our operations primarily from net proceeds of $219.5 million from the issuance and sale of our convertible preferred stock, $39.9 million from our collaboration agreement with Regeneron and $125.0 million from the issuance and sale of our common stock in our IPO.
Cash Flows
The following table provides information regarding our cash flows for each period presented (in thousands):
Operating Activities
Our cash flows from operating activities are greatly influenced by our use of cash for operating expenses and working capital requirements to support the business. We have historically experienced negative cash flows from operating activities as we invested in developing our pipeline, platform, drug discovery efforts and related infrastructure. The cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges, which are generally attributable to stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and accretion of discounts on available-for-sale securities, as well as changes in components of operating assets and liabilities, which are generally attributable to increased expenses, timing of vendor payments and performance under our collaboration agreement.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities of $43.2 million was primarily due to our net loss of $51.8 million, partially offset by net non-cash expenses of $5.2 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $3.5 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities of $32.7 million was primarily due to our net loss of $39.3 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $2.2 million, partially offset by net non-cash expenses of $4.4 million.
Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in investing activities of $101.0 million was primarily due to purchases of available-for-sale securities of $197.5 million and purchases of property and equipment of $0.8 million, partially offset by maturities of available-for-sale securities of $97.1 million and proceeds from sale of property and equipment of $0.1 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by investing activities of $13.0 million was primarily due to purchases of available-for-sale securities of $26.6 million and purchases of property and equipment of $0.3 million, partially offset by maturities of available-for-sale securities of $13.8 million and proceeds from sale of property and equipment of $0.1 million.
Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities of $152.5 million consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance and sale of common stock, net of cash paid for offering costs, in connection with our IPO of $125.0 million, and proceeds from the issuance and sale of our Series D convertible preferred stock of $27.4 million, net of cash paid for offering costs.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities of $54.9 million consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance and sale of our Series D convertible preferred stock of $54.6 million, net of issuance costs paid, and proceeds from equipment financing of $0.5 million, partially offset by payment of offering costs of $0.2 million related to our IPO completed in February 2021.
Funding Requirements
We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing research and development activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical activities and clinical trials of our product candidates. In addition, we expect to
continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. As a result, we expect to incur substantial operating losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities of $162.3 million. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2021, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2024. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we anticipate.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, and because the extent to which we may enter into collaborations with third parties for the development of our product candidates is unknown, we may incorrectly estimate the timing and amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and development of our product candidates. Our funding requirements and timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:
•the progress, costs and results of our ongoing preclinical development, our planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial of DB-OTO and any future clinical development of DB-OTO;
•the progress, costs and results of clinical development of DB-020, including our ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial;
•the scope, progress, costs and results of preclinical and clinical development for our other product candidates and programs, including AAV.103, AAV.104, AAV.201 and DB-ATO;
•the number of, and development requirements for, other product candidates that we may identify and develop;
•the scope, costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;
•the cost and timing of completion of commercial-scale manufacturing activities;
•the success of our collaboration with Regeneron;
•the payment or receipt of milestones and of other collaboration-based revenues, if any;
•our ability to establish and maintain additional strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such arrangements;
•the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
•the amount and timing of revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
•the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property and proprietary rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims;
•the extent to which we may acquire or in-license other products, product candidates and technologies;
•the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic;
•the ability to receive additional non-dilutive funding, including grants from organizations and foundations; and
•the costs of operating as a public company.
Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for several years, if ever. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funds to achieve our business objectives.
Our expectation with respect to our ability to fund current planned operations is based on estimates that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to management and there can be no assurance that the current operating plan will be achieved in the time frame anticipated by us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned.
Adequate additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We do not have any committed external source of funds, other than amounts we are entitled to under the Regeneron Agreement. As of December 31, 2021, we had $11.4 million of unbilled receivables from Regeneron. This balance reflects $10.0 million for the one-year extension
and $1.4 million representing the remaining unbilled balance of the $10.5 million of reimbursable costs from the Regeneron Agreement. Market volatility resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors could also adversely impact our ability to access capital as and when needed. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock. Additional debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends and may require the issuance of warrants, which could potentially dilute the ownership interests of holders of our common stock.
We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or enter into such agreements when needed, we may have to significantly delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of our product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves or on terms that may not be favorable to us.
Material Cash Requirements
The following discussion summarizes our material cash requirements from contractual and other obligations.
We lease and sublease, as sublessee, building space at 1325 Boylston Street in Boston, Massachusetts. Our operating lease and sublease expire in June 2027 and January 2027, respectively. Our lease and sublease both contain rent escalation provisions over their respective lease terms, and we are obligated to pay our ratable portions of operating expenses and taxes. Our operating lease includes the option to extend the term for a period of five years at the then-market rental rate. Our lease and sublease are secured by letters of credit totaling $1.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we were obligated to make base rent payments totaling $3.5 million, excluding our ratable portions of operating expenses and taxes. Base rent will be subject to annual rent increases between 2% to 3%, thereafter. We are obligated to make cumulative rent payments of $20.3 million over the remaining lease and sublease terms, excluding operating expenses, taxes and the extension term.
Offsetting a portion of our rent obligations, we sublease, as sublessor, a portion of our office and laboratory space to a third-party. The lease term commenced in March 2020 and was to continue for twenty-four months. Annual base rent to be received from the sublessee was $1.1 million for each year during the sublease term. The sublessee is obligated to pay its ratable portion of operating expenses during the sublease term. In May 2021, the sublease was amended to extend the lease term through October 2022. During the extension term, base rent will total $1.7 million.
In August 2019, we entered into a license agreement with The Curators of the University of Missouri, or the University of Missouri, which was amended in February 2021, relating to certain patent rights. Pursuant to the agreement, we agreed to pay a low single-digit royalty on annual net sales of licensed products sold and are obligated to make milestone payments on a licensed-product-by-licensed-product basis totaling up to $0.8 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones and up to $13.1 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain commercial sales milestones. We are also required to pay the University of Missouri a nominal annual license maintenance fee. We can terminate this agreement upon written notice at any time.
In October 2019, we entered into a license agreement with The Regents of the University of California, or UCSF, relating to certain patent rights. Pursuant to the agreement, we agreed to pay UCSF low single-digit royalties on annual net sales of licensed products and services and make contingent milestone payments totaling up to $0.5 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones and up to $5.0 million upon the achievement of certain commercial sales milestones. We are also required to pay UCSF a nominal annual license maintenance fee. We can terminate this agreement upon written notice at any time.
In October 2020, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Florida Research Foundation, Incorporated, or UFRF, related to certain patent rights. Pursuant to the agreement, we have agreed to pay UFRF a low single-digit royalty on annual net sales of licensed products and make contingent milestone payments totaling up to $0.8 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones and up to an additional $11.2 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain commercial sales milestones. We are also required to pay UFRF a nominal annual license maintenance fee. We can terminate this agreement upon written notice at any time.
We have agreements with certain vendors for various services, including services related to preclinical and clinical operations and support, for which we are not contractually able to terminate for convenience and avoid any and all future obligations to the vendors. Certain agreements provide for termination rights subject to termination fees or wind down costs. Under such agreements, we are contractually obligated to make certain payments to vendors to reimburse them for their
unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. The exact amounts of such obligations are dependent on the timing of termination and the exact terms of the relevant agreement and cannot be reasonably estimated.
In addition, we enter into standard indemnification agreements and/or indemnification sections in other agreements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, we agree to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally our business partners. The term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual upon execution of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements cannot be reasonably estimated.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Judgments
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe the following accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements have the most significant level of estimation uncertainty and have and are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. For a more detailed description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Collaboration Agreements
While we account for the Regeneron Agreement in accordance with ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements, we analogize to the guidance under ASC 606, Revenue with contracts from customers, to measure progress under the collaboration over time. We measure progress using a proportional performance measure based on actual research and development costs incurred relative to total estimated research and development costs to be incurred by us under the Regeneron Agreement. We account for the consideration we receive under the Regeneron Agreement as a reduction to research and development expense (contra-research and development expense) in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) based on our progress towards completion of our research activities under the research plan. Actual costs incurred are discussed in more detail below. The unrecognized portion of consideration received under the Regeneron Agreement is recorded as a deferred collaboration liability in our consolidated balance sheets.
The critical estimate in measuring such progress is the estimation of the total costs to complete our remaining obligations under the Regeneron Agreement. This includes a number of estimates and assumptions which contemplate both objective and subjective factors. Primary inputs to the estimate to complete our remaining performance obligations include the estimated costs of internal personnel cost and third-party costs to support research and development activities through IND acceptance of multiple potential targets. We forecast personnel costs based on a fully burdened full-time equivalent, or FTE, rate and the expected FTE required as the research plan progresses. This assumption considers our contractual minimum diligence effort measured based on a minimum number of FTE, actual FTE’s incurred and trends therein that may be indicative of future effort, and forecasted changes in FTE based on the requirements under the research plan as well as any anticipated changes in headcount we expect to experience. We forecast third-party costs to support research and development activities based on the requirements under the research plan, historical experience and negotiated rates with vendors. Finally, we forecast third-party costs related to IND-enabling studies based on historical experience, feedback received from regulators and published, publicly available industry estimates.
Our estimates may vary relative to actual costs incurred for various reasons including number of targets being pursued, changes in scope, feedback from regulators, developments in the science over the term of the research plan and changes in costs for supplies, consumables and other materials needed for the collaboration. We actively monitor these estimates relative to actual costs incurred and update our forecasts when and as necessary. These variances represent changes in estimate and may result in material changes in recognition of contra-research and development expense over the term of the collaboration.
Research and Development Expenses and Related Accruals
Research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including salaries, stock-based compensation and benefits, facilities costs and laboratory supplies, depreciation, manufacturing expenses and external costs of outside vendors engaged to conduct preclinical development activities. Research and development expenses comprise a significant portion of our operating expenses and are a primary input in the measurement of progress under our license and collaboration agreement with Regeneron. All costs associated with research and development activities are expensed as incurred.
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advanced payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of the estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:
•CROs and investigative sites in connection with performing research services, preclinical studies and clinical trials;
•vendors, including research laboratories, in connection with preclinical and clinical development activities; and
•vendors, including CDMOs, related to product manufacturing, development and distribution of preclinical studies and clinical trial materials.
We base the expense recorded related to contract research and manufacturing on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CDMOs and CROs that supply materials and conduct services. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period.
Stock-Based Compensation
We issue stock-based awards to employees, directors and non-employees, generally in the form of stock options and restricted stock awards. We measure all stock-based awards granted to employees, directors and non-employees as stock-based compensation expense at fair value in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718.
We primarily issue stock options and restricted stock awards with service-based vesting conditions. Compensation expense related to awards to employees, directors and non-employees with service-based vesting conditions is recognized on a straight-line basis based on the grant date fair value over the associated requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term. We have no awards with performance or market-based conditions. We recognize forfeitures as they occur.
We classify stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in the same manner in which the award recipient’s salary and related costs are classified or in which the award recipient’s service payments are classified, as applicable.
Fair Value of Stock-Based Awards
We determine the fair value of restricted stock awards in reference to the fair value of our common stock less any applicable purchase price. We estimate the fair value of our stock options granted with service-based conditions using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires inputs of subjective assumptions, including: (i) the expected volatility of
our common stock, (ii) the expected term of the award, (iii) the risk-free interest rate, (iv) expected dividends and (v) the fair value of our common stock. Due to the lack of a public market for the trading of our common stock prior to the completion of our IPO, and a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we base the estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatilities of a representative group of publicly traded guideline companies. For these analyses, we select companies with comparable characteristics and with historical share price information that approximates the expected term of the stock-based awards. We compute the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies’ shares during the equivalent period that approximates the calculated expected term of our stock options. We will continue to apply this method until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available. We estimate the expected term of our stock options granted to employees and directors using the simplified method, whereby the expected term equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. We utilize this method as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have no current plans to pay any dividends on common stock. We have elected to use the expected term for stock options granted to non-employees, using the simplified method, as the basis for the expected term assumption. However, we may elect to use either the contractual term or the expected term for stock options granted to non-employees on an award-by-award basis
Determination of Fair Value of Common Stock
Prior to the completion of our IPO, given the absence of an active market for our common stock, the fair values of the shares of common stock underlying our stock-based awards were determined on each grant date by our board of directors with input from management, considering our most recently available third-party valuations of our common stock and the board of director’s assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the grant date. Historically, these independent third-party valuations of our equity instruments were performed contemporaneously with identified value inflection points. The third-party valuations were prepared in accordance with the framework of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Technical Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, or the Practice Aid. The Practice Aid identifies various available methods for allocating enterprise value across classes and series of capital stock to determine the estimated fair value of common stock at each valuation date.
In addition to considering the results of these third-party valuations, our board of directors considered various objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our equity instruments as of each grant date, which may be later than the most recently available third-party valuation date, including:
•the lack of liquidity of our equity as a private company;
•the prices of our convertible preferred stock sold to outside investors in arm’s length transactions and the rights, preferences and privileges of our convertible preferred stock as compared to those of our common stock, including the liquidation preferences of our convertible preferred stock;
•the progress of our research and development efforts, including the status of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates;
•our stage of development and business strategy and the material risks related to our business and industry;
•the achievement of enterprise milestones, including entering into strategic collaborative and license agreements;
•the valuation of publicly traded companies in the life sciences and biotechnology sectors, as well as recently completed mergers and acquisitions of peer companies;
•any external market conditions affecting the biotechnology industry and trends within the biotechnology industry;
•the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or a sale of our company, given prevailing market conditions; and
•the analysis of initial public offerings and the market performance of similar companies in the biotechnology industry.
For financial statement purposes, we performed common stock valuations at various dates, which resulted in valuation of our common stock of $25.97 per share as of May 25, 2018, $22.26 per share as of June 30, 2019, $2.86 per share as of October 9, 2020, $4.40 per share as of November 12, 2020 and $5.83 per share as of December 11, 2020. There were significant judgments and estimates inherent in these valuations. These judgments and estimates included assumptions regarding our future operating performance, the stage of development of our product candidates, the timing and probability of a potential initial public offering or other liquidity event and the determination of the appropriate valuation methodology at each valuation date. The assumptions underlying these valuations represented management’s best estimates, which involved inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes changed and we used significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different.
Subsequent to the completion of our IPO, it is no longer necessary for our board of directors to estimate the fair value of our common stock in connection with our accounting for granted stock options and restricted stock awards, as the fair value of our common stock is determined based on the trading price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.
Valuation Methodologies
Prior to the completion of our IPO, we used a hybrid of the probability-weighted expected returns method, or PWERM, and the Option Pricing Method, or OPM, when allocating enterprise value to classes of securities.
Under the PWERM, the value of an enterprise, and its underlying common stock are estimated based on an analysis of future values for the enterprise, assuming various outcomes. The value of the common stock is based on the probability-weighted present value of expected future investment returns considering each of the possible outcomes and the rights of each class of equity. The future values of the common stock under the various outcomes are discounted back to the valuation date at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate and then probability weighted to determine the value for the common stock.
The OPM treats common stock and preferred stock as call options on the enterprise’s equity value, with exercise prices based on the liquidation preferences of the preferred stock. Under this method, the common stock has value only if the funds available for distribution to stockholders exceed the value of the liquidation preferences at the time of a liquidity event. The Black-Scholes model is used to price the call option, and the model includes assumptions for the time to liquidity and the volatility of equity value.
The hybrid method is a blend of the PWERM and OPM, estimating the probability-weighted value across multiple scenarios and then using the OPM to estimate the allocation of value within one or more of those scenarios. When using the hybrid method, we assumed three scenarios: an early initial public offering, or IPO, scenario, a late IPO scenario and a remain-private scenario. The IPO scenarios reflect an exit or liquidity event by means of a sale of common stock to the public where the estimated IPO price is based, in part, on a review of recent IPO information of comparable public companies at a similar stage to us at the time of their IPO. The comparable IPO companies considered for these scenarios consisted of biopharmaceutical companies at various stages of development ranging from discovery stage to completion of early-stage clinical trials. Additional comparable IPO companies at similar product development stages in the broader biopharmaceutical industry were also considered. We converted the estimated future value in an IPO to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The equity value for the remain-private scenario was estimated using the discounted cash flow method or by back-solving to the price of recently issued preferred stock. In the remain-private scenario, value is allocated to our equity securities using the OPM. In the OPM, volatility is estimated based on the trading histories of selected guideline public companies. The relative probability of each scenario was determined based on an assessment of then-current market conditions and our expectations as to timing and prospects of an IPO.
Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act, enacted in April 2012. As a result, we may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. In particular, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected not to “opt out” of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard and may do so until such time that we either (1) irrevocably elect to “opt out” of such extended transition period or (2) no longer qualify as an emerging growth company.
We are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
We have reviewed all recently issued accounting pronouncements and have determined that, other than as disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such standards will not have a material impact on our financial statements or do not otherwise apply to our current operations.
