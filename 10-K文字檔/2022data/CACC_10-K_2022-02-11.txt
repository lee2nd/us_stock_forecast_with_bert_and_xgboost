ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Overview
We offer financing programs that enable automobile dealers to sell vehicles to consumers, regardless of their credit history. Our financing programs are offered through a nationwide network of automobile dealers who benefit from sales of vehicles to consumers who otherwise could not obtain financing; from repeat and referral sales generated by these same customers; and from sales to customers responding to advertisements for our financing programs, but who actually end up qualifying for traditional financing.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, consolidated net income was $958.3 million, or $59.52 per diluted share, compared to $421.0 million, or $23.47 per diluted share, for the same period in 2020. The increase in consolidated net income was primarily due to a decrease in provision for credit losses and an increase in finance charges. The decrease in provision for credit losses was primarily due to an improvement in Consumer Loan performance and a decrease in new Consumer Loan assignment volume. The increase in finance charges was primarily due to an increase in the average yield on our Loan portfolio, which was primarily the result of the adoption of the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) accounting standard on January 1, 2020. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2021 included:
•An increase in forecasted collection rates for Consumer Loans assigned in 2017 through 2021, which increased forecasted net cash flows from our loan portfolio by $326.1 million.
•Forecasted profitability per Consumer Loan assignment that exceeded our initial estimate for Consumer Loans assigned in 2021 and significantly exceeded our initial estimates for Consumer Loans assigned in 2018 through 2020.
•A decline in Consumer Loan assignment volume, as unit and dollar volumes declined 21.4% and 13.0%, respectively, as compared to 2020.
•Stock repurchases of approximately 2.9 million shares, which represented 16.8% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the year.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, consolidated net income was $421.0 million, or $23.47 per diluted share, compared to $656.1 million, or $34.57 per diluted share, for the same period in 2019. The decrease in consolidated net income was primarily due to an increase in provision for credit losses primarily due to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2020 included:
•A decrease in forecasted collection rates for Consumer Loans assigned in 2015 through 2019 and an increase in forecasted collection rates for Consumer Loans assigned in 2020, which decreased forecasted net cash flows from our loan portfolio by $46.3 million.
•Forecasted profitability per Consumer Loan assignment that exceeded our initial estimate for Consumer Loans assigned in 2018 and 2019 and significantly exceeded our initial estimates for Consumer Loans assigned in 2020.
•A decline in Consumer Loan assignment volume, as unit and dollar volumes declined 7.5% and 3.5%, respectively, as compared to 2019.
•Stock repurchases of approximately 1.3 million shares, which represented 6.9% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the year.
Critical Success Factors
Critical success factors include our ability to accurately forecast Consumer Loan performance, access capital on acceptable terms, and maintain or grow Consumer Loan volume at the level and on the terms that we anticipate, with an objective to maximize economic profit. Economic profit is a non-GAAP financial measure we use to evaluate our financial results and determine incentive compensation. Economic profit measures how efficiently we utilize our total capital, both debt and equity, and is a function of the return on capital in excess of the cost of capital and the amount of capital invested in the business.
Consumer Loan Metrics
At the time a Consumer Loan is submitted to us for assignment, we forecast future expected cash flows from the Consumer Loan. Based on the amount and timing of these forecasts and expected expense levels, an advance or one-time purchase payment is made to the related Dealer at a price designed to maximize economic profit.
We use a statistical model to estimate the expected collection rate for each Consumer Loan at the time of assignment. We continue to evaluate the expected collection rate of each Consumer Loan subsequent to assignment. Our evaluation becomes more accurate as the Consumer Loans age, as we use actual performance data in our forecast. By comparing our current expected collection rate for each Consumer Loan with the rate we projected at the time of assignment, we are able to assess the accuracy of our initial forecast. The following table compares our forecast of Consumer Loan collection rates as of December 31, 2021, with the forecasts as of December 31, 2020, as of December 31, 2019, and at the time of assignment, segmented by year of assignment:
(1)Represents the total forecasted collections we expect to collect on the Consumer Loans as a percentage of the repayments that we were contractually owed on the Consumer Loans at the time of assignment. Contractual repayments include both principal and interest. Forecasted collection rates are negatively impacted by canceled Consumer Loans as the contractual amount owed is not removed from the denominator for purposes of computing forecasted collection rates in the table.
Consumer Loans assigned in 2012 and 2013 and 2018 through 2020 have yielded forecasted collection results significantly better than our initial estimates, while Consumer Loans assigned in 2015 and 2016 have yielded forecasted collection results significantly worse than our initial estimates. For all other assignment years presented, actual results have been close to our initial estimates.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, forecasted collection rates improved for Consumer Loans assigned in 2017 through 2021 and were generally consistent with expectations at the start of the period for all other assignment years presented.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, forecasted collection rates improved for Consumer Loans assigned in 2020, declined for Consumer Loans assigned in 2015 through 2019 and were generally consistent with expectations at the start of the period for all other assignment years presented.
The changes in forecasted collection rates impacted forecasted net cash flows (forecasted collections less forecasted Dealer Holdback payments) as follows:
During the first quarter of 2020, we reduced our estimate of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio by $206.5 million, or 2.3% of the forecasted net cash flows at the start of the period, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The reduction was comprised of: (1) $44.3 million calculated by our forecasting model, which reflected lower realized collections during the first quarter of 2020 and (2) an additional $162.2 million, which represented our best estimate of the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future net cash flows. Under CECL, changes in the amount and timing of forecasted net cash flows are recorded as a provision for credit losses in the current period. We have continued to apply this adjustment to our forecast through the end of 2021 as it continues to represent our best estimate of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future net cash flows. The COVID-19 pandemic has created conditions that increase the level of uncertainty associated with our estimate of the amount and timing of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio.
The following table presents information on the average Consumer Loan assignment for each of the last 10 years:
(1)Represents the repayments that we were contractually owed on Consumer Loans at the time of assignment, which include both principal and interest.
(2)Represents advances paid to Dealers on Consumer Loans assigned under our Portfolio Program and one-time payments made to Dealers to purchase Consumer Loans assigned under our Purchase Program. Payments of Dealer Holdback and accelerated Dealer Holdback are not included.
Forecasting collection rates accurately at Loan inception is difficult. With this in mind, we establish advance rates that are intended to allow us to achieve acceptable levels of profitability, even if collection rates are less than we initially forecast.
The following table presents forecasted Consumer Loan collection rates, advance rates, the spread (the forecasted collection rate less the advance rate), and the percentage of the forecasted collections that had been realized as of December 31, 2021. All amounts, unless otherwise noted, are presented as a percentage of the initial balance of the Consumer Loan (principal + interest). The table includes both Dealer Loans and Purchased Loans.
(1)Represents advances paid to Dealers on Consumer Loans assigned under our Portfolio Program and one-time payments made to Dealers to purchase Consumer Loans assigned under our Purchase Program as a percentage of the initial balance of the Consumer Loans. Payments of Dealer Holdback and accelerated Dealer Holdback are not included.
(2)Presented as a percentage of total forecasted collections.
The risk of a material change in our forecasted collection rate declines as the Consumer Loans age. For 2017 and prior Consumer Loan assignments, the risk of a material forecast variance is modest, as we have currently realized in excess of 90% of the expected collections. Conversely, the forecasted collection rates for more recent Consumer Loan assignments are less certain as a significant portion of our forecast has not been realized.
The spread between the forecasted collection rate and the advance rate has ranged from 19.8% to 27.5% over the last 10 years. The spread was at the high end of this range in 2012, when the competitive environment was unusually favorable, and much lower during other years (2015 through 2019 and 2021) when competition was more intense. Despite intense competition, the spread in 2020 was higher than other recent years due to Consumer Loan performance, which has exceeded our initial estimates by a significantly greater margin than the other years presented. The decrease in the spread from 2020 to 2021 was primarily the result of the performance of 2020 Consumer Loans, partially offset by a higher initial spread on 2021 Consumer Loans, primarily due to a higher initial forecast on 2021 Consumer Loans.
The following table compares our forecast of Consumer Loan collection rates as of December 31, 2021 with the forecasts at the time of assignment, for Dealer Loans and Purchased Loans separately:
(1) The forecasted collection rates presented for Dealer Loans and Purchased Loans reflect the Consumer Loan classification at the time of assignment. The forecasted collection rates represent the total forecasted collections we expect to collect on the Consumer Loans as a percentage of the repayments that we were contractually owed on the Consumer Loans at the time of assignment. Contractual repayments include both principal and interest. Forecasted collection rates are negatively impacted by canceled Consumer Loans as the contractual amount owed is not removed from the denominator for purposes of computing forecasted collection rates in the table.
The following table presents forecasted Consumer Loan collection rates, advance rates, and the spread (the forecasted collection rate less the advance rate) as of December 31, 2021 for Dealer Loans and Purchased Loans separately. All amounts are presented as a percentage of the initial balance of the Consumer Loan (principal + interest).
(1)The forecasted collection rates and advance rates presented for Dealer Loans and Purchased Loans reflect the Consumer Loan classification at the time of assignment.
(2)Represents advances paid to Dealers on Consumer Loans assigned under our Portfolio Program and one-time payments made to Dealers to purchase Consumer Loans assigned under our Purchase Program as a percentage of the initial balance of the Consumer Loans. Payments of Dealer Holdback and accelerated Dealer Holdback are not included.
Although the advance rate on Purchased Loans is higher as compared to the advance rate on Dealer Loans, Purchased Loans do not require us to pay Dealer Holdback.
The spread on Dealer Loans decreased from 24.6% in 2020 to 21.1% in 2021 primarily as a result of the performance of the 2020 Consumer Loans in our Dealer Loan portfolio, which has significantly exceeded our initial estimates, partially offset by a higher initial spread on 2021 Consumer Loans in our Dealer Loan portfolio, primarily due to a higher initial forecast on 2021 Consumer Loans in our Dealer Loan portfolio. The spread on Purchased Loans decreased from 22.9% in 2020 to 19.4% in 2021 primarily as a result of the performance of the 2020 Consumer Loans in our Purchased Loan portfolio, which has exceeded our initial estimates by a significantly greater margin than those assigned to us in 2021, partially offset by a higher initial spread on 2021 Consumer Loans in our Purchased Loan portfolio, primarily due to a higher initial forecast on 2021 Consumer Loans in our Purchased Loan portfolio.
Access to Capital
Our strategy for accessing capital on acceptable terms needed to maintain and grow the business is to: (1) maintain consistent financial performance; (2) maintain modest financial leverage; and (3) maintain multiple funding sources. Our funded debt to equity ratio was 2.5 to 1 as of December 31, 2021. We currently utilize the following primary forms of debt financing: (1) a revolving secured line of credit; (2) Warehouse facilities; (3) Term ABS financings; and (4) senior notes.
Consumer Loan Volume
The following table summarizes changes in Consumer Loan assignment volume in each of the last three years as compared to the same period in the previous year:
(1)Represents advances paid to Dealers on Consumer Loans assigned under our Portfolio Program and one-time payments made to Dealers to purchase Consumer Loans assigned under our Purchase Program. Payments of Dealer Holdback and accelerated Dealer Holdback are not included.
Consumer Loan assignment volumes depend on a number of factors including (1) the overall demand for our financing programs, (2) the amount of capital available to fund new Loans, and (3) our assessment of the volume that our infrastructure can support. Our pricing strategy is intended to maximize the amount of economic profit we generate, within the confines of capital and infrastructure constraints.
During 2021, unit and dollar volumes decreased 21.4% and 13.0%, respectively, as the number of active Dealers declined 10.1% while average volume per active Dealer decreased 12.3%. We believe that this decline is primarily due to low dealer inventories and elevated used vehicle prices, which we believe are primarily due to the downstream impact of supply chain disruptions in the automotive industry. Dollar volume declined less than unit volume during 2021 due to an increase in the average advance paid per unit. This increase was the result of an increase in the average size of the Consumer Loans assigned primarily due to an increase in the average vehicle selling price.
During 2020, unit and dollar volumes decreased 7.5% and 3.5%, respectively, as the number of active Dealers declined 5.3% while average volume per active Dealer decreased 2.5%. Dollar volume declined less than unit volume during 2020 due to an increase in the average advance paid per unit. This increase was the result of an increase in the average size of the Consumer Loans assigned primarily due to increases in the average vehicle selling price and average initial loan term and an increase in Purchased Loans as a percentage of total unit volume.
The following table summarizes the changes in Consumer Loan unit volume and active Dealers:
(1)Active Dealers are Dealers who have received funding for at least one Consumer Loan during the period.
The following table provides additional information on the changes in Consumer Loan unit volume and active Dealers:
(1)New active Dealers are Dealers who enrolled in our program and have received funding for their first Loan from us during the period.
(2)Attrition is measured according to the following formula: decrease in Consumer Loan unit volume from Dealers who have received funding for at least one Loan during the comparable period of the prior year but did not receive funding for any Loans during the current period divided by prior year comparable period Consumer Loan unit volume.
Consumer Loans are assigned to us as either Dealer Loans through our Portfolio Program or Purchased Loans through our Purchase Program. The following table shows the percentage of Consumer Loans assigned to us under each of the programs for each of the last three years:
(1)Represents advances paid to Dealers on Consumer Loans assigned under our Portfolio Program and one-time payments made to Dealers to purchase Consumer Loans assigned under our Purchase Program. Payments of Dealer Holdback and accelerated Dealer Holdback are not included.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the net Dealer Loans receivable balance was 61.3% and 61.4%, respectively, of the total net Loans receivable balance.
Results of Operations
The following is a discussion of our 2021 and 2020 results of operations and income statement data on a consolidated basis, including year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The net Loan income (finance charge revenue less provision for credit losses expense) that we recognize over the life of a Loan equals the cash we collect from the underlying Consumer Loan less the cash we pay to the Dealer. We believe the economics of our business are best exhibited by recognizing net Loan income on a level-yield basis over the life of the Loan based on expected future net cash flows. We do not believe the CECL methodology we employ under GAAP provides sufficient transparency into the economics of our business due to its asymmetry requiring us to recognize a significant provision for credit losses expense at the time of assignment for contractual net cash flows we never expect to realize and to recognize in subsequent periods finance charge revenue that is significantly in excess of our expected yields. For additional information, see Note 2 and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020
Finance Charges. The increase of $180.2 million, or 11.5%, was primarily the result of an increase in the average yield on our Loan portfolio, as follows:
The following table summarizes the impact each component had on the overall increase in finance charges for the year ended December 31, 2021:
The average yield on our Loan portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased as compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, which requires us to recognize finance charges on new Consumer Loan assignments using effective interest rates based on contractual future net cash flows, which are significantly in excess of our expected yields.
Operating Expenses. The increase of $58.1 million, or 17.8%, was primarily due to:
•An increase in salaries and wages expense of $31.6 million, or 16.9%, comprised of the following:
•An increase in stock-based compensation expense of $18.6 million, due to an increase of $33.7 million related to stock options and a decrease of $15.1 million related to restricted stock and restricted stock units. We recognized $33.7 million of expense in 2021 for stock options granted from December 2020 through August 2021 primarily due to a change in the incentive compensation program for senior management. During the second quarter of 2021, we recognized an $11.5 million reversal of stock-based compensation expense due to the forfeiture of unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units upon the retirement of our former Chief Executive Officer in May 2021. For additional information, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
•An increase of $22.3 million, excluding stock-based compensation and cash-based incentive compensation, related to increases of $12.8 million for our support function, $9.0 million for our servicing function and $0.5 million for our originations function. The increase in our support function was primarily related to a $7.4 million increase related to our information technology department.
•A decrease of $9.3 million in cash-based incentive compensation expense, primarily due to a change in the incentive compensation program for senior management, which eliminated annual cash awards in favor of longer-term equity awards, partially offset by an increase in profit sharing primarily due to an improvement in Company performance measures.
•An increase in general and administrative expense of $30.7 million, or 44.1%, primarily due to an increase in legal expenses, which included a $27.2 million settlement with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to settle and fully resolve the claims asserted against the Company. For additional information, see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Provision for Credit Losses. The decrease of $548.5 million, or 98.5%, was due to decreases in provision for credit losses on forecast changes and provision for credit losses on new Consumer Loan assignments.
We recognize provision for credit losses on new Consumer Loan assignments for contractual net cash flows that are not expected to be realized at the time of assignment. We also recognize provision for credit losses on forecast changes in the amount and timing of expected future net cash flows subsequent to assignment. The following table summarizes the provision for credit losses for each of these components:
The decrease in provision for credit losses related to new Consumer Loan assignments was due to a 21.4% decrease in Consumer Loan assignment unit volume and a decrease in the average provision for credit losses per Consumer Loan assignment primarily due to a higher initial forecast on 2021 Consumer Loan assignments.
The decrease in provision for credit losses related to forecast changes was primarily due to an improvement in Consumer Loan performance. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we increased our estimate of future net cash flows by $326.1 million to reflect improvements in Consumer Loan performance during the period. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we decreased our estimate of future net cash flows by $46.3 million to reflect the estimated long-term impact of COVID-19 on Consumer Loan performance.
Interest. The decrease of $27.8 million, or 14.5%, was primarily due to a decrease in our average cost of debt, as follows:
(1) Includes the unamortized debt discount and excludes deferred debt issuance costs.
The decrease in our average cost of debt was primarily the result of lower interest rates on recently-completed secured financings.
Provision for Income Taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the effective income tax rate increased to 24.0% from 23.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in our state income tax rate and the impact of tax benefits related to our stock-based compensation plan on our effective income tax rate. The increase in our state income tax rate was primarily the result of the settlement of an uncertain tax position for state income taxes during 2020. The impact of tax benefits related to our stock-based compensation plan, which reduce our effective income tax rate, decreased from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income. For additional information, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we review our accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP.
Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and involve a high degree of subjective or complex judgment, and the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce materially different financial results.
Finance Charge Revenue & Allowance for Credit Losses
Nature of Estimates Required. We estimate the amount and timing of future collections and Dealer Holdback payments. These estimates impact Loans receivable and allowance for credit losses on our balance sheet and finance charges and provision for credit losses on our income statement.
Assumptions and Approaches Used. On January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which is known as the current expected credit loss model, or CECL. Prior to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, we accounted for our Loans as loans acquired with significant credit deterioration. For additional information regarding the adoption impact of CECL, see Note 2 and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
We recognize finance charges under the interest method such that revenue is recognized on a level-yield basis over the life of the Loan. We calculate finance charges on a monthly basis by applying the effective interest rate of the Loan to the net carrying amount of the Loan (Loan receivable less the related allowance for credit losses). For Consumer Loans assigned on or subsequent to January 1, 2020, the effective interest rate is based on contractual future net cash flows. For Consumer Loans assigned prior to January 1, 2020, the effective interest rate was determined based on expected future net cash flows.
The outstanding balance of the allowance for credit losses of each Loan represents the amount required to reduce the net carrying amount of Loans (Loans receivable less allowance for credit losses) to the present value of expected future net cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate. Expected future net cash flows for Dealer Loans are comprised of expected future collections on the assigned Consumer Loans, less any expected future Dealer Holdback payments. Expected future net cash flows for Purchased Loans are comprised of expected future collections on the assigned Consumer Loans.
Expected future collections are forecasted for each individual Consumer Loan based on the historical performance of Consumer Loans with similar characteristics, adjusted for recent trends in payment patterns and economic conditions. Our forecast of expected future collections includes estimates for prepayments and post-contractual-term cash flows. Unless the consumer is no longer contractually obligated to pay us, we forecast future collections on each Consumer Loan for a 120 month period after the origination date. Expected future Dealer Holdback payments are forecasted for each individual Dealer based on the expected future collections and current advance balance of each Dealer Loan.
We monitor and evaluate Consumer Loan performance on a monthly basis by comparing our current forecasted collection rates to our initial expectations. We use a statistical model that considers a number of credit quality indicators to estimate the expected collection rate for each Consumer Loan at the time of assignment. The credit quality indicators considered in our model include attributes contained in the consumer’s credit bureau report, data contained in the consumer’s credit application, the structure of the proposed transaction, vehicle information and other factors. We continue to evaluate the expected collection rate of each Consumer Loan subsequent to assignment primarily through the monitoring of consumer payment behavior. Our evaluation becomes more accurate as the Consumer Loans age, as we use actual performance data in our forecast. Since all known, significant credit quality indicators have already been factored into our forecasts and pricing, we are not able to use any specific credit quality indicators to predict or explain variances in actual performance from our initial expectations. Any variances in performance from our initial expectations are the result of Consumer Loans performing differently from historical Consumer Loans with similar characteristics. We periodically adjust our statistical pricing model for new trends that we identify through our evaluation of these forecasted collection rate variances.
During the first quarter of 2020, we reduced our estimate of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio by $206.5 million, or 2.3% of the forecasted net cash flows at the start of the period, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The reduction was comprised of: (1) $44.3 million calculated by our forecasting model, which reflected lower realized collections during the first quarter of 2020 and (2) an additional $162.2 million, which represented our best estimate of the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future net cash flows. Under CECL, changes in the amount and timing of forecasted net cash flows are recorded as a provision for credit losses in the current period. We have continued to apply this adjustment to our forecast through the end of 2021 as it continues to represent our best estimate of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future net cash flows. The COVID-19 pandemic has created conditions that increase the level of uncertainty associated with our estimate of the amount and timing of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio.
Our provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2021, included:
•$365.1 million provision for credit losses on new Consumer Loan assignments, which reduced consolidated net income by $281.1 million, or $17.46 per diluted share; and
•$356.7 million reversal of provision for credit losses on forecast changes related to changes in the amount and timing of expected future net cash flows, which increased consolidated net income by $274.7 million, or $17.06 per diluted share.
Our provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020, included:
•$518.6 million provision for credit losses on new Consumer Loan assignments related to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, which reduced consolidated net income by $399.3 million, or $22.26 per diluted share; and
•$38.3 million provision for credit losses on forecast changes related to changes in the amount and timing of expected future net cash flows, which reduced consolidated net income by $29.5 million, or $1.64 per diluted share.
Key Factors. Variances in the amount and timing of future net cash flows from current estimates could materially impact earnings in future periods. A 1% decline in the forecasted future net cash flows on Loans as of December 31, 2021 would have reduced 2021 net income by approximately $47.5 million.
During periods of economic slowdown or recession, delinquencies, defaults, repossessions and losses may increase on our Consumer Loans, and Consumer Loan prepayments may decline. These periods are also typically accompanied by decreased consumer demand for automobiles and declining values of automobiles securing outstanding Consumer Loans, which weakens collateral coverage and increases the amount of a loss in the event of default. Significant increases in the inventory of used automobiles during periods of economic recession may also depress the prices at which repossessed automobiles may be sold or delay the timing of these sales. Additionally, higher gasoline prices, increased focus on climate-related initiatives and regulation, declining stock market values, unstable real estate values, resets of adjustable rate mortgages to higher interest rates, increasing unemployment levels, general availability of consumer credit or other factors that impact consumer confidence or disposable income could increase loss frequency and decrease consumer demand for automobiles as well as weaken collateral values of automobiles. Because our business is focused on consumers who do not qualify for conventional automobile financing, the actual rates of delinquencies, defaults, repossessions and losses on our Consumer Loans could be higher than those experienced in the general automobile finance industry, and could be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn.
Premiums Earned
Nature of Estimates Required. We estimate the pattern of future claims on vehicle service contracts. These estimates impact accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our balance sheet and premiums earned on our income statement.
Assumptions and Approaches Used. Premiums from the reinsurance of vehicle service contracts are recognized over the life of the policy in proportion to the expected costs of servicing those contracts. Expected costs are determined based on our historical claims experience. In developing our cost expectations, we stratify our historical claims experience into groupings based on contractual term, as this characteristic has led to different patterns of cost incurrence in the past. We will continue to update our analysis of historical costs under the vehicle service contract program as appropriate, including the consideration of other characteristics that may have led to different patterns of cost incurrence, and revise our revenue recognition timing for any changes in the pattern of our expected costs as they are identified.
Key Factors. Variances in the pattern of future claims from our current estimates would impact the timing of premiums recognized in future periods. A 10% change in premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2021 would have affected 2021 net income by approximately $4.6 million.
Contingencies
Nature of Estimates Required. We estimate the likelihood of adverse judgments against us and any resulting damages, fines or statutory penalties owed. These estimates impact accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our balance sheet and are general and administrative expenses on our income statement.
Assumptions and Approaches Used. With assistance from our legal counsel, we determine if the likelihood of an adverse judgment for various claims, litigation and regulatory investigations is remote, reasonably possible, or probable. To the extent we believe an adverse judgment is probable and the amount of the judgment is estimable, we recognize a liability. For information regarding current actions to which we are a party, see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Key Factors. Negative variances in the ultimate disposition of claims and litigation outstanding from current estimates could result in additional expense in future periods.
Uncertain Tax Positions
Nature of Estimates Required. We estimate the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return. These estimates impact income taxes receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our balance sheet and provision for income taxes on our income statement.
Assumptions and Approaches Used. We follow a two-step approach for recognizing uncertain tax positions. First, we evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. Second, for positions that we determine are more-likely-than-not to be sustained, we recognize the tax benefit as the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained. We establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions liability that is comprised of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest. We adjust this liability in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or more information becomes available.
Key Factors. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in future periods could be materially affected.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We need capital to maintain and grow our business. Our primary sources of capital are cash flows from operating activities, collections of Consumer Loans and borrowings under: (1) a revolving secured line of credit; (2) Warehouse facilities; (3) Term ABS financings; and (4) senior notes. There are various restrictive covenants to which we are subject under each financing arrangement and we were in compliance with those covenants as of December 31, 2021. For information regarding these financings and the covenants included in the related documents, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.

As noted above, the amount of the facility will decrease by $35.0 million on June 22, 2022, and will further decrease by $25.0 million on June 22, 2023.
Cash and cash equivalents increased to $23.3 million as of December 31, 2021 from $16.0 million as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 we had $1,532.4 million and $1,419.1 million, respectively, in unused and available lines of credit. Our total balance sheet indebtedness increased to $4,616.3 million as of December 31, 2021 from $4,608.6 million as of December 31, 2020.
A summary of the future material financial obligations requiring repayments as of December 31, 2021 is as follows:
(1)The amounts presented consist solely of principal and do not reflect deferred debt issuance costs of $26.4 million. We are also obligated to make interest payments at the applicable interest rates, as discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. Based on the actual principal amounts outstanding under our revolving secured line of credit, our Warehouse facilities, and our senior notes as of December 31, 2021, the forecasted principal amounts outstanding on all other debt and the actual interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2021, interest is expected to be approximately $106.9 million during 2022; $70.5 million during 2023; and $91.5 million during 2024 and thereafter.
(2)We have contractual obligations to pay Dealer Holdback to our Dealers. Payments of Dealer Holdback are contingent upon the receipt of consumer payments and the repayment of advances. The amounts presented represent our forecast as of December 31, 2021.
(3)A lease liability of $0.5 million is recognized within accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.
(4)Purchase obligations consist primarily of contractual obligations related to our information system and facility needs.
Based upon anticipated cash flows, management believes that cash flows from operations and our various financing alternatives will provide sufficient financing for debt maturities and for future operations. Our ability to borrow funds may be impacted by economic and financial market conditions. If the various financing alternatives were to become limited or unavailable to us, our operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Market Risk
We are exposed primarily to market risks associated with movements in interest rates. Our policies and procedures prohibit the use of financial instruments for speculative purposes. A discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Interest Rate Risk. We rely on various sources of financing, some of which contain floating rates of interest and expose us to risks associated with increases in interest rates. We manage such risk primarily by entering into interest rate cap agreements.
As of December 31, 2021, we had $2.6 million of floating rate debt outstanding on our revolving secured line of credit, without interest rate protection. For every 100-basis-point increase in interest rates on our revolving secured line of credit, annual after-tax earnings would decrease by approximately $0.0 million, assuming we maintain a level amount of floating rate debt.
As of December 31, 2021, we had interest rate cap agreements outstanding to manage the interest rate risk on Warehouse Facility II, Warehouse Facility IV, Warehouse Facility V and Warehouse Facility VIII. However, as of December 31, 2021, there was no floating rate debt outstanding under these facilities.
As of December 31, 2021, we did not have a balance outstanding under Warehouse Facility VI, which does not have interest rate protection.
As of December 31, 2021, we had $100.0 million in floating rate debt outstanding under Term ABS 2021-1, which was covered by an interest rate cap with a cap rate of 5.50% on the underlying benchmark rate. For every 100-basis-point increase in interest rates on Term ABS 2021-1 up to the cap rate of 5.50%, annual after-tax earnings would decrease by approximately $0.8 million, assuming we maintain a level amount of floating rate debt.
