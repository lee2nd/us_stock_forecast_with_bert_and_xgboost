Background Overview
Nocopi Technologies, Inc. develops and markets specialty reactive inks for applications in the large educational and toy products market. We also develop and market technologies for document and product authentication, which we believe can reduce losses caused by fraudulent document reproduction or by product counterfeiting and/or diversion. We derive our revenues primarily from licensing our technologies on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis to licensees who incorporate our technologies into their product offering and from selling products incorporating our technologies to the licensees or to their licensed printers.
Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” and other similar terms means Nocopi Technologies, Inc., a Maryland corporation.
Results of Operations
Our Company’s revenues are derived from (a) royalties paid by licensees of our technologies, (b) fees for the provision of technical services to licensees and (c) from the direct sale of (i) products incorporating our technologies, such as inks, security paper and pressure sensitive labels, and (ii) equipment used to support the application of our technologies, such as ink-jet printing systems. Royalties consist of guaranteed minimum royalties payable by our licensees in certain cases and additional royalties which typically vary with the licensee’s sales or production of products incorporating the licensed technology. Service fees and sales revenues vary directly with the number of units of service or product provided.
Our Company recognizes revenue on its lines of business as follows:
a. License fees for the use of our technology and royalties with guaranteed minimum amounts are recognized at a point in time when the term begins;
b. Product sales are recognized at the time of the transfer of goods to customers at an amount that our Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for these goods, which is at the time of shipment; and
c. Fees for technical services are recognized at the time of the transfer of services to customers at an amount that our Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the services, which is when the service has been rendered.
We believe that, as fixed cost reductions beyond those we have achieved in recent years may not be achievable, our operating results are substantially dependent on revenue levels. Because revenues derived from licenses and royalties carry a much higher gross profit margin than other revenues, operating results are also substantially affected by changes in revenue mix.
Both the absolute amount of our Company’s revenues and the mix among the various sources of revenue are subject to substantial fluctuation. We have a relatively small number of substantial customers rather than a large number of small customers. Accordingly, changes in the revenue received from a significant customer can have a substantial effect on our Company’s total revenue, revenue mix and overall financial performance. Such changes may result from a substantial customer’s product development delays, engineering changes, changes in product marketing strategies, production requirements and the like. We cannot predict whether COVID-19 will materially affect our licensing fees or the demand for our products in 2022 and beyond. In addition, certain customers have, from time to time, sought to renegotiate certain provisions of their license agreements and, when our Company agrees to revise such terms, revenues from the customer may be affected.
Comparison of the Years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Revenues for 2021 were $1,951,900, a decrease of approximately 27%, or $706,800, from $2,658,700 in 2020.
Licenses, royalties and fees increased in 2021 by approximately 9%, or $65,900, to $809,900 from $744,000 in 2020. The increase in licenses, royalties and fees in 2021 compared to 2020 is due primarily to higher royalties from our Company’s licensees in the entertainment and toy products market due to ongoing strong retail demand for these products offset in part by lower revenues from our licensees in the security markets. We cannot assure you that the marketing and product development activities of our Company’s licensees or other businesses in the entertainment and toy products market will produce a significant increase in revenues for our Company, nor can the timing of any potential revenue increases be predicted, particularly given the uncertain economic conditions being experienced worldwide as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that is continuing to negatively impact all worldwide economies along with the massive international supply chain disruptions currently being experienced. The products marketed by the Company’s major licensees in the entertainment and toy products markets are produced in China. Trans-Pacific ocean shipping has been negatively affected by container shortages and port delays both in the United States and China.
Product and other sales decreased by $772,700, or approximately 40%, to $1,142,000 in 2021 from $1,914,700 in 2020. The lower level of ink sales in 2021 compared to 2020 is due primarily to lower ink requirements of the third party authorized printers used by two of our Company’s major licensees in the entertainment and toy products market. Sales of ink to the licensed printers of its licensees in the entertainment and toy products market were approximately $751,500 lower in 2021 compared to 2020. Sales of security ink to our Company’s licensees in the retail receipt and document fraud market decreased by approximately $12,900 in 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to reduced demand related to COVID-19 closures of retail outlets commencing in 2020 and continuing during 2021.
Our Company derived $1,758,200, or approximately 90% of total revenues, from licensees and their licensed printers in the entertainment and toy products market in 2021 compared to $2,419,000, or approximately 91% of total revenues, in 2020. The decrease in revenues from our licensees and their authorized printers in the entertainment and toy products market in 2021 compared to 2020 is due primarily to lower ink sales to the authorized printers of our Company’s licensees in the entertainment and toy products market in 2021 compared to 2020 offset in part by higher licensing revenue in 2021 compared to 2020 from one licensee in the entertainment and toy products market. Our Company’s licensees in the entertainment and toy products market continue to develop new products for this market and improve their current offerings; however, their sales will be affected by marketplace reaction to the new and improved products, economic conditions that influence this market segment and the economy as a whole. Revenues that the Company derives from these licensees will be similarly affected. We cannot assure you that the marketing and product development activities of licensees in the entertainment and toy products market will produce increased revenues for the Company in future periods, nor can the timing of any potential revenue increases be predicted, particularly given the uncertain economic conditions currently being experienced worldwide as a result of COVID-19 and its variants including the Omicron variant identified in 2021 and the newly identified BA.2 variant.
Our Company’s gross profit decreased to $1,213,800, or approximately 62% of revenues, in 2021 from $1,535,000, or approximately 58% of revenues, in 2020. The lower gross profit in 2021 compared to 2020 results primarily from lower gross revenues from product and other sales offset in part by higher licenses, royalties and fees in 2021 compared 2020.
Licenses, royalties and fees have historically carried a higher gross profit than product sales, which generally consist of supplies or other manufactured products that incorporate the Company’s technologies or equipment used to support the application of its technologies. These items (except for inks which are manufactured by our Company) are generally purchased from third-party vendors and resold to the end-user or licensee and carry a lower gross profit than licenses, royalties and fees. The lower gross profit in 2021 compared to 2020 reflects lower gross revenues from product and other sales offset in part by higher gross revenues from licenses, royalties and fees in 2021 compared to 2020.
As the variable component of cost of revenues related to licenses, royalties and fees is a low percentage of these revenues and the fixed component is not substantial, period to period changes in revenues from licenses, royalties and fees can significantly affect both gross profit from licenses, royalties and fees as well as overall gross profit. Due primarily to the higher revenues from licenses, royalties and fees in 2021 compared to 2020, the gross profit from licenses, royalties and fees increased to approximately 79% of revenues from licenses, royalties and fees in 2021 from approximately 70% in 2020.
The gross profit, expressed as a percentage of revenues, of product and other sales is dependent on both the overall sales volumes of product and other sales and on the mix of the specific goods produced and/or sold. The gross profit from product and other sales decreased to approximately 50% of revenues in 2021 compared to approximately 53% of revenues 2020. The decrease in gross profit in 2021 compared to 2020 is due primarily to significantly lower ink shipments to the third party authorized printer used by one of our Company’s major licensees in the entertainment and toy products market offset in part by (a) a decline in the cost of certain raw materials utilized by the Company in the manufacture of certain of its products as prices of these raw materials that had increased in 2020 due to the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the availability and supply of these raw materials have been at least temporarily eased in 2021, and (b) a favorable mix of products sold whereby the purchases of the Company’s products by the licensed printers of its licensees in the entertainment and toy products market in 2021 compared to 2020 were of higher margin products manufactured by the Company.
Research and development expenses were $181,500 in 2021 compared to $173,500 in 2020. The increase in 2021 compared to 2020 resulted primarily from product development expense in 2021 compared to 2020.
Sales and marketing expenses were $287,700 in 2021 compared to $356,400 in 2020. The decrease in 2021 compared to 2020 is due primarily to lower commission expense on the lower level of revenues in 2021 compared to 2020.
General and administrative expenses increased to $719,400 in 2021 from $526,100 in 2020. The increase in 2021 compared to 2020 is due primarily to significantly higher legal expenses in 2021 compared to 2020 offset in part by lower corporate relations expenses in 2021 compared to 2020.
Other income (expenses) in 2020 included interest on convertible debentures that were held by seven investors and interest income on invested funds.
Income taxes in 2021 and 2020 resulted from limitations placed on income tax net operating loss deductions by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Our lower net income of $49,400 in 2021 compared to net income of $508,000 in 2020 resulted primarily from a lower gross profit on a lower level of product and other sales and higher operating expenses in 2021 compared to 2020.
Our management does not believe that inflation and changing prices, with the exception of increases in the prices of certain raw materials that were most affected by shortages created by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, have had a significant effect on our revenues and results of operations during the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.
Plan of Operation, Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our Company’s cash increased to $1,846,700 at December 31, 2021 from $1,362,800 at December 31, 2020. During 2021, our Company generated $512,700 from its operating activities, received $2,800 upon the exercise of warrants and used $31,600 for capital expenditures.
Our Company’s revenues decreased approximately 27% to $1,951,900 in 2021 from $2,658,700 in 2020 primarily as a result of lower sales of ink to the authorized printers of our Company’s licensees in the entertainment and toy products market and lower revenues from licensees in the anti-counterfeiting and anti-diversion technologies and products market reflecting the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on this market offset in part by higher royalty revenues from a licensee in the entertainment and toy products market. Our Company’s gross profit decreased approximately 21% to $1,213,800 in 2021 from $1,535,000 in 2020 primarily as a result of lower sales of ink to the licensed printers of our licensees in the entertainment and toy products market and to licensees in the anti-counterfeiting and anti-diversion technologies and products market.
Our Company’s total overhead expenses increased in 2021 compared to 2020, our Company’s net interest income increased in 2021 compared to 2020 and our Company’s income tax expense increased in 2021 compared to 2020. As a result of these factors, our Company generated net income of $49,400 in 2021 compared to $508,400 in 2020. Our Company had positive operating cash flow of $512,700 in 2021. At December 31, 2021, our Company had working capital of $3,197,500 and stockholders’ equity of $3,505,300. For the full year of 2020, our Company had net income of $508,400 and had positive operating cash flow of $702,400. At December 31, 2020, our Company had working capital of $2,801,100 and stockholders’ equity of $3,453,100.
In November 2018, our Company negotiated a $150,000 revolving line of credit (“Line of Credit”) with a bank to provide a source of working capital, if required. The Line of Credit is secured by all the assets of our Company and bears interest at the bank’s prime rate for a period of one year and its prime rate plus 1.5% thereafter. The Line of Credit is subject to an annual review and quiet period. There have been no borrowings under the Line of Credit since its inception. We may need to obtain additional capital in the future to further support the working capital requirements associated with our existing revenue base and to develop new revenue sources. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining such additional capital, if needed. We continue to maintain a cost containment program including curtailment, where possible, of discretionary research and development and sales and marketing expenses. Our plan of operation for the twelve months beginning with the date of this annual report consists of concentrating available human and financial resources to continue to capitalize on the specific business relationships our Company has developed in the entertainment and toy products market. This includes two licensees that have been marketing products incorporating the Company’s technologies since 2012. These two licensees maintain a significant presence in the entertainment and toy products market and are well known and highly regarded participants in this market. We anticipate that these two licensees will expand their current offerings that incorporate our technologies and will introduce and market new products that will incorporate our technologies available to them under their license agreements with our Company. We will continue to develop various applications for these licensees. We also plan to expand our licensee base in the entertainment and toy market. We currently have additional licensees marketing or developing products incorporating our technologies in certain geographic and niche markets of the overall entertainment and toy products market.
Our Company maintains its presence in the retail loss prevention market and believes that revenue growth in this market can be achieved through increased security ink sales to its licensees in this market. We will continue to adjust our production and technical staff as necessary and, subject to available financial resources, invest in capital equipment needed to support potential growth in ink production requirements beyond our current capacity. Additionally, we will pursue opportunities to market our current technologies in specific security and non-security markets. There can be no assurances that these efforts will enable our Company to generate additional revenues and positive cash flow.
Our Company has received, and may in the future seek, additional capital in the form of debt, equity or both, to support our working capital requirements and to provide funding for other business opportunities. Beyond the Line of Credit, we cannot assure you that if we require additional capital, that we will be successful in obtaining such additional capital, or that such additional capital, if obtained, will enable our Company to generate additional revenues and positive cash flow.
As previously stated, we generate a significant portion of our total revenues from licensees in the entertainment and toy products market. These licensees generally sell their products through retail outlets. In the future, such sales may be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending that may occur as a result of an uncertain economic environment in 2022 and beyond due to the COVID-19 virus and its effect on the global economy being experienced worldwide as a result of COVID-19 and its variants including the Omicron variant identified in late 2021 and the newly identified BA.2 variant. As a result, our revenues, results of operations and liquidity may be negatively impacted.
Contractual Obligations
We conduct our operations in leased facilities under a non-cancelable operating lease expiring in 2024. Future minimum lease payments under this operating lease at December 31, 2021 are: $54,600 - 2022; $56,200 - 2023 and $18,900 - 2024. Total rental expense under operating leases was $53,300 in each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
As of December 31, 2021, there were no recently adopted accounting standards that had a material effect on our Company’s financial statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendments in this Update affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, and any other financial assets that have the contractual right to receive cash. The ASU requires an entity to recognize expected credit losses rather than incurred losses for financial assets. For public entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU No. 2019-10 extends the effective dates for two years for smaller reporting companies and nonpublic companies.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. The amendments in this Update affect entities that issue convertible instruments and/or contracts in an entity’s own equity. For convertible instruments, the instruments primarily affected are those issued with beneficial conversion features or cash conversion features because the accounting models for those specific features are removed. However, all entities that issue convertible instruments are affected by the amendments to the disclosure requirements in this Update. For contracts in an entity’s own equity, the contracts primarily affected are freestanding instruments and embedded features that are accounted for as derivatives under the current guidance because of failure to meet the settlement conditions of the derivatives scope exception related to certain requirements of the settlement assessment. The Board simplified the settlement assessment by removing the requirements (1) to consider whether the contract would be settled in registered shares, (2) to consider whether collateral is required to be posted, and (3) to assess shareholder rights. Those amendments also affect the assessment of whether an embedded conversion feature in a convertible instrument qualifies for the derivatives scope exception. Additionally, the amendments in this Update affect the diluted EPS calculation for instruments that may be settled in cash or shares and for convertible instruments. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities that meet the definition of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filer, excluding entities eligible to be smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Board specified that an entity should adopt the guidance as of the beginning of its annual fiscal year. The Board decided to allow entities to adopt the guidance through either a modified retrospective method of transition or a fully retrospective method of transition.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
