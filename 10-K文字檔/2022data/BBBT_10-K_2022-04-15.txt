Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Effects of COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic had a discernable short-term negative impact on the ability of our company to obtain capital needed to accelerate the development of our business, as well as to obtain needed inventory, due to supply chain delays. While these limitations have eased, we are unable to predict when such limitations will be entirely resolved.
Overall, our company is not of a size that required us to implement “company-wide” policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, our product manufacturing operations have experienced no negative consequences attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, inasmuch as these operations involve a limited number of persons.
For purposes of the discussion below, except where otherwise indicated, the descriptions of our business, our strategies, our risk factors and any other forward-looking statements, including regarding us, our business and the market generally, do not reflect the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or our responses thereto.
Basis of Presentation
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section includes financial results of our company, Black Bird Biotech, Inc., including its subsidiaries, Black Bird Potentials Inc. (BB Potentials), Big Sky American Dist., LLC (Big Sky American) and Black Bird Hemp Manager, LLC, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Cautionary Statement
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes, beginning on page of this Offering Circular.
Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in the following discussion, as a result of a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those described herein under “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” We assume no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements included herein.
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:
·
have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
·
comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);
·
submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay” and “say-on-frequency;” and
·
disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO’s compensation to median employee compensation.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
We will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.
Critical Accounting Policies
Change in Accounting Principle. In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06-Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging- Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)-Accounting For Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. The ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for it. The ASU also simplifies the diluted net income per share calculation in certain areas. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2021, and early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Our company has early-adopted ASU 2020-06 for the year beginning January 1, 2021.
Overview and Outlook
With the acquisition of BB Potentials effective January 1, 2020, BB Potentials’ operations became the operations of our company.
Through BB Potentials, our company is the exclusive worldwide manufacturer and distributor of MiteXstream, an EPA-registered plant-based biopesticide (EPA Reg. No. 95366-1) effective in the eradication of mites and similar pests, including spider mites, a pest that destroys crops, especially cannabis, hops, coffee, and house plants, as well as molds and mildew. Also through BB Potentials, we manufacture and sell CBD products, including CBD Oils, gummies and pet treats, and CBD-infused personal care products, under the Grizzly Creek Naturals brand name. Big Sky American distributes our Grizzly Creek Naturals products, as well as an array of other consumer retail products, in Western Montana. In addition, for 2020 and 2021, BB Potentials was a licensed grower of industrial hemp under the Montana Hemp Pilot Program and, in connection therewith, established “Black Bird American Hemp” as the brand name under which these efforts were to be conducted. For the foreseeable future, we have suspended our hemp-related efforts.
Principal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance
Following our acquisition of BB Potentials, our future operating results can be expected to be primarily affected by the following factors:
·
our ability to establish and maintain the value proposition of our MiteXstream biopesticide, vis-a-vis other available pest control products;
·
our ability to generate sales channels for MiteXstream; and
·
our ability to contain our operating costs.
Recent Developments
Spire+. In March 2022, our company launched the first major initiative in marketing our MiteXstream biopesticide on a national basis, when we entered into a consulting agreement with Spire+, a Cornelius, North Carolina-based leading sales and marketing agency that specializes in brand building, marketing, communications and business development. Spire+ has begun work to implement a comprehensive go-to-market strategy for MiteXstream, including e-commerce, traditional retail and a category-specific distribution model. Spire+, an affiliate of Spire Sports + Entertainment, LLC, has a long history of building and executing successful sales and marketing programs for brands, such as Toyota, 5-hour ENERGY, Auto-Owners Insurance, ENEOS Motor Oil, Petro-Canada, STP and Parker Hannifin.
New Sales Executive Officer. Following our executing the agreement with Spire+, in April 2022, we hired William J. LoBell to serve as our Executive Vice President of Sales and Development. In addition to working directly with Spire+ to expand sales of MiteXstream, Mr. LoBell seeks to establish additional sales channels for the biopesticide product. (See Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance).
Results of Operations
Years Ended December 31, 2021 (“Fiscal 2021”) and 2020 (“Fiscal 2020”). Our purchase of certain distribution-related assets pursuant to the Big Sky APA was made with an expectation that an immediately accessible larger number of retail locations would allow us to increase more quickly sales of our CBD products. Big Sky American, since beginning its consumer product distribution operations in Northwest Montana in April 2021, has had a positive impact on our operating results, when compared to our prior operating results. However, our anticipated increase in sales of our CBD products has not yet occurred. Rather, sales of non-CBD consumer products, in large measure, accounted for the overall increase in our product sales for Fiscal 2021. During Fiscal 2021, sales of MiteXstream were insignificant.
During Fiscal 2021, our business operations generated $104,458 in revenues from sales with a cost of goods sold of $84,871, resulting in a gross profit of $19,587. During Fiscal 2020, our business operations generated $57,604 in revenues with a cost of goods sold of $28,245, resulting in a gross profit of $29,359.
During Fiscal 2021, we incurred operating expenses of $1,549,061, which were comprised of $725,240 in consulting services ($573,348 of which was paid by the issuance of common stock), $12,328 in website expenses, $84,457 in legal and professional services, $10,320 in rent, $5,234 in advertising and marketing expense and $601,825 in general and administrative expense, resulting in a net operating loss of $1,529,474. In addition, we incurred interest expense of $281,828, resulting in a net loss for Fiscal 2021 of $1,811,302.
During Fiscal 2020, we incurred operating expenses of $714,162, which were comprised of $266,640 in consulting services ($23,000 of which was paid by the issuance of common stock), $17,899 in website expenses, $143,310 in legal and professional services, $23,280 for product license, $17,200 in rent, $1,918 in advertising and marketing expense, $4,461 in bad debt expense, $29,788 in beneficial conversion expense and $209,666 in general and administrative expense, resulting in a net operating loss of $690,158. In addition, we incurred net other expense of $5,355, resulting in a net loss for Fiscal 2020 of $684,803.
We expect that our revenues will increase from quarter to quarter beginning with the third quarter of 2022, as sales of MiteXstream are expected to increase from our recently-initiated marketing efforts. There is no assurance that such will be the case, and we expect to incur operating losses through at least December 31, 2022. Further, because of our relative current lack of capital and the current lack of brand name awareness of MiteXstream, we cannot predict the levels of our future revenues.
Further, because of our relative current lack of capital and the current lack of brand name awareness of MiteXstream and Grizzly Creek Naturals, we cannot predict the levels of our future revenues. However, our management believes that MiteXstream will become the most dynamic, fastest growing part of our business.
Plans for 2022
Substantially all of our available capital, financial and human, will be devoted to increasing sales of MiteXstream. Through our agreement with Spire+, we will implement a comprehensive go-to-market strategy for MiteXstream, including e-commerce, traditional retail and a category-specific distribution model. In addition, our internal efforts will be focused on developing sales channels outside the scope of the Spire+ efforts. There is no assurance that we will be successful in increasing sales of MiteXstream.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2021, our company had $499,766 in cash and working capital of $574,165, compared to $52,974 in cash and working capital of $7,609 at December 31, 2020. The significant change in our working capital position from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021, is attributable primarily to $1,711,150 in proceeds from sales of our common stock in the Reg A #1 and the Reg A #2 remaining after our repayment of $914,000 in debt and the payment of operating expenses.
Capital Sources. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we derived capital from sales of our common stock and from loans. Our capital sources are described below.

During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, advances of $772 and $6,670 were received from Astonia LLC.

Our company’s current cash position of approximately $100,000 is not adequate for our company to maintain its present level of operations through the remainder 2022. However, we must obtain additional capital from third parties to implement our full business plans. There is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such additional capital.
Transactions Relating to the BB Potentials Acquisition. In connection with our acquisition of BB Potentials in January 2020, we consummated a stock cancellation agreement with a related party and three separate debt forgiveness agreements with related parties, as follows:
Stock Cancellation Agreement. We entered into this agreement with our former majority shareholder, EFT Holdings, Inc., whereby we cancelled all 79,265,000 shares of common stock then owned by EFT Holdings, Inc. The total stated capital and additional paid-in capital associated with such shares is $79,265 (unaudited), and is a reduction of our shareholders’ equity.
Debt Forgiveness Agreements. We entered into three separate debt forgiveness agreements with related parties:
EFT Holdings, Inc. We issued 18,221,906 shares of common stock to our former majority shareholder, EFT Holdings, Inc., in payment of $886,108 of indebtedness, principal and accrued interest.
EF2T, Inc. We issued 2,240,768 shares of common stock to a related party, EF2T, Inc., in payment of $109,992 of indebtedness, principal and accrued interest.

Inflation
Our management believes economic conditions point toward significant inflationary pressures arising in the near future. However, no prediction can be made in this regard and, further, no prediction can be made with respect to how the potential impact any inflation would affect our results of operations.
Seasonality
For the foreseeable future, we expect that our operating results with respect to MiteXstream will be impacted, in an indeterminate measure, by the seasonality of farming operations, including cannabis grow operations. However, we are currently unable to predict the level to which such seasonality will impact our MiteXstream business.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2021, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Contractual Obligations
In May 2020, BB Potentials entered into a facility lease with Grizzly Creek Farms, LLC, an entity owned by one our Directors, Fabian G. Deneault, with respect to approximately 2,000 square feet of manufacturing space located in Ronan, Montana. Monthly rent under such lease was $1,500 and the initial term of such lease expired in December 2025. This lease was terminated effective April 1, 2021. Since such date, Mr. Deneault permits BB Potentials to utilize the previously-leased facility for storage, at no charge.
The following sets forth information concerning the sole operating lease for the facility maintained by us as of the date of this Annual Report.
Capital Expenditures
We made capital expenditures of $185,702 during the year ended December 31, 2021, which included the purchase of distribution assets used by Big Sky American and the purchase of other distribution-related assets. Without obtaining additional capital, we will not be able to make any capital expenditures.
We made no capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2020.
