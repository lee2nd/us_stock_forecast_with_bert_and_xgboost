Explanatory Note
On May 17, 2020, Neurotrope, Inc. (Neurotrope or Parent) announced plans for the complete legal and structural separation of us from Neurotrope, also known as the Spin-Off. Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Neurotrope planned to distribute all of its equity interest in us to Neurotrope’s stockholders. Following the Spin-Off, Neurotrope would not own any equity interest in us, and we would operate independently from Neurotrope. Neurotrope Bioscience, Inc. was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Neurotrope prior to the completion of the Spin-Off on December 7, 2020 (see below for description of Spin-Off). Neurotrope Bioscience, Inc. represented substantially all the business of Neurotrope.
On December 6, 2020, Neurotrope approved the final distribution ratio and holders of record of Neurotrope common stock, Neurotrope preferred stock and certain warrants as of November 30, 2020 received a pro rata distribution at the rate of (i) one share of our Common Stock for every five shares of Neurotrope common stock held, (ii) one share of our Common Stock for every five shares of Neurotrope common stock issuable upon conversion of Neurotrope preferred stock held and (iii) one share of our Common Stock for every five shares of Neurotrope common stock issuable upon exercise of certain Neurotrope warrants held that were entitled to participate in the Spin-Off pursuant to the terms thereof.
Basis of Presentation
The audited financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 include a summary of our significant accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the discussion below and our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report. In the opinion of management, all material adjustments necessary to present fairly the results of operations for such periods have been included in the financial statements. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.
Subsequent to the Spin-Off, our financial statements as of December 31, 2020 and for the period December 7, 2020 to December 30, 2020 are presented on a consolidated basis as we became a standalone public company on December 7, 2020. Our combined financial statements prior to the spin-off were derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Neurotrope, the former Parent. These combined financial statements reflect the historical results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the former Parent’s Spin-Off business which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Neurotrope. Neurotrope Bioscience, Inc. represented substantially all the business of Neurotrope. As a result, the historical financial statements of Synaptogenix are virtually identical to those of Neurotrope, other than capitalization.
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company with product candidates in pre-clinical and clinical development. We began operations in October 2012. We are principally focused on developing a product platform based upon a drug candidate called Bryostatin-1 for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, which is in the clinical testing stage. We are also evaluating Bryostatin-1 for other neurodegenerative or cognitive diseases and dysfunctions, such as Fragile X syndrome, Multiple Sclerosis, and Niemann-Pick Type C disease, which have undergone pre-clinical testing.
Neurotrope had been a party to a technology license and services agreement with the original Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute (which has been known as Cognitive Research Enterprises, Inc. since October 2016), and its affiliate NRV II, LLC, which we collectively refer to herein as “CRE,” pursuant to which we now have an exclusive non-transferable license to certain patents and technologies required to develop our proposed products. We were formed for the primary purpose of commercializing the technologies initially developed by BRNI for therapeutic applications for AD or other cognitive dysfunctions. These technologies have been under development by BRNI since 1999 and, until March 2013, had been financed through funding from a variety of non-investor sources (which include not-for-profit foundations, the NIH, which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and individual philanthropists). From March 2013 forward, development of the licensed technology has been funded principally through us in collaboration with CRE.
Spin-Off from Neurotrope, Inc.
On December 1, 2020, Neurotrope, Petros Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Petros”), PM Merger Sub 1, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petros (“Merger Sub 1”), PN Merger Sub 2, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petros (“Merger Sub 2”), and Metuchen Pharmaceuticals LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Metuchen”), consummated the transactions (the “Mergers”) contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Neurotrope, Petros, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and Metuchen, dated as of May 17, 2020 (the “Original Merger Agreement”), as amended by the First Amendment to the Original Merger Agreement (the “First Amendment”), dated as of July 23, 2020 and the Second Amendment to the Original Merger Agreement, dated as of September 30, 2020 (the “Second Amendment” and, together with the Original Merger Agreement and the First Amendment, the “Merger Agreement”).
As a condition to the Mergers, Neurotrope approved the Spin-Off, which became effective on December 7, 2020, whereby (i) any cash in excess of $20,000,000, subject to adjustment as provided in the Merger Agreement, and all of the operating assets and liabilities of Neurotrope not retained by Neurotrope in connection with the Mergers were contributed to Neurotrope Bioscience, Inc. (now known as Synaptogenix, Inc.), and (ii) holders of record of Neurotrope common stock, Neurotrope preferred stock and certain warrants as of the Spin-Off Record Date received a pro rata distribution at the rate of (i) one share of our Common Stock for every five shares of Neurotrope common stock held, (ii) one share of our Common Stock for every five shares of Neurotrope common stock issuable upon conversion of Neurotrope preferred stock held and (iii) one share of our Common Stock for every five shares of Neurotrope common stock issuable upon exercise of certain Neurotrope warrants held that were entitled to participate in the Spin-Off pursuant to the terms thereof (collectively, the “Distribution”). Any fractional shares were paid in cash.
In addition, in connection with the Spin-Off, the holders of Neurotrope’s amended and restated warrants to purchase shares of Neurotrope common stock (the “A&R Warrants”) received warrants to purchase shares of our Common Stock at the ratio of one share of our Common Stock for every five shares of Neurotrope common stock issuable upon exercise of such A&R Warrants held as of the Spin-Off Record Date (collectively, the “Spin-Off Warrants”).
On December 6, 2020, we entered into the Separation and Distribution Agreement with Neurotrope that sets forth our agreements with Neurotrope regarding the principal transactions necessary to separate us from Neurotrope, including: (i) the contribution of cash in excess of $20,000,000, as adjusted pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and all of the operating assets and liabilities not retained by Neurotrope in connection with the Merger to us and (ii) the Distribution. The Separation and Distribution Agreement also sets forth the other provisions that govern certain aspects of Neurotrope’s relationship with us after the completion of the Spin-Off and provides for the allocation of assets, liabilities and obligations between us and Neurotrope in connection with the Spin-Off.
On December 6, 2020, we entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with Neurotrope (the “Tax Matters Agreement”) that generally governs the parties’ respective rights, responsibilities and obligations after the Spin-Off with respect to taxes. Under the Tax Matters Agreement, Neurotrope will be liable for and shall indemnify us from all taxes of Neurotrope for any taxable period and any transfer taxes for which Neurotrope is responsible as a result of the Spin-Off. We will be liable for and shall indemnify Neurotrope from (i) all taxes, other than transfer taxes of Neurotrope for any pre-Spin-Off tax period to the extent they are attributable to us (ii) all taxes, other than transfer taxes, of us for any taxable period other than a pre-Spin-Off tax period, (iii) from all taxes, other than transfer taxes, of Neurotrope related to the recapture of any “dual consolidated loss” and (iv) any transfer taxes for which it is responsible as a result of the Spin-Off.
On December 7, 2020, we filed an amended and restated certificate of incorporation which, among other things, changed our name to Synaptogenix, Inc. Our Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “SNPX”.
January 2021 Private Placement
On January 21, 2021, we entered into Securities Purchase Agreements (the “Purchase Agreement”) with certain accredited investors (the “Purchasers”) to issue (a) an aggregate of 2,333,884 shares of our Common Stock and/or Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock, (b) Series E Warrants to purchase 2,333,908 shares of Common Stock, with an exercise price of $8.51 per share (subject to adjustment), for a period of twelve months from the date of an effective registration statement and (c) Series F Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,333,908 shares of Common Stock, with an exercise price of $6.90 per share (subject to adjustment), for a period of five years from the date of issuance at a combined purchase price of $6.00 per share of Common Stock and Warrants (the “Offering”). We received total gross proceeds of approximately $14,000,000 in Offering.
In connection with the Purchase Agreement, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the Purchasers (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) on January 21, 2021. Under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, we agreed to register the shares of Common Stock and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and the Pre-Funded Warrants sold to the Purchasers pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. We filed a registration statement on Form S-1 in connection with the Registration Rights Agreement on February 8, 2021. We also agreed to other customary obligations regarding registration, including indemnification and maintenance of the effectiveness of the registration statement.
In connection with the Offering, we paid our Placement Agents (i) a cash fee equal to ten percent (10%) of the gross proceeds from any sale of securities in the Offering sold to Purchasers introduced by the Placement Agent and (ii) warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock equal to ten percent (10%) of the number of shares of Common Stock sold to Purchasers introduced by the Placement Agent, with an exercise price of $6.90 per share and a five-year term.
June 2021 Private Placement
On June 14, 2021, we entered into Securities Purchase Agreements (the “June Purchase Agreement”) with certain accredited investors (the “June Purchasers”) to issue (a) an aggregate of 1,653,281 shares of Common Stock and/or prefunded warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share (the “June Pre-Funded Warrants”) and (b) Series G warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,653,281 shares of Common stock, with an exercise price of $8.51 per share (subject to adjustment), for a period of five years from the date of issuance (the “June Warrants”) at a combined purchase price of $7.547 per share of Common Stock and Warrants (the “June Offering”). We received total gross proceeds of approximately $12.5 million and net proceeds of approximately $11.2 million from the June Offering.
In connection with the June Purchase Agreement, we and the June Purchasers entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the “June Registration Rights Agreement”) on June 14, 2021. Under the terms of the June Registration Rights Agreement, we agreed to register the shares of Common Stock and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the June Warrants and the June Pre-Funded Warrants sold to the Buyers pursuant to the June Purchase Agreement. We filed a registration statement for the resale of such securities on June 24, 2021, and it was declared effective by the SEC on July 6, 2021. We also agreed to other customary obligations regarding registration, including indemnification and maintenance of the effectiveness of the registration statement.
In connection with the June Offering, pursuant to an Engagement Agreement, dated June 14, 2021 (the “June Engagement Agreement”), between the Company and Katalyst Securities LLC (the “June Placement Agent”), we paid the June Placement Agent (i) a cash fee equal to ten percent (10%) of the gross proceeds from the sale of securities in the June Offering sold to June Purchasers introduced by the June Placement Agent and (ii) 152,378 warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock equal to ten percent (10%) of the number of shares of Common Stock sold to June Purchasers introduced by the June Placement Agent, with an exercise price of $7.547 per share and a five-year term (the “June Broker Warrants”). Furthermore, we agreed to pay the June Placement Agent a warrant exercise fee equal to ten percent (10%) of the aggregate exercise price that is paid in connection with each exercise, if any, of the Warrants initially held by Purchasers introduced by the June Placement Agent. The June Placement Agent is also entitled to the foregoing fees with respect to any future financing or capital-raising transaction by us (a “Subsequent Financing”), to the extent such financing or capital is provided to us by investors whom the June Placement Agent had introduced to us, in the event such Subsequent Financing is consummated within eighteen (18) months following the closing of the June Offering.
Reverse Stock Split
At the Special Meeting, the stockholders approved our proposal to effect one reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of Common stock, at any ratio between 1-for-1.5 and 1-for-20, at such time as the Board shall determine, in its sole discretion, before December 31, 2022. On May 19, 2021, we effected a 1-for-4 reverse stock split of our shares of Common Stock. As a result of the reverse stock split, every four (4) shares of our pre-reverse split Common Stock was combined and reclassified into one share of Common Stock. All share and per share information herein has been adjusted to retrospectively reflect this reverse stock split.
Results of Most Recent Confirmatory Phase 2 Clinical Trial
On September 9, 2019, Neurotrope issued a press release announcing that the confirmatory Phase 2 study of Bryostatin-1 in moderate to severe AD did not achieve statistical significance on the primary endpoint, which was changed from baseline to Week 13 in the SIB total score.
An average increase in SIB total score of 1.3 points and 2.1 points was observed for the Bryostatin-1 and placebo groups, respectively, at Week 13. There were multiple secondary outcome measures in this trial, including the changes from baseline at Weeks 5, 9 and 15 in the SIB total score. No statistically significant difference was observed in the change from baseline in SIB total score between the Bryostatin -1 and placebo treatment groups.
The confirmatory Phase 2 multicenter trial was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of Bryostatin-1 as a treatment for cognitive deficits in patients with moderate to severe AD - defined as a MMSE-2 score of 4-15 - who are not currently taking memantine. Patients were randomized 1:1 to be treated with either Bryostatin-1 20μg or placebo, receiving 7 doses over 12 weeks. Patients on memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, were excluded unless they had been discontinued from memantine treatment for a 30-day washout period prior to study enrollment. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in the SIB score between the baseline and week 13. Secondary endpoints included repeated SIB changes from baseline SIB at weeks 5, 9, 13 and 15.
On January 22, 2020, we announced the completion of an additional analysis in connection with the confirmatory Phase 2 study, which examined moderately severe to severe AD patients treated with Bryostatin-1 in the absence of memantine. To adjust for the baseline imbalance observed in the study, a post-hoc analysis was conducted using paired data for individual patients, with each patient as his/her own control. For the pre-specified moderate stratum (i.e., MMSE-2 baseline scores 10-15), the baseline value and the week 13 value were used, resulting in pairs of observations for each patient. The changes from baseline for each patient were calculated and a paired t-test was used to compare the mean change from baseline to week 13 for each patient. A total of 65 patients had both baseline and week 13 values, from which there were 32 patients in the Bryostatin-1 treatment group and 33 patients in the placebo group. There was a statistically significant improvement over baseline (4.8 points) in the mean SIB at week 13 for subjects in the Bryostatin-1 treatment group (32 subjects), paired t-test p < 0.0076, 2-tailed. In the placebo group (33 subjects), there was also a statistically significant increase from baseline in the mean SIB at week 13, for paired t-test p < 0.0144, consistent with the placebo effect seen in the overall 203 study. Although there was a signal of Bryostatin-1’s benefit for the moderately severe stratum, the difference between the Bryostatin-1 and placebo treatment groups was not statistically significant (p=0.2727). As a further test of the robustness of this Moderate Stratum benefit signal, a pre-specified trend analysis (measuring increase of SIB improvement as a function of successive drug doses) was performed on the repeated SIB measures over time (Weeks 0, 5, 9, and 13). These trend analyses showed a significant positive slope of improvement for the treatment groups in the 203 study that was significantly greater than for the placebo group (p<.01).
In connection with the additional analysis, we also announced the approval of a $2.7 million award from the NIH to support an additional Phase 2 clinical study focused on the moderate stratum for which we saw improvement in the 203 study. The grant provides for funds in the first year of approximately $1.0 million and funding in year two of approximately $1.7 million subject to satisfactory progress of the project. We are planning to meet with the FDA to present the totality of the clinical data for Bryostatin-1. We are continuing to determine how to proceed with respect to our current development programs for Bryostatin-1.
On July 23, 2020, we entered into the 2020 Services Agreement with WCT. The 2020 Services Agreement relates to services for our Phase 2 clinical study assessing the safety, tolerability and long-term efficacy of Bryostatin-1 in the treatment of moderately severe AD subjects not receiving memantine treatment. On January 22, 2022, the Company executed a change order with WCT to accelerate trial subject recruitment totaling approximately $1.4 million. In addition, on February 10, 2022, the Company signed an additional agreement with a third-party vendor to assist with the increased trial recruitment retention totaling approximately $1.0 million. The updated total estimated budget for the services, including pass-through costs, is approximately $12.0 million. As previously disclosed, on January 22, 2020, we were granted a $2.7 million award from the NIH, which award is being used to support the 2020 Study, resulting in an estimated net budgeted cost of the 2020 Study to us of $9.3 million. Of the $2.7 million grant, virtually all has been received as of February 22, 2022.
As of December 31, 2021, we incurred cumulative expenses of approximately $6.5 million associated with services provided by WCT and certain pass thru expenses incurred by WCT, which was offset by NIH reimbursements recognized of $2.7 million and, for the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred expenses of approximately $4.6 million associated with services provided by WCT and certain pass thru expenses incurred by WCT, which was offset by NIH reimbursements recognized of $1.7 million. As of February 15, 2022, the NIH has reimbursed us the total grant of approximately $2.7 million for expenses incurred to date.
Other Development Projects
To the extent resources permit, we may pursue development of selected technology platforms with indications related to the treatment of various disorders, including neurodegenerative disorders such as AD, based on our currently licensed technology and/or technologies available from third party licensors or collaborators.
Nemours Agreement
On September 5, 2018, we announced a collaboration with Nemours, a premier U.S. children’s hospital, to initiate a clinical trial in children with Fragile X. In addition to the primary objective of safety and tolerability, measurements will be made of working memory, language and other functional aspects such as anxiety, repetitive behavior, executive functioning, and social behavior. On August 5, 2021, the Company announced its memorandum of understanding with Nemours A.I. DuPont Hospital (“Nemours”) to initiate a clinical trial using Bryostatin-1, under Orphan Drug Status, to treat Fragile X. The Company intends to provide the Bryostatin-1 drug product candidate and obtain the investigational new drug documentation (“IND”) and Nemours intends to provide the clinical site and attendant support for the trial. The Company and Nemours, jointly, will develop the trial protocol. The Company estimates its total trial and IND cost to be approximately $700,000. The Company plans to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial during the first half of 2022.
Cleveland Clinic
On February 23, 2022, the Company announced its collaboration with the Cleveland Clinic to pursue possible treatments for Multiple Sclerosis. The collaboration entails filing an IND and conducting initial clinical trials using Bryostatin-1. Future development work will be conducted pursuant to statements of work to be determined.
Impact of COVID-19
We face the ongoing risk that the coronavirus pandemic may slow the conduct of our current trial. In order to prioritize patient health and that of the investigators at clinical trial sites, we will monitor enrollment of new patients in our Phase 2 clinical trial of Bryostatin-1 for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, some patients may be unwilling to enroll in our trials or be unable to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines or travel restrictions impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. These and other factors outside of our control could delay our ability to conduct clinical trials or release clinical trial results. In addition, the effects of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic may also increase non-trial costs such as insurance premiums, increase the demand for and cost of capital, increase loss of work time from key personnel, and negatively impact our key clinical trial vendors and supplier of API.
In light of the COVID-19 outbreak, the FDA has issued a number of new guidance documents. Specifically, as a result of the potential effect of the COVID-19 outbreak on many clinical trial programs in the US and globally, the FDA issued guidance concerning potential impacts on clinical trial programs, changes that may be necessary to such programs if they proceed, considerations regarding trial suspensions and discontinuations, the potential need to consult with or make submissions to relevant ethics committees, Institutional Review Board (“IRBs”), and the FDA, the use of alternative drug delivery methods, and considerations with respect the outbreak’s impacts on endpoints, data collection, study procedures, and analysis. Such developments may result in delays in our development of Bryostatin-1.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Revenues
We did not generate any revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Operating Expenses
Overview
Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $12,618,307 as compared to $11,156,410 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of approximately 13.1%. The increase in total operating expenses is due to the increase in research and development and general and administrative expenses.
Research and Development Expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred $4,336,414 in research and development expenses as compared to $3,069,034 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of approximately 41.3%. These expenses were incurred pursuant to developing the potential AD therapeutic product, specifically expenses relating to our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial for AD. Of these expenses, for the year ended December 31, 2021, $3,276,465, which includes an expense offset of $1,652,429 reimbursed pursuant to our NIH grant, was incurred principally relating to our current confirmatory clinical trial and related storage of drug product, $299,178 for clinical consulting services, $30,001 of amortization of prepaid licensing fees relating to the Stanford and Mount Sinai license agreements, $60,731 for development of alternative drug supply with Stanford University and $670,039 of non-cash stock options compensation expense as compared to, for the year ended December 31, 2020, $1,884,769, which includes an expense offset of $975,066 reimbursed pursuant to our NIH grant ($127,445 of which was received in the first quarter of 2021), was incurred principally relating to our confirmatory clinical trial and related storage of drug product, $460,353 for clinical consulting services, $29,698 of amortization of prepaid licensing fees relating to the Stanford and Mount Sinai license agreements, $43,108 for development of alternative drug supply with Stanford University and $651,106 of non-cash stock options compensation expense.
We expect our research and development expenses to substantially increase, in the short term, as our current Phase 2 clinical trial for AD was initiated approximately one year ago. Other development expenses might increase, as our resources permit, in order to advance our potential products. We are continuing to determine how to proceed with respect to our other current development programs for Bryostatin-1.
General and Administrative Expenses
We incurred $8,281,893 and $8,087,376 of general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of approximately 2.4%. Of the amounts for the years ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the comparable 2020 period: $1,765,502 was incurred primarily for wages, bonuses, vacation pay, severance, taxes and insurance, versus $1,808,733 for the 2020 comparable period. The decrease is primarily attributable to the termination of our Chief Executive Officer at the end of 2020 partially offset by bonus accrued in 2021 paid in 2022; $662,921 was incurred for legal expenses versus $2,208,968 for the 2020 comparable period. The decrease for 2021 is based upon prior year’s increased fees for one-time work for the planning, restructuring and spin-off of Synaptogenix, Inc. in 2020; $1,567,060 was incurred for outside operations consulting services, versus $1,395,850 for the 2020 comparable period as, for 2021, we incurred additional non-cash expenses associated with warrant issuances for investment banking consulting services; $60,387 was incurred for travel expenses, versus $58,499 for the 2020 comparable period; $301,410 was incurred for investor relations services versus $489,833 for the 2020 comparable period as, for 2020, we incurred additional non-cash expenses; $176,365 was incurred for professional fees associated with auditing, financial, accounting and tax advisory services, versus $278,577 for the 2020 comparable period, which additional expenses during the prior period were incurred for fees associated with our strategic transactions; $705,133 was incurred for insurance, versus $671,292 for the 2020 comparable period, which increase is primarily attributable to an increase in coverage; $430,770 was incurred for utilities, supplies, license fees, filing costs, rent, advertising and other versus $117,944 for the 2020 comparable period, with the increase for 2021 primary attributable to franchise tax expenses of approximately $200,000 and filing fees based upon the Company’s spin-off of approximately $100,000; and $2,612,345 was recorded as non-cash stock options compensation expense versus $1,029,269 for the 2020 comparable period.
Other Income / Expense
We earned $7,110 of interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $153,213 for the year ended December 31, 2020 on funds deposited in interest bearing money market accounts. The decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in money market interest income rates partially offset by higher cash balances for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus 2020. In addition, during the third quarter 2020, the Company recorded a warrant amendment expense of $1.7 million associated with the spin-off transaction discussed above.
Net loss
We incurred losses of $12,611,197 and $12,703,197 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decreased loss was primarily attributable to the decrease in warrant amendment expense mostly offset by an increase in net research and development expenses associated with our current Phase 2 confirmatory clinical trial and general and administrative expenses.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and Working Capital
Since inception, we have incurred negative cash flows from operations. As of December 31, 2021, we had working capital of $33,509,304 as compared to working capital of $5,116,300 as of December 31, 2020. The $28,393,004 increase in working capital was primarily attributable to our January 2021 and June 2021 private placement offering resulting in net cash proceeds from our two private placement offerings of approximately $23.8 million, cash proceeds from warrant exercises of approximately $13.4 million and cash received from NIH of approximately $1.6 million, offset by approximately $9.2 million from operating expenses.
We expect that our current cash and cash equivalents of approximately $32.3 million will be sufficient to support our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months from the Form 10-K filing date, which would include the continuing development and current Phase 2 clinical trial, of Bryostatin-1, our novel drug candidate targeting the activation of PKC epsilon.
We expect to require additional capital in order to initiate, pursue and complete all potential AD clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval of one or more therapeutic candidates. However, additional future funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to access additional funds when needed, we may not be able to initiate, pursue and complete all planned clinical trials or continue the development of our product candidates or we could be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and operations. Any additional equity financing, if available, may not be available on favorable terms, would most likely be significantly dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing, if available, and may involve restrictive covenants. If we are able to access funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own, on terms that are not favorable to us. Our ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, would likely materially harm our business and financial condition.
Sources and Uses of Liquidity
Since inception, we have satisfied our operating cash requirements from transfers of cash from Neurotrope, which was raised by Neurotrope through the private placement of equity securities sold principally to outside investors and through the Company’s two private placements. We expect to continue to incur expenses, resulting in losses and negative cash flows from operations, over at least the next several years as we may continue to develop AD and other therapeutic products. We anticipate that this development may include clinical trials in addition to our current ongoing clinical trial and additional research and development expenditures.
