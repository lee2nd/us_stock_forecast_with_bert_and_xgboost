ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis is intended as a review of significant factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations for the periods indicated. The discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes presented herein. In addition to historical information, the following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ significantly from those expressed, implied or anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed herein and any other periodic reports filed and to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This report and other documents that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. Statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Words such as “expect,” “outlook,” “forecast,” “would,” “could,” “should,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “continue,” “sustain”, “on track”, “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “may,” “assume,” and variations of such words and similar expressions are often used to identify such forward-looking statements, which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward- looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in our reports that we file or furnish with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise.
Business of the Company
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 23, 2010 under the name Verve Ventures, Inc. As of the date of this filing, our name has been changed to Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. On December 7, 2011, we changed our name to American Strategic Minerals Corporation and were engaged in exploration and potential development of uranium and vanadium minerals business. In June 2012, we discontinued our minerals business and began to invest in real estate properties in Southern California. In October 2012, we discontinued our real estate business and we commenced our IP licensing operations, at which time the Company’s name was changed to Marathon Patent Group, Inc. On November 1, 2017, we entered into a merger agreement with Global Bit Ventures, Inc. (“GBV”), which is focused on mining digital assets. We have since purchased our cryptocurrency mining machines and established a data center in Canada to mine digital assets. Following the merger, we intended to add GBV’s existing technical capabilities and digital asset miners and expand our activities in the mining of new digital assets, while at the same time harvesting the value of our remaining IP assets. On June 28, 2018, the board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to allow the Amended Merger Agreement to expire on its current termination date of June 28, 2018 without further negotiation or extension. The Board approved to issue 750,000 shares of our common stock to GBV as a termination fee for cancelling the proposed merger between the two companies. The fair value of the common stocks was $2,850,000.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this management discussion and analysis:
Digital Currencies
Digital currencies are included in current assets in the consolidated balance sheets as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Digital currencies are recorded at cost less impairment.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, which is measured using the quoted price of the digital currency at the time its fair value is being measured. In testing for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that an impairment exists, a quantitative impairment test is not necessary. If the Company concludes otherwise, it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test. To the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted.
At December 31, 2021, we carried $123.2 million of digital assets on our balance sheet, consisting of the approximately 3,321 bitcoins, and held $268.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $2.3 million of digital assets and $141.3 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020, reflecting the shift in our liquid assets. As of March 9, 2022, we held approximately 9,007 bitcoins, of which, 4,794 bitcoins were acquired at an aggregate purchase price of $150 million at an average purchase price of approximately $31,168 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses. We expect to purchase additional bitcoin in future periods, though we may also sell bitcoin in future periods as needed to generate Cash Assets for treasury management purposes.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
Management reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. On January 14, 2021, the Company sold its inventory of approximately 5,900 S9, 13.5 TH/s miners. As such, management determined that those crypto-currency machines were impaired by a total of $871,302 based upon an assessment as of December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019 we moved certain of our bitcoin miners to a new location in the United States and recorded an impairment of $447,776 in our leasehold improvements in Canada.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We are providing supplemental financial measures for (i) non-GAAP income from operations that excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization of fixed assets, impairment losses on mined cryptocurrency, server maintenance contract amortization and stock compensation expense and (ii) non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share that exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization of fixed assets, impairment losses on mined cryptocurrency, change in fair value of warrant liability, server maintenance contract amortization and stock compensation expense, net of withholding taxes. These supplemental financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and, as a result, these supplemental financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to help understand, manage, and evaluate our business performance and to help make operating decisions.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are also useful to investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis. The first supplemental financial measure excludes non-cash operational expenses that we believe are not reflective of our general business performance such as (i) depreciation and amortization of fixed assets, (ii) significant impairment losses on mined cryptocurrency, (iii) server maintenance contract amortization and (iv) stock compensation expense, net of withholding taxes that could vary significantly in comparison to other companies.
The second set of supplemental financial measures excludes the impact of (i) depreciation and amortization of fixed assets, (ii) significant impairment losses on mined cryptocurrency, (iii) change in fair value of warrant liability (iv) server maintenance contract amortization and (v) stock compensation expense, net of withholding taxes. We believe the use of these non-GAAP financial measures can also facilitate comparison of our operating results to those of our competitors.
Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to material limitations as they are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, measurements prepared in accordance with GAAP. For example, we expect that share-based compensation expense, which is excluded from the first two non-GAAP financial measures, will continue to be a significant recurring expense over the coming years and is an important part of the compensation provided to certain employees, officers, and directors. Similarly, we expect that depreciation and amortization of fixed assets will continue to be a recurring expense over the term of the useful life of the assets. We have also excluded impairment losses on mined cryptocurrency from the first two non-GAAP financial measures, which may occur in future periods as a result of our continued holdings of significant amounts of bitcoin. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation and should be read only in conjunction with our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We rely primarily on such Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements to understand, manage, and evaluate our business performance and use the non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally.
The following is a reconciliation of our non-GAAP income from operations for the three months and year ending December 31, 2021, respectively, which excludes the impact of (i) depreciation and amortization of fixed assets (ii) impairment losses on mined cryptocurrency (iii) server maintenance contract amortization and (iv) stock compensation expense, net of withholding taxes, to its most directly comparable GAAP measures for the periods indicated:
The following are reconciliations of our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the three months and year ending December 31, 2021, respectively, in each case excluding the impact of (i) depreciation and amortization of fixed assets (ii) impairment losses on mined cryptocurrency (iii) change in fair value of warrant liability (iv) server maintenance contract amortization and (v) stock compensation expense, net of withholding taxes, to its most directly comparable GAAP measures for the periods indicated:

Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
As reflected in the consolidated financial statements, the Company had and accumulated deficit of approximately $152.2 million, $116.1 million and $105.6 million at December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, a net loss of approximately $36.2 million, $10.4 million and $3.5 million, respectively, and approximately $18.2 million, $7.8 million and $3.3 million net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. At December 31, 2021, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents balances totaled $268.5 million compared to $141.3 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in liquidity is due to the issuance of $747.5 million in convertible notes during 2021.
Net working capital increased by $389.4 million, to working capital of $674.4 million at December 31, 2021 from working capital of $285.0 million at December 31, 2020.
Cash used in operating activities was $18.2 million, $7.8 million and $3.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
Cash used in investing activities was $891.9 million, $81.3 million and cash provided of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
Cash provided by financing activities was $1.037 billion, $229.7 million and $0.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
During 2019, the Company issued 172,126 shares of common stock under the At The Market Offering for the total proceeds of $255,893, net of offering cost of $10,442.
During 2020, the Company issued 54,301,698 shares of common stock under the At The Market Offering for the total proceeds of $307,064,401, net of offering cost of $9,405,129.
On March 30, 2020, the Company issued 350,250 shares of common stock in exchange for S9 miners with a fair market value of $612,938.

Selected short-term and long-term contractual obligations and commitments.
We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents held by us and cash and cash equivalents anticipated to be generated by us are sufficient to meet working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, and contractual obligations for at least the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2021, we held approximately 8,115 bitcoin, including the 4,794 bitcoin held in the investment fund. A total of 4,812.66 bitcoin was purchased and placed into an investment fund in January 2021 for an average price of $31,168 per bitcoin. During 2021, 18 bitcoin were liquidated as needed by the investment manager in order to pay the management fee and other operating expenses of the fund pursuant to the management agreement.
We do not believe we will need to sell any of our bitcoins within the next twelve months to meet our working capital requirements, although we may from time to time sell bitcoins as part of treasury management operations, including to increase our cash balances. The Bitcoin market historically has been characterized by significant volatility in its price, limited liquidity and trading volumes compared to sovereign currencies markets, relative anonymity, a developing regulatory landscape, susceptibility to market abuse and manipulation, and various other risks inherent in its entirely electronic, virtual form and decentralized network. During times of instability in the Bitcoin market, we may not be able to sell our bitcoins at reasonable prices or at all. As a result, our bitcoins are less liquid than our existing cash and cash equivalents and may not be able to serve as a source of liquidity for us to the same extent as cash and cash equivalents. In addition, upon sale of our bitcoin, we may incur additional taxes related to any realized gains or we may incur capital losses as to which the tax deduction may be limited.
