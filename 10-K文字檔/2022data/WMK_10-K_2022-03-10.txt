On January 17, 2019 the Company announced a new pricing strategy for its private brand products named Low, Low Price. The move took the Company’s private brand products from a high, low pricing strategy to everyday low price.
Utilizing its own strategically located distribution center and transportation fleet, Weis Markets self distributes approximately 67% of product with the remaining being supplied by direct store vendors. In addition, the Company has three manufacturing facilities which process milk, ice cream and fresh meat products. The corporate offices are located in Sunbury, PA where the Company was founded in 1912.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) had become a pandemic, and on March 13, the U.S. President declared a National Emergency concerning the disease. This resulted in government mandated shutdowns, as well as multiple legislative acts to provide emergency economic assistance for individuals, families and businesses affected by the novel coronavirus pandemic. These events were accretive to our sales and gross profits compared to the time periods preceding the impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic. The Company is not able to speculate how the ensuing economy or unknown future related expenses will affect it after the governmental novel coronavirus pandemic measures have ended.

Results of Operations
Two-Year Stacked Comparable Store Sales Analysis
Management is providing Comparable Store Sales Two-Year Stacked analysis, a non-GAAP measure, because management believes this metric is useful to investors and analysts. A Comparable Store Sales Two-Year Stacked analysis presents a comparison of results and trends over a longer period of time to demonstrate the effect of the novel coronavirus pandemic on the operating results of the Company. Information presented in the tables below is not intended for use as an alternative to any other measure of performance. It is not recommended that this table be considered a substitute for the Company’s operating results as reported in accordance with GAAP.
Year-over-year and sequential comparisons are the primary calculations used to analyze operating results, however, due to significant fluctuations caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic management believes it is necessary to provide a Two-Year Stacked Comparable Store Sales analysis. The following table provides the two-year stacked comparable store sales, including and excluding fuel, for the fiscal years ended December 25, 2021, and December 26, 2020, as well as fiscal years ended December 26, 2020, and December 28, 2019, respectively.
When calculating the percentage change in comparable store sales, the Company defines a new store to be comparable after it has been in operation for five full fiscal quarters. Relocated stores and stores with expanded square footage are included in comparable store sales since these units are located in existing markets and are open during construction. Planned store dispositions are excluded from the calculation. The Company only includes retail food stores in the calculation.

Net Sales (continued)
According to the latest U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ report, the annual Seasonally Adjusted Food-at-Home Consumer Price Index increased 3.5% in 2021, 3.5% in 2020 and 0.9% in 2019. Even though the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ index rates may be reflective of a trend, it will not necessarily be indicative of the Company’s actual results. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the 52-week average price of gasoline in the Central Atlantic States increased 31.2%, or $0.76 per gallon, in 2021 compared to the 52-week average in 2020. The 52-week average price of gasoline in the Central Atlantic States, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, decreased 12.8%, or $0.36 per gallon, in 2020 compared to the 52-week average in 2019.
Comparable store sales increased for all years presented. On a comparable store sales basis fresh, pharmacy services and fuel increased in sales. The Company’s 2021 sales were favorably impacted as a result of increased pharmacy prescription volume, administering COVID-19 vaccines, and higher fuel sales. Comparable store sales for 2021 compared to 2020 increased 1.7% including fuel and .2% excluding fuel. The Company has provided additional product offerings and customer conveniences such as “Weis 2 Go Online,” currently offered at 187 store locations. “Weis 2 Go Online” allows the customer to order on-line and have their order delivered or pick up their order at an expedient store drive-thru.
The Company has experienced retail inflation and deflation in various commodities for the periods presented. Management cannot accurately measure the full impact of inflation or deflation on retail pricing due to changes in the types of merchandise sold between periods, shifts in customer buying patterns and the fluctuation of competitive factors. In addition, impacts of the novel coronavirus pandemic have caused uncertainty about future economic conditions and may change future product mix. Management remains confident in its ability to generate long-term sales growth in a highly competitive environment, but also understands some competitors have greater financial resources and could use these resources to take measures which could adversely affect the Company’s competitive position.
Cost of Sales and Gross Profit
Cost of sales consists of direct product costs (net of discounts and allowances), net advertising costs, distribution center and transportation costs, as well as manufacturing facility operations. Increased sales volume resulted in an increase in cost of sales. Both direct product cost and distribution cost increase when sales volume increases.
Gross profit rate was 26.4% in 2021, 26.8% in 2020 and 26.5% in 2019. The decrease in gross profit rate is attributable to the increased pharmacy and fuel sales, which have a lower gross profit margin than grocery sales, and higher product and supply chain costs. Pharmacy gross profit margin continues to be pressured by recent changes in industry practices. The Company cannot predict whether the pharmacy industry practices will change favorably.
The Company experienced an unfavorable non-cash LIFO inventory valuation adjustment, decreasing gross profit by $4.0 million in 2021. Favorable non-cash LIFO inventory valuation adjustments increased gross profit by $275 thousand and $5.8 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The Company has experienced retail inflation and deflation in various commodities for the periods presented. Management cannot accurately measure the full impact of inflation or deflation on retail pricing due to changes in the types of merchandise sold between periods, shifts in customer buying patterns and the fluctuation of competitive factors.

Operating, General and Administrative Expenses
The majority of the expenses were driven by increased sales volume.
Employee-related costs such as wages, employer paid taxes, health care benefits and retirement plans, comprise approximately 62.2% of the total “Operating, general and administrative expenses.” As a percent of sales, direct store labor decreased 0.1% in 2021 compared to 2020 and decreased 0.6% in 2020 compared to 2019. While direct store labor expenses increased in 2021 compared to 2020, the sales increases have outpaced the labor expense increase causing the rate to fall, primarily due to the fixed component of store labor. Management continues to monitor store labor efficiencies and develop labor standards to reduce costs while maintaining the Company’s customer service expectations. Currently, the Company is continuing a multi-year initiative to install or upgrade self-checkouts in its stores in response to customer preference and labor supply, including adding convertible dual-use checkout lanes.
The Company’s self-insured health care benefit expenses increased by 0.2% in 2021 compared to 2020 and increased by 9.8% in 2020 compared to 2019.
Depreciation and amortization expense charged to “Operating, general and administrative expenses” was $93.8 million, or 2.2% of net sales, for 2021 compared to $90.2 million, or 2.2% of net sales, for 2020 and $85.2 million, or 2.4% of net sales, for 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense as a percent of sales remained the same in 2021 when compared to 2020 and decreased 0.2% in 2020 when compared to 2019. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for further information regarding the Company’s capital expansion program.
A breakdown of the material increases (decreases) as a percent of sales in "Operating, general and administrative expenses" is as follows:
The Company continues to realize a reduction in workers compensation self-insurance expense as a result a decrease in claims due to improved associate safety programs and claim resolution efforts. The Company is experiencing an increase in subscription and other outside expenses as a result of investing in its information technology.

Provision for Income Taxes
The effective income tax rate was 26.6%, 27.3% and 23.3% in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state taxes as well as nondeductible employee expenses. Not all the Company’s tax credits and state deductions are driven proportionately by taxable income levels, due to these items and the significant increase in taxable income from prior years, the result was a higher effective income tax rate for 2020 and 2021 when compared to 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The primary source of cash is cash flows generated from operations. In addition, the Company has access to a revolving credit agreement entered into on September 1, 2016, and amended on September 29, 2021, with Wells Fargo Bank, NA (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement matures on September 1, 2024 and provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $30.0 million with an additional discretionary amount available of $70.0 million. As of December 25, 2021, the availability under the revolving credit agreement was $25.3 million with $4.7 million of letters of credit outstanding. The letters of credit are maintained primarily to support performance, payment, deposit or surety obligations of the Company. The Company has not had an obligation on the Credit Agreement since the second fiscal quarter of 2018.
The Company’s investment portfolio consists of high-grade bonds with maturity dates between one and 10 years, high grade commercial papers with maturity dates under one year, and three long-held high yield, large capitalized public company equity securities. The portfolio totaled $205.7 million as of December 25, 2021. Management anticipates maintaining the investment portfolio but has the ability to liquidate if needed. See “
