RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021, AND 2020
Substantial positive and negative fluctuations can occur in our business due to a variety of factors, including fluctuations in the economy, and the ability to raise capital. In addition, results of operations, which may fluctuate in the future, may be materially affected by many factors of a national and international nature, including economic and market conditions, currency values, inflation, the availability of capital, the level of volatility of interest rates, the valuation of security positions and investments and legislative and regulatory developments. Our results of operations also may be materially affected by competitive factors and our ability to attract and retain highly skilled individuals.
Our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020 are summarized as follows:
Revenue
Our revenue from operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $101,724 compared to $181,388 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The difference was primarily due to reduced retail sales operations of our prior business that ceased in the first half of 2021. We generated no revenue in the second half of 2021.
Cost of Goods Sold
Our cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $72,839 as compared to $133,030 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The costs of goods consisted of $59,334 in resale products, and $12,719 in commissions, with the remaining $785 in shipping and merchant fees. The difference was primarily due to reduced retail sales operations of our prior business that ceased in the first half of 2021.
Gross Profit
Our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $28,886 as compared to $48,308 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The difference was primarily due to reduced retail sales operations of our prior business that ceased in the first half of 2021.

Our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $483,335 compared to $896,541 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021, of $483,335, consisted of $272,746 of selling, general and administrative expenses, professional fees of $163,445, research and development of $27,416, and amortization expense of $19,729.

Net Operating Loss
Our net operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $601,252 as compared to a net operating loss of $886,335 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had current assets of $852,750, including $840,639 in cash, and current liabilities of $20,308, resulting in a working capital of $832,442.
In February 2021, we commenced a private placement of 1,000,000 units of our securities, at a price of $1.25 per unit. Each unit consists of one share of our common stock and a common stock purchase warrant to purchase one-tenth share of our common stock, over a five-year period, at an exercise price of $1.75 per share. As of the date of this report, 968,000 shares of common stock were issued for gross proceeds of $1,210,000 have been received.
We believe as of the date of this report, we have the working capital on hand, along with our expected cash flow from operations, to fund our current level of operations at least through the end of the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that we will not require additional capital. If we require additional capital, we will seek to obtain additional working capital through the sale of our securities and, if available, bank lines of credit. However, there can be no assurance we will be able to obtain access to capital as and when needed and, if so, the terms of any available financing may not be subject to commercially reasonable terms.
