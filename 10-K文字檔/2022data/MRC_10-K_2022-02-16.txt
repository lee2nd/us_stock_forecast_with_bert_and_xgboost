Overview
We are the leading global distributor of pipe, valves, and fittings ("PVF") and other infrastructure products and services to diversified energy, industrial and gas utility end-markets. We provide innovative supply chain solutions, technical product expertise and a robust digital platform to customers globally through our leading position across each of our diversified end-markets including the following sectors:
● gas utilities (storage and distribution of natural gas)
● downstream, industrial and energy transition (crude oil refining, petrochemical and chemical processing, general industrials and energy transition projects)
● upstream production (exploration, production and extraction of underground oil and gas)
● midstream pipeline (gathering, processing and transmission of oil and gas)
We offer over 250,000 SKUs, including an extensive array of PVF, oilfield supply, valve automation and modification, measurement, instrumentation and other general and specialty products from our global network of over 10,000 suppliers. With over 100 years of history, our over 2,600 employees serve approximately 10,000 customers through approximately 210 service locations including regional distribution centers, service centers, corporate offices and third party pipe yards, where we often deploy pipe near customer locations.
Our customers use the PVF and other infrastructure products that we supply in mission critical process applications that require us to provide a high degree of product knowledge, technical expertise and comprehensive value-added services to our customers. We seek to provide best-in-class service and a one-stop shop for customers by satisfying the most complex, multi- site needs of many of the largest companies in the energy, industrial and gas utilities sectors as their primary PVF supplier. We believe the critical role we play in our customers' supply chain, together with our extensive product and service offerings, broad global presence, customer-linked scalable information systems and efficient distribution capabilities, serve to solidify our long-standing customer relationships and drive our growth. As a result, we have an average relationship of over 25 years with our 25 largest customers.
Key Drivers of Our Business
We derive our revenue predominantly from the sale of PVF and other oilfield and industrial supplies to energy, industrial and gas utility customers globally. Our business is, therefore, dependent upon both the current conditions and future prospects in these industries and, in particular, maintenance and expansionary operating and capital expenditures by our customers in each of our sectors. The outlook for PVF spending is influenced by numerous factors, including the following:
●
Energy Infrastructure Integrity and Modernization. Ongoing maintenance and upgrading of existing energy facilities, pipelines and other infrastructure equipment is a meaningful driver for business across the sectors we serve. This is particularly true for gas utilities, which is currently our largest sector by sales. Activity with customers in this sector is dependent on new residential and commercial development as well as upgrades of existing infrastructure. Maintenance of an aging network of pipelines and local distribution networks is a critical requirement for these customers irrespective of broader economic conditions. As a result, this business tends to be more stable over time and moves independently of commodity prices.
● Oil and Natural Gas Demand and Prices. Sales of PVF and infrastructure products to the oil and natural gas industry constitute a significant portion of our sales. As a result, we depend upon oil and natural gas participants to make maintenance and capital expenditures to explore for, produce and process oil, natural gas and refined products. Demand for oil and natural gas, current and projected commodity prices and the costs necessary to produce oil and gas impact customer capital spending, additions to and maintenance of pipelines, refinery utilization and petrochemical processing activity. Additionally, as these participants rebalance their capital investment away from traditional, carbon-based energy toward alternative sources, we expect to continue to supply them and enhance our product and service offerings to support their changing requirements, including in areas such as carbon capture utilization and storage, biofuels and offshore wind.
●
Economic Conditions. Changes in the general economy or in the energy sector (domestically or internationally) can cause demand for fuels, feedstocks and petroleum-derived products to vary, thereby causing demand for the products we distribute to materially change.
●
Manufacturer and Distributor Inventory Levels of PVF and Related Products. Manufacturer and distributor inventory levels of PVF and related products can change significantly from period to period. Increased inventory levels by manufacturers or other distributors can cause an oversupply of PVF and related products in the industry sectors we serve and reduce the prices that we are able to charge for the products we distribute. Reduced prices, in turn, would likely reduce our profitability. Conversely, decreased manufacturer inventory levels may ultimately lead to increased demand for our products and often result in increased revenue, higher PVF pricing and improved profitability.
●
Steel Prices, Availability and Supply and Demand. Fluctuations in steel prices can lead to volatility in the pricing of the products we distribute, especially carbon steel line pipe products, which can influence the buying patterns of our customers. A majority of the products we distribute contain various types of steel. The worldwide supply and demand for these products and other steel products that we do not supply, impact the pricing and availability of our products and, ultimately, our sales and operating profitability. Additionally, supply chain disruptions with key manufacturers or in markets in which we source products can impact the availability of inventory we require to support our customers. Furthermore, logistical challenges, including inflation and availability of freight providers and containers for shipping can also significantly impact our profitability and inventory lead-times.
Recent Trends and Outlook
We have made significant strides in increasing the diversification of our end markets over the last few years supporting our customers in the gas utilities sector and traditional energy markets, along with other industrial end markets and the rapidly evolving energy transition. For the year ended 2021, 67% of our revenue was derived from our gas utility and downstream, industrial and energy transition ("DIET") sectors, with the remainder in the upstream production and midstream pipeline sectors.
Gas Utilities
Our gas utility business had the most significant contribution to our revenue improvement in 2021 generating $1 billion in revenue, an increase of 21% compared to 2020. This continues to be our largest sector, making up 38% of our total company revenue in 2021. This business, which is largely independent of oil and gas commodity prices, was initially impacted by certain customer activity delays due to COVID-19 concerns but did not experience any material budget cuts or project cancellations. This sector is expected to have continued growth in 2022 due to increased activity levels resulting from integrity upgrade programs as well as new home construction. We currently have contracts with nine of the top ten U.S. gas utility companies, based on meter count. A recent analyst report estimates a low double-digit increase in the capital expenditures of gas utilities for the 3-year forward period of 2021-2023 as compared to the proceeding 3-year period of 2018-2020. Other recent research analyst projections indicate a similar double-digit increase in capital expenditures for our largest gas utility customers in 2022 compared to 2021.
Our gas utilities customers execute multi-year programs where they continually evaluate, monitor and implement measures to improve their pipeline distribution networks, ensuring the safety and the integrity of their system. As of 2020, which is the most recently available information, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) estimates approximately 38% of the gas distribution main and service line miles are over 40 years old or of unknown origin. This infrastructure requires continuous replacement and maintenance as these gas distribution networks continue to age. We supply many of the replacement products including valves, line pipe, smart meters, risers and other gas products. A large percentage of the line pipe we sell is sold to our gas utilities customers for line replacement and new sections of their distribution network. Additionally, as our gas utility customers connect new homes and businesses to their gas distribution network, the growth in the housing market creates new revenue opportunities for our business to supply the related infrastructure products. Notwithstanding that certain states and cities are imposing bans on new natural gas connections in certain new homes and buildings, the growth in housing continues to be supportive of growth in our business as the housing market has been robust, with new housing starts increasing by 15% in 2021 over 2020. The compound annual growth rate since 2010 for this sector is 11% and based on the secular drivers underlying our customers’ businesses, we expect this area of our business to continue to have steady growth for the foreseeable future.
Downstream, Industrial and Energy Transition (DIET)
DIET, our second largest sector, generated 29% of our total company revenue for 2021. Although DIET revenue declined marginally compared to 2020, we have seen meaningful improvements in activity levels as impacts from COVID-19 on maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) and upgrade projects have moderated. This business has historically been less volatile than the upstream and midstream pipeline sectors as it is less commodity price dependent. The revenue allocation is generally evenly split between chemicals, refining and other industrial markets with a relatively stable installed base of facilities and as such, this sector is more weighted to MRO and turnaround project activity. This sector is expected to have growth in 2022 due to increased customer activity levels related to MRO, project turnaround activity and new energy transition related projects, which we began including in this sector’s reporting in the third quarter of 2021.
Recent forecast projections by Industrial Info Resources (IIR) show expected spending, both MRO and projects, for chemical processing companies to increase low double digits in 2022 over 2021. Chemical companies benefit from the low cost, secure feedstock sources, such as that in the U.S. and have invested in building new facilities in recent years and are expected to build others in the future, which will provide us with new opportunities. We created a Downstream Center of Excellence to re-focus our efforts on improving market penetration in this sub-sector and capture more new projects as they are sanctioned. Global GDP is a driver of growth for the chemicals sector, which is expected to expand by 4.4% in 2022 according to the American Chemistry Council. As demand for plastics and other chemicals continues to rise with population growth and improving GDP, our global chemicals business will also continue to grow.
IIR also forecasts petroleum refining spending, both MRO and projects, to increase double digits, in 2022 over 2021. Analysts’ estimates indicate our largest customers intend to increase spending strong double digits in 2022 over 2021. We serve some of the largest refiners in the U.S. and their related infrastructure is aging and requires consistent maintenance with scheduled and unscheduled turnarounds. During the heights of the pandemic, refining utilization declined significantly and much of the scheduled turnarounds were delayed. We started to see improvement in our refining business in the latter part of 2021 as customers increased activity related to necessary turnarounds. However, increased turnaround activity for our customer base is expected in 2022, based on IIR estimates.
While the energy transition portion of our business is relatively small today, the energy transition movement is in early stages of development, and we expect it to grow over the next several years. The outlook for energy transition projects in the coming years is robust, as growing momentum and pressure to decarbonize the economy rises. The regulatory regime in many countries is also pushing this effort with recent regulations such as the EU’s carbon neutrality mandate, among many others. Also, many of our customers have made commitments to net zero emissions and to improve their ESG profile. Our customer base is one of the primary leaders in the energy transition movement and are positioned to lead the effort to decarbonize through nearer-term efforts such as renewable or biodiesel refineries and offshore wind electric generation as well as longer-term efforts such as carbon capture and storage, and hydrogen. These projects will require substantially the same products we currently provide today to these customers. We also sell low-emission valves, which represent 94% of the valves we sell currently. We are well-positioned to grow our energy transition business as we supply products for these projects through our long-standing customer relationships and our product and global supply chain expertise.
Upstream Production and Midstream Pipeline
The upstream production and midstream pipeline sectors of our business are the most cyclical in nature; however, in 2021 these sectors represented only about a third of our company revenues. In 2020, demand for oil and natural gas declined sharply because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This resulted in lower commodity prices, which, in turn, led to a significant decline in oil and gas industry spending, which had a material impact to both the upstream production and midstream pipeline components of our business. However, we have experienced an improvement in the demand for oil and natural gas as the roll out of the COVID-19 vaccinations gradually improved around the globe and pandemic restrictions eased. The increasing optimism related to demand recovery has led to higher commodity prices, which is typically positive for our business. Although demand levels remain below pre-pandemic levels, there continues to be growing confidence of returning to 2019 demand levels as soon as the end of 2022. Demand recovery could still possibly slow or pause as a result of additional waves of pandemic outbreak or heightened pandemic control measures. Over the longer term, we could also experience a structural shift in the global economy and its demand for oil and natural gas as a result of changes in the way people work, travel and interact.
Notwithstanding the ongoing uncertainty, our 2021 revenue recovered from the low point in the fourth quarter of 2020. Revenue in the second half of 2021 trended approximately 17% higher than the second half of 2020 run rate. We are expecting continued growth in all our sectors in 2022. Recent spending plan estimates by sell-side research analysts indicate U.S. upstream spending in 2022 will experience double-digit growth compared to 2021. However, the percentage increases can vary significantly by customer. We expect oil and gas exploration and production operators, particularly the larger public operators that typically represent a significant portion of our upstream revenue to have a continued focus on capital discipline. Additionally, analysts are projecting that North America upstream capital spending in 2022 will be more heavily weighted to drilling activity instead of completions activity. Completions are correlated more closely to our upstream revenues. Furthermore, since the U.S. rig count bottomed in the second quarter of 2020, private operators, who historically have represented a smaller portion of our upstream revenue, have driven the majority of the rig count. As such, our company upstream revenue may trend lower compared to projected market improvements in the U.S. upstream spending estimates.
Longer Term Outlook
In January 2021, the U.S. President took office and a new U.S. Congress was seated. Both have publicly stated a desire to support alternative energy sources such as solar, wind and “green” hydrogen, reduce U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases and generally address climate change. To that end, the new administration has implemented executive orders for the U.S. to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which presumably will require the U.S. to set greenhouse gas reduction goals and enact policies to meet those goals. It has also announced an aggressive policy agenda to change the tax system, increase corporate and other income taxes, modify the relationships between the United States and other countries and make changes that reverse actions taken by the prior President. Congress has made proposals to increase U.S. federal government spending significantly on infrastructure and programs to address climate change and to add new taxes to help pay for these proposals. In November 2021, Congress passed, and the President signed into law, H.R. 3684, the "Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act", the first of these proposals. This act is primarily focused on providing funding for upgrading roads, bridges, public transit, railways, broadband infrastructure and clean water projects. We do not expect this act to have a material impact on our business. As of the date of this filing, other proposals have not yet been enacted. Until specific laws are passed, executive actions are taken, or federal regulatory action is enacted, it is unclear what impact these policies will have on our business. However, we play a critical role in supporting economic growth, particularly in developing countries, and we believe that oil and gas demand will continue to be significant in the coming decades. We are also well-positioned to benefit from increases in new decarbonization infrastructure such as carbon capture, CO2 and hydrogen pipelines as well as offshore wind electric generation.
We play a critical role in supporting our customers and the energy industry throughout the cycles. The U.S. Energy Information Administration's ("EIA") Reference Case published in it's International Energy Outlook 2021 that by 2050 world energy consumption will increase by nearly 50% between 2020 and 2050. Additionally, the EIA projects in its Reference Case renewable energy consumption to grow 15% in 2020 and to 27% in 2050 and natural gas consumption to grow by 31% between 2022 and 2050. This would require an increase in oil and gas to meet the rise in demand from current levels, which would continue to provide a robust market for our existing goods and services. Furthermore, our largest customers are among the leading investors in renewable energy technology. As they further rebalance their capital investment from traditional, carbon-based energy to alternative sources, we expect to continue to supply them and enhance our product and service offering as needed to support their changing requirements.
Supply Chain
As a distribution business, we have also closely monitored the ability of our suppliers and transportation providers to continue the functioning of our supply chain, particularly in cases where there are limited alternative sources of supply. Lead-times for purchases of certain products have extended substantially over the last few quarters and we expect continued disruptions related to both lead-times and logistics for the foreseeable future. We have not experienced significant delays by transportation providers, but we are experiencing significant increases in transportation costs as the economies of the U.S. and other countries recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our inventory position has allowed us to continue supply to most customers with little interruption. In those instances where there is interruption, we work with our customers to limit the impacts on their business and maintain an ongoing dialogue regarding the status of impacted orders. We also continue to monitor the current constrained labor market and related costs.
We have experienced significant inflation this year for certain product categories, especially in carbon steel pipe. Although inflation causes the price we pay for products to increase, we are generally able to leverage long-standing relationships with our suppliers and the high volume of our purchases to achieve market competitive pricing and preferential allocations of limited supplies. In addition, our contracts with customers generally allow us to pass price increases along to customers within a reasonable time after they occur. The imposition and removal of tariffs and quotas also impact pricing on imported product or product components. To the extent further pricing fluctuations impact our products, the impact on our revenue and cost of goods sold, which is determined using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") inventory costing methodology, remains subject to uncertainty and volatility.
COVID-19 Pandemic
We continue to have measures in place to safeguard the health and welfare of our employees, including (among other things) social distancing measures while at work, certain screening, providing personal protection equipment such as face masks and hand sanitizer and providing "deep" cleaning services at Company facilities. If we were to develop a COVID-19 outbreak at one of our facilities, we have plans to isolate those in contact with potentially infected employees and to either staff the facility with employees from other facilities or supply product to customers from other facilities. We monitor guidelines of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control ("CDC") and other authorities on an ongoing basis. As various governmental isolation orders evolve, we continue to review our operational plans to continue operating our business while addressing the health and safety of our employees and those with whom our business comes into contact.
Backlog
We determine backlog by the amount of unshipped customer orders, either specific or general in nature, which the customer may revise or cancel in certain instances. The table below details our backlog by segment (in millions):
There can be no assurance that the backlog amounts will ultimately be realized as revenue or that we will earn a profit on the backlog of orders, but we expect that substantially all of the sales in our backlog will be realized within twelve months.

Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to an equivalent GAAP measure, see pages 33-35 herein.
Sales. Sales reflect consideration we are entitled to for goods and services when control of those goods and services is transferred to our customers. Our sales were $2,666 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $2,560 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $106 million, or 4%, increase included a $30 million favorable impact from the strengthening of foreign currencies in areas where we operate relative to the U.S. dollar.
U.S. Segment-Our U.S. sales increased $155 million to $2,178 million for 2021 from $2,023 million for 2020. This 8% increase reflected a $174 million increase in the gas utilities sector, a $6 million decrease in the DIET sector, a $8 million decrease in the upstream production sector and a $5 million decrease in the midstream pipeline sector. The increase in gas utilities was driven by a new customer contract, pent-up demand from pandemic restriction project delays and infrastructure improvement projects. The remaining sectors declined largely due to the decline in activity during the pandemic, which impacted the first half of 2021.
Canadian Segment-Our Canadian sales increased $4 million to $132 million for 2021 from $128 million for 2020. This 3% increase reflected a $5 million increase in the DIET sector, a $2 million increase in gas utilities, a $1 million decrease in the upstream production sector and a $2 million decrease in the midstream pipeline sector. The increase in the DIET sector and gas utilities was due to projects previously delayed being resumed. The strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar favorably impacted sales by $9 million, or 6%.
International Segment-Our International sales decreased $53 million to $356 million for 2021 from $409 million for 2020. The 13% decrease is primarily driven by non-recurring projects predominantly in the upstream production sector. In addition, the strengthening of foreign currencies in areas where we operate relative to the U.S. dollar favorably impacted sales by $21 million, or 6%.
Gross Profit. Our gross profit was $417 million (15.6% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $431 million (16.8% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $14 million decrease was primarily attributable to charges associated with our last-in first-out ("LIFO") inventory costing methodology offset by increased sales. As compared to average cost, our LIFO inventory costing methodology increased cost of sales by $77 million in 2021 compared to a $19 million decrease in cost of sales in 2020.
Adjusted Gross Profit. Adjusted Gross Profit increased to $537 million (20.1% of sales) for 2021 from $504 million (19.7% of sales) for 2020, an increase of $33 million. The increase was primarily due to improved margins on our line pipe and gas product sales. Adjusted Gross Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted Gross Profit as sales, less cost of sales, plus depreciation and amortization, plus amortization of intangibles, plus inventory-related charges incremental to normal operations and plus or minus the impact of our LIFO inventory costing methodology. We present Adjusted Gross Profit because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance without regard to items, such as amortization of intangibles that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon the nature and extent of acquisitions. Similarly, the impact of the LIFO inventory costing method can cause results to vary substantially from company to company depending upon whether they elect to utilize LIFO and depending upon which method they may elect. We use Adjusted Gross Profit as a key performance indicator in managing our business. We believe that gross profit is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to Adjusted Gross Profit.
The following table reconciles gross profit, as derived from our consolidated financial statements, with Adjusted Gross Profit, a non-GAAP financial measure (in millions):
Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses. Costs such as salaries, wages, employee benefits, rent, utilities, communications, insurance, fuel and taxes (other than state and federal income taxes) that are necessary to operate our service center and corporate operations are included in SG&A. Also contained in this category are certain items that are non-operational in nature, including certain costs of acquiring and integrating other businesses. Our SG&A expenses were $410 million (15.4% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $449 million (17.5% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $39 million decrease in SG&A was driven by effective cost management of employee-related costs, including incentives and benefits. Additionally, we incurred $1 million of severance and restructuring charges and $2 million of charges associated to an employee separation in 2021 as compared to $14 million of expenses associated with facilities closures and $14 million of severance and restructuring charges in 2020. 2020 SG&A was reduced by a $2 million recovery of supplier bad debt. Excluding the impact of these charges, SG&A decreased $16 million. The strengthening of foreign currencies in areas where we operate relative to the U.S. dollar unfavorably impacted SG&A by $6 million.
Operating Income (Loss). Operating income was $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to operating loss of $260 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $267 million.
U.S. Segment-Our U.S. segment had an operating loss of $3 million for 2021 as compared to an operating loss of $207 million for 2020. The $204 million operating loss decrease was due to 2020 charges of $202 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairments, $28 million of inventory-related charges, $8 million of severance costs, and $3 million of costs associated with facility closures. Excluding these charges, operating income decreased $37 million from 2020, which is primarily due to the charges associated with LIFO.
Canadian Segment-Our Canadian segment had an operating loss of $0 million for 2021 as compared to an operating loss of $6 million for 2020. The $6 million improvement in operating loss was primarily a result of $2 million of inventory-related charges, $1 million of severance costs, and $1 million of costs associated with facility closures in 2020.
International Segment-Our International segment had operating income of $10 million for 2021 as compared to operating loss of $47 million in 2020. The $57 million improvement in operating income was primarily attributable to certain unusual charges in 2020. These included $40 million of goodwill impairment charges, $16 million of inventory-related charges, $5 million of severance and $10 million of cost associated with facility closures. Excluding these charges, operating income decreased $14 million from 2020, which is primarily due to the reduced levels of sales activity.
Interest Expense. Our interest expense was $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $28 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in interest expense was attributable to lower average debt levels in 2021 as compared to 2020.
Other, net. Our other income was $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to income of $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Other income for 2020 included a $5 million gain from a sale leaseback transaction.
Income Tax (Benefit) Expense. Our income tax benefit was $0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to a benefit of $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our effective tax rates were 0% and 3% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our rates generally differ from the U.S. federal statutory rates of 21% as a result of state income taxes and differing foreign income tax rates. The lower effective tax rate for 2021 was lower primarily due to tax expense in a foreign jurisdication related to a provision for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets.
Net (Loss) Income. Our net loss was $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to net loss of $274 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $260 million due to the goodwill and intangible asset impairments and inventory-related charges described above.
Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $97 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our Adjusted EBITDA increased $49 million over that period primarily due to the increase in sales and effective cost management.
We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangibles and certain other expenses, including non-cash expenses such as equity-based compensation, severance and restructuring, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments, long-lived asset impairments (including goodwill and intangible assets), inventory-related charges incremental to normal operations and plus or minus the impact of our LIFO inventory costing methodology.
We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors a helpful measure for comparing our operating performance with the performance of other companies that may have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. We believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance without regard to items, such as amortization of intangibles, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon the nature and extent of acquisitions. Similarly, the impact of the LIFO inventory costing method can cause results to vary substantially from company to company depending upon whether they elect to utilize LIFO and depending upon which method they may elect. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance indicator in managing our business. We believe that net income is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA.
The following table reconciles net income, as derived from our consolidated financial statements, with Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure (in millions):
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
For discussion and analysis of fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, please refer to Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 12, 2021 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Financial Condition and Cash Flows
Cash Flows
The following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated below (in millions):
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $56 million in 2021 compared to $261 million provided by operating activities in 2020. The change in operating cash flows was primarily the result of an increase in working capital as a result of inventory purchases and other expenses to support growing market activity, as compared to a reduction in working capital in 2020 as a result of reduced market activity.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $7 million in 2021 compared to $19 million provided in 2020. In 2020, we completed sale leaseback transactions involving four of our locations which generated net proceeds of $29 million. Purchases of property, plant and equipment utilized cash of $10 million and $11 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $118 million in 2021, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $195 million in 2020. In 2021, we made a payment of $86 million on our Term Loan as a result of excess cash flow generation in 2020 as well as $1 million mandatory principal payment. Net payments on our Global ABL Facility totaled $0 million in 2021 compared to $161 million in 2020. We used $24 million to fund dividends on our preferred stock in each of 2021 and 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary credit facilities consist of a Term Loan maturing in September 2024 with an original principal amount of $400 million and a $750 million Global ABL Facility. As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding balance on our Term Loan, net of original issue discount and issuance costs, was $297 million. On an annual basis, we are required to repay an amount equal to 50% of excess cash flow, as defined in the Term Loan agreement, reducing to 25% if the Company’s senior secured leverage ratio is no more than 2.75 to 1.00. No payment of excess cash flow is required if the Company’s senior secured leverage ratio is less than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00. Under the terms of the Term Loan, the amount of cash used in the determination of the senior secured leverage ratio is limited to $75 million. Under this provision of the Term Loan, in April 2021 we made a payment of $86 million as a result of excess cash flow generation in 2020. Based on our senior secured leverage ratio at the end of 2021, we will not be required to make an excess cash flow payment for 2021 in 2022.
In September 2021, we amended and renewed our Global ABL Facility. The Global ABL Facility now matures in September 2026 and provides $705 million in revolver commitments in the United States (with a $30 million sublimit in Canada), $12 million in Norway, $10 million in Australia, $10.5 million in the Netherlands, $7.5 million in the United Kingdom and $5 million in Belgium. The Global ABL Facility contains an accordion feature that allows us to increase the principal amount of the facility by up to $250 million, subject to securing additional lender commitments. U.S. borrowings under the facility bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin varying between 1.25% and 1.75% based on our fixed charge coverage ratio. Canadian borrowings under the facility bear interest at the Canadian Dollar Bankers' Acceptances Rate ("BA Rate") plus a margin varying between 1.25% and 1.75% based on our fixed charge coverage ratio. Borrowings under our foreign borrower subsidiaries bear interest at a benchmark rate, which varies based on the currency in which such borrowings are made, plus a margin varying between 1.25% and 1.75% based on our fixed charge coverage ratio. Availability is dependent on a borrowing base comprised of a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory which is subject to redetermination from time to time. As of December 31, 2021, we had no borrowings outstanding and $484 million of Excess Availability, as defined under our Global ABL Facility.
Our primary sources of liquidity consist of cash generated from our operating activities, existing cash balances and borrowings under our existing Global ABL Facility. At December 31, 2021, our total liquidity, consisting of cash on hand and amounts available under our Global ABL Facility, was $532 million. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from our operating activities is primarily dependent on our sales of products to our customers at profits sufficient to cover our fixed and variable expenses. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $48 million and $119 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, $38 million and $57 million of our cash and cash equivalents were maintained in the accounts of our various foreign subsidiaries and, if those amounts were transferred among countries or repatriated to the U.S., those amounts may be subject to additional tax liabilities, which would be recognized in our financial statements in the period during which the transfer decision was made. During 2021, we repatriated $7 million of cash from our Canadian subsidiaries.
Our credit ratings are below “investment grade” and, as such, could impact both our ability to raise new funds as well as the interest rates on our future borrowings. In the first quarter of 2021, Moody's Investor Services changed our ratings outlook from negative to stable and, in the second quarter of 2021, Standard & Poor's Global Ratings revised the Company's outlook to stable. Our existing obligations restrict our ability to incur additional debt. We were in compliance with the covenants contained in our various credit facilities as of and during the year ended December 31, 2021 and, based on our current forecasts, we expect to remain in compliance. Our credit facilities contain provisions that address the potential need to transition away from LIBOR when LIBOR is discontinued or replaced.
We believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy the anticipated cash requirements associated with our existing operations for the foreseeable future. However, our future cash requirements could be higher than we currently expect as a result of various factors. Additionally, our ability to generate sufficient cash from our operating activities depends on our future performance, which is subject to general economic, political, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. We may, from time to time, seek to raise additional debt or equity financing or re-price or refinance existing debt in the public or private markets, based on market conditions. Any such capital markets activities would be subject to market conditions, reaching final agreement with lenders or investors, and other factors, and there can be no assurance that we would successfully consummate any such transactions.
Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies
Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes our minimum payment obligations as of December 31, 2021 relating to long-term debt, interest payments, capital leases, operating leases, purchase obligations and other long-term liabilities for the periods indicated (in millions):
(1)
Long-term debt is based on debt outstanding at December 31, 2021.
(2)
Interest payments are based on interest rates in effect at December 31, 2021 and assume contractual amortization payments.
(3)
Purchase obligations reflect our commitments to purchase PVF products in the ordinary course of business. While our vendors often allow us to cancel these purchase orders without penalty, in certain cases cancellations may subject us to cancellation fees or penalties, depending on the terms of the contract.
We historically have been an acquisitive company. We expect to fund future acquisitions primarily from (i) borrowings, either the unused portion of our facilities or new debt issuances, (ii) cash provided by operations or (iii) the issuance of additional equity in connection with the acquisitions.
Other Commitments
In the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we are contingently liable for performance under standby letters of credit and bid, performance and surety bonds. We were contingently liable for approximately $19 million of standby letters of credit, trade guarantees that banks issue and bid, and performance and surety bonds at December 31, 2021. Management does not expect any material amounts to be drawn on these instruments.
Legal Proceedings
Asbestos Claims. We are one of many defendants in lawsuits that plaintiffs have brought seeking damages for personal injuries that exposure to asbestos allegedly caused. Plaintiffs and their family members have brought these lawsuits against a large volume of defendant entities as a result of the various defendants’ manufacture, distribution, supply or other involvement with asbestos, asbestos-containing products or equipment or activities that allegedly caused plaintiffs to be exposed to asbestos. These plaintiffs typically assert exposure to asbestos as a consequence of third-party manufactured products that the Company’s subsidiary, MRC Global (US) Inc., purportedly distributed. As of December 31, 2021, we are a named defendant in approximately 596 lawsuits involving approximately 1,161 claims. No asbestos lawsuit has resulted in a judgment against us to date, with the majority being settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved. Applicable third-party insurance has substantially covered these claims, and insurance should continue to cover a substantial majority of existing and anticipated future claims. Accordingly, we have recorded a liability for our estimate of the most likely settlement of asserted claims and a related receivable from insurers for our estimated recovery, to the extent we believe that the amounts of recovery are probable.
We annually conduct analyses of our asbestos-related litigation to estimate the adequacy of the reserve for pending and probable asbestos-related claims. Given these estimated reserves and existing insurance coverage that has been available to cover substantial portions of these claims, we believe that our current accruals and associated estimates relating to pending and probable asbestos-related litigation likely to be asserted over the next 15 years are currently adequate. This belief, however, relies on a number of assumptions, including:
●
That our future settlement payments, disease mix and dismissal rates will be materially consistent with historic experience;
●
That future incidences of asbestos-related diseases in the U.S. will be materially consistent with current public health estimates;
●
That the rates at which future asbestos-related mesothelioma incidences result in compensable claims filings against us will be materially consistent with its historic experience;
●
That insurance recoveries for settlement payments and defense costs will be materially consistent with historic experience;
●
That legal standards (and the interpretation of these standards) applicable to asbestos litigation will not change in material respects;
●
That there are no materially negative developments in the claims pending against us; and
●
That key co-defendants in current and future claims remain solvent.
If any of these assumptions prove to be materially different in light of future developments, liabilities related to asbestos-related litigation may be materially different than amounts accrued or estimated. Further, while we anticipate that additional claims will be filed in the future, we are unable to predict with any certainty the number, timing and magnitude of such future claims. In addition, applicable insurance policies are subject to overall caps on limits, which coverage may exhaust the amount available from insurers under those limits. In those cases, the Company is seeking indemnity payments from responsive excess insurance policies, but other insurers may not be solvent or may not make payments under the policies without contesting their liability. In our opinion, there are no pending legal proceedings that are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Other Legal Claims and Proceedings. From time to time, we have been subject to various claims and involved in legal proceedings incidental to the nature of our businesses. We maintain insurance coverage to reduce financial risk associated with certain of these claims and proceedings. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these claims and proceedings. However, in our opinion, there are no pending legal proceedings that are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. See also “Note 17-Commitments and Contingencies” to the audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any material “off-balance sheet arrangements” as SEC rules and regulations define that term.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. To apply these principles, management must make judgments and assumptions and develop estimates based on the best available information at the time. Actual results may differ based on the accuracy of the information utilized and subsequent events. The notes to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this report describe our accounting policies. These critical accounting policies could materially affect the amounts recorded in our financial statements. We believe the following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
Inventories: Our U.S. inventories are valued at the lower of cost (principally using the LIFO method) or market. We record an estimate each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation (using period to date inflation rates) and estimated year-end inventory balances. These estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Our inventories that are held outside of the U.S., totaling $118 million and $145 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were valued at the lower of weighted-average cost or estimated net realizable value.
Under the LIFO inventory valuation method, changes in the cost of inventory are recognized in cost of sales in the current period even though these costs may have been incurred at significantly different values. Since the Company values most of its inventory using the LIFO inventory costing methodology, a rise in inventory costs has a negative effect on operating results, while, conversely, a fall in inventory costs results in a benefit to operating results.
We determine reserves for inventory based on historical usage of inventory on-hand, assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Customers rely on the company to stock specialized items for certain projects and other needs. Therefore, the estimated carrying value of inventory depends upon demand driven by oil and gas spending activity, which in turn depends on oil and gas prices, the general outlook for economic growth worldwide, political stability in major oil and gas producing areas, and the potential obsolescence of various inventory items we sell.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets: We record goodwill and intangible assets in conjunction with acquisitions that we make. These assets comprise 28% of our total assets as of December 31, 2021. We record goodwill as the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets that we acquire. We record intangible assets at fair value at the date of acquisition and amortize the value of intangible assets over the assets’ estimated useful lives unless we determine that an asset has an indefinite life. We make significant judgments and estimates in both calculating the fair value of these assets and determining their estimated useful lives. The carrying values of our goodwill and intangible assets, by reporting unit, were as follows as of December 31, 2021 (in millions):
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:
Our long-lived assets consist primarily of:
●
customer base intangibles; and
●
property, plant and equipment.
The carrying value of these assets is subject to an impairment test when circumstances indicate a possible impairment. These circumstances would include significant decreases in our operating results and significant changes in market demand for our products and services. When events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment, we assess recoverability from future operations using an undiscounted cash flow analysis, derived from the lowest appropriate asset group. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, we would recognize an impairment charge to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
We group customer base intangible assets on a basis consistent with our reporting units. We determine the fair value of customer base intangibles using a discounted cash flow analysis. The most significant factor in the determination of the fair value of our customer base intangibles is forecasted sales to our customers including, in particular, our largest customers. Possible indicators of impairment could include the following:
●
prolonged decline in commodity oil and natural gas prices;
●
the resulting decline in activity levels of many of our major customers;
●
significant reductions in capital spending budgets of our customers; and
●
a pessimistic outlook for the price of oil and natural gas.
Although we determined there were no impairments of long-lived assets in 2021 and 2020, significant decreases in our forecasted sales, particularly with our largest customers, could result in future impairments of our customer base intangible assets.
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment as of December 31, 2021 was $91 million, or 5% of total assets. This amount was comprised of $81 million, $1 million and $9 million in our U.S., Canada and International segments, respectively. We group property, plant and equipment and evaluate it for recoverability at a country or regional level. We determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment based on appraisal procedures which involve both market and cost techniques depending on the nature of the specific assets and the availability of market information. In 2021, no indicators of property, plant and equipment impairment were present. Based on the nature of our property, plant and equipment and the reduction in carrying value each year through depreciation, we believe future impairments are not likely.
When testing for the impairment of the value of long-lived assets, we make forecasts of:
●
our future operating results;
●
the extent and timing of future cash flows;
●
working capital;
●
profitability; and
●
sales growth trends.
We make these forecasts using the best available information at the time, including information regarding current market conditions and customer spending forecasts. While we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable, because of the volatile nature of the energy industry, actual results may differ materially from the projected results which could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges. Factors that could lead to actual results differing materially from projected results include, among other things, further reductions of oil and natural gas prices and changes in projected sales growth rates.
Impairment of Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets: We assess goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually, as of October 1st each year, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. Within each reporting unit, we have elected to aggregate the component countries and regions into a single reporting unit based on their similar economic characteristics, products, customers, suppliers, methods of distribution and the manner in which we operate each segment.
In the first half of 2020, demand for oil and natural gas declined sharply as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This disruption in demand and the resulting decline in the price of oil had a dramatic negative impact on our business. We experienced a significant reduction in sales beginning in April 2020 which continued throughout the second quarter. At that time, there remained ongoing uncertainty around the timing and extent of any recovery. We took a more pessimistic long-term outlook due to the significant reduction in the demand for oil, the implications of that demand destruction on the price of oil for an extended period of time and actions our customers had taken to curtail costs and reduce spending. As a result of those developments, we concluded that it was more likely than not the fair values of our U.S. and International reporting units and our U.S. indefinite-lived tradename were lower than their carrying values. Accordingly, we completed an interim impairment test as of April 30, 2020 and recognized impairment charges of $217 million for goodwill, comprised of $177 million in our U.S. reporting unit and $40 million in our International reporting unit, and $25 million for our indefinite-lived intangible asset. Subsequent to these impairments, we only have goodwill recorded in our U.S. reporting unit and U.S. tradename is our only indefinite-lived intangible asset.
In connection with our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived tradename impairment tests as of October 1, 2021, and 2020, we performed a qualitative assessment of the carrying value of the goodwill for our U.S. reporting unit and U.S. indefinite-lived tradename asset. This assessment took into consideration changes in the broader economy, our industry and our business since the interim quantitative impairment tests completed as of April 30, 2020. Based on our assessment, we concluded there was no additional impairment of our goodwill or U.S. tradename.
When we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the carrying value of the reporting unit that has the goodwill with the estimated fair value of that reporting unit. To the extent the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than its estimated fair value, a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the difference, up to the carrying value of goodwill. Our impairment methodology uses discounted cash flow and multiples of cash earnings valuation techniques, acquisition control premium and valuation comparisons to similar businesses to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. Each of these methods involves Level 3 unobservable market inputs and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding:
●
future operating results,
●
the extent and timing of future cash flows,
●
working capital,
●
sales prices,
●
profitability,
●
discount rates; and
●
sales growth trends.
We make these forecasts using the best available information at the time including information regarding current market conditions and customer spending forecasts. While we believe that these assumptions and estimates are reasonable, because of the volatile nature of the energy industry, actual results may differ materially from the projected results which could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges. Factors that could lead to actual results differing materially from projected results include, among other things:
●
reduction of oil and natural gas prices,
●
changes in projected sales growth rate; and
●
changes in factors affecting our discount rate including risk premiums, risk free interest rates and costs of capital.
When we perform a quantitative impairment test for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, we compare the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets with their estimated fair value. If the carrying value is more than the estimated fair value, we recognize impairment losses in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value. Our impairment methodology uses discounted cash flow and estimated royalty rate valuation techniques. Utilizing these valuation methods, we make certain assumptions and estimates regarding:
●
future operating results,
●
sales prices,
●
discount rates; and
●
sales growth trends.
As with the goodwill impairment test described above, while we believe that our assumptions and estimates are reasonable, because of the volatile nature of the energy industry, actual results may differ materially from the projected results which could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges.
Income Taxes: We use the liability method for determining our income taxes, under which current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the tax rate expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refunds received. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
In determining the need for valuation allowances and our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider and make judgments regarding all the available positive and negative evidence, including the timing of the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, estimated future taxable income, ongoing, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and recent financial results of operations. The amount of valuation allowances, however, could be adjusted in the future if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present in certain jurisdictions and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.
Our tax provision is based upon our expected taxable income and statutory rates in effect in each country in which we operate. We are subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and foreign tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes we provide during any given year.
A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits. We adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which the new information is available.
