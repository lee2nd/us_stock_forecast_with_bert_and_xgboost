The financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are presented on a consolidated basis and include the accounts of the Company and our subsidiaries. See, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for further information regarding consolidation. References to “GlassBridge,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” are to GlassBridge Enterprises Inc., and its subsidiaries and consolidated entities unless the context indicates otherwise. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).
Introduction
GlassBridge has, during recent periods, undergone significant changes. Until 2015, we primarily provided data storage and security solutions through our two legacy business segments. On August 16, 2018, the Company sold its Nexsan business. During 2019, the Company sold its international subsidiaries and acquired a controlling interest in SportBLX. On December 30, 2021, the Company sold its interest in SportBLX.
As a result of these transactions, the Company now operates a single segment, an asset management business.
In January 2021, Adara received notice from ESW that Adara had defaulted on its obligation to pay at maturity, i.e., on January 20, 2021, $11,000,000 in principal and all other amounts due to ESW under the ESW Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the ESW Loan Agreement, AEC gave to ESW a security interest in all of AEC’s assets, and GlassBridge pledged to ESW all of GlassBridge’s AEC stock and 30% of GlassBridge’s SportBLX stock. The Loan Agreement provided that, upon AEC’s default, AEC may elect to cooperate with ESW to effect a prearranged reorganization of AEC in bankruptcy, pursuant to which ESW acquires from GlassBridge all equity in AEC and certain of its assets, most notably property and equipment consisting of quantitative trading software, as well as deferred tax assets resulting from net operating losses, for consideration of $8,500,000, which amount would be used to satisfy the claims of all valid creditors and certain administrative expenses associated with the bankruptcy case, with all residual funds to be paid to GlassBridge. On April 22, 2021, AEC filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. AEC’s prepackaged chapter 11 plan of reorganization was confirmed at a hearing on June 9, 2021 and became effective on June 15, 2021. On the effective date, ESW paid $8.5 million, less $325,000 that ESW had previously funded in the form of a postpetition debtor-in-possession loan to fund the costs of administration associated with AEC’s bankruptcy case. Also on the effective date, all shares in reorganized AEC were issued to ESW and an affiliate. In addition, GlassBridge received a release of its guaranty obligations to ESW.
The Company received a distribution from the bankruptcy estate of $2,017,238, in September 2021, and final, additional distributions totaling $4,577,465 in December 2021. The total amount distributed to the Company from the bankruptcy estate was $6,594,703. As of December 31, 2021, there are no funds remaining in the bankruptcy estate.
Adara has historically been one of the subsidiaries through which the company has operated its asset management business. The Company, however, remains committed to its asset management business and holds various investments and assets, including Arrive LLC (“Arrive”), in other subsidiaries

Results of Operations
Net Revenue
“NM” - Indicates the Percent Change is not meaningful
Net revenue was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $0.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A)
SG&A expense decreased in 2021 compared with 2020 by $0.7 million (or 10.4%) due to an effort to reduce overhead.
Restructuring
Total restructuring expense was $0.3 million and $0.0 million, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Restructuring expense of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 was attributable to post petition fees in connection with the bankruptcy.
Operating Loss From Continuing Operations
Operating loss from continuing operations of $6.2 million decreased in 2021 by $0.5 million, compared with an operating loss of $6.7 million in 2020.
Other Income and (Expense)
NM - Not meaningful
Total other income was $19.2 million in 2021, compared to other expense of $12.9 million in 2020. Other income in 2021 primarily related to the gain on Chapter 11 reorganization of Adara and forgiveness a note payable issued under the Paycheck Protection Program (the “Bank Loan”). Other expense in 2020 primarily related to the settlement of the Company’s pension liability.
Income Tax Benefit (Provision)
NM - Not meaningful
The income tax provision was $0.0 million in 2021 and 2020. Because we maintain a valuation allowance related to our U.S. deferred tax assets, the tax provision generally represents discrete tax events that may occur from time to time.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had valuation allowances of $157.2 million and $232.0 million, respectively, to account for deferred tax assets we have concluded are not considered to be more-likely-than-not to be realized in the future due to our cumulative losses in recent years. The deferred tax assets subject to valuation allowance include certain operating loss carryforwards, deferred tax deductions, capital loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards.
Income (loss) from discontinued operations
Discontinued operations represent the results of operations from our Sports Technology Platform.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, loss from discontinued operations primarily relates to a goodwill impairment. During the fourth quarter of 2020, management engaged in a strategic and financial assessment of the Sports Technology Business. In assessing recoverability of the goodwill recorded as part of the purchase price allocation from the SportBLX acquisition, we compared the carrying amount of the goodwill with its implied fair value. To determine the estimated fair value, we used the cost approach, a valuation technique that involves determining the total asset value of a business and reducing that value by the amount of its outstanding liabilities. As a result of this assessment, we determined the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded its fair value. Consequently, we recorded an impairment charge of $42.3 million in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. The impairment of goodwill was driven by a number of factors affecting our Sports Technology Business in 2020 including, but not limited to, the outbreak of COVID-19 and its impact on sports globally, the performance of the business and its capital position.
Restructuring and other includes the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $1.3 million or the year ended December 31, 2020. These amounts were reclassified to discontinued operations due to the sale of the Sports Technology Platform in the period ending December 31, 2021.
On December 30, 2021, in a series of transactions, the Company completed the disposition of its entire interest in SportBLX. As a result of these transactions, the Company recorded a net gain on the sale and deconsolidation of SportBLX of $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
Segment Results
With the sale of the Sport Technology Platform business on December 30, 2021, the asset management business is our only reportable segment as of December 31, 2021. Results from the Sports Technology Platform were reported within discontinued operations.
We evaluate segment performance based on revenue and operating loss. The operating loss reported in our segments excludes corporate and other unallocated amounts. Although such amounts are excluded from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated results. Corporate and unallocated amounts include costs which are not allocated to the business segments in management’s evaluation of segment performance such as litigation settlement expense, corporate expense and other expenses.
Information related to our segments is as follows:
Asset Management Business
NM - Not meaningful
Revenue from our asset management business primarily consists of management and performance fees paid by the funds under our management.
Corporate and Unallocated
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the corporate and unallocated operating loss increased by $2.7 million compared to 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the $0.3 million of restructuring expense presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations was allocated to the Asset Management Business.
Financial Position
Our cash and cash equivalents balance, as of December 31, 2021, was $4.1 million, compared to cash of $1.3 million, as of December 31, 2020. See the Analysis of Cash Flows section below for more information.
Our accounts payable balance, as of December 31, 2021, was $1.1 million, a decrease of $0.1 million from $1.2 million, as of December 31, 2020.
Our other current liabilities balance, as of December 31, 2021, was $0.4 million, a decrease of $0.9 million from $1.3 million, as of December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary sources of liquidity include our cash and cash equivalents. Our primary operating liquidity needs relate to our working capital and funding our operations.
We had $4.1 million cash on hand as of December 31, 2021.
Our liquidity needs for the next 12 months include the following: corporate expenses of approximately $2.4 million and any cash shortfall associated with our businesses.
We expect that our cash, in addition to asset monetization, will provide liquidity sufficient to meet our needs for our operations and our obligations. We also plan to raise additional capital if necessary, although no assurance can be made that we will be able to secure such financing, if needed, on favorable terms or at all.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less. Restricted cash is related to contractual obligations or restricted by management and is included in other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets depending on the timing of the restrictions. The restricted cash balance in other current assets as of December 31, 2021 was $0.0 million and as of December 31, 2020 was $0.5 million.
Analysis of Cash Flows
Cash Flows Used in Operating Activities:

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates to ensure they are consistent with historical experience and the various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could materially impact our results of operations.
We believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:
Uncertain Tax Positions. Our income tax returns are subject to review by various taxing authorities. As such, we record accruals for items that we believe may be challenged by these taxing authorities. The threshold for recognizing the benefit of a tax return position in the financial statements is that the position must more-likely-than-not be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position. If the recognition threshold is met, the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. At December 31, 2020 and 2021, our accrual related to uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits was $0.0 million.
Our U.S. federal income tax returns for 2018 through 2021 are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to examination by foreign tax jurisdictions or state and local tax jurisdictions for years before 2015.
The ultimate outcome of tax matters may differ from our estimates and assumptions. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue may require the use of cash and could result in increased income tax expense. Favorable resolution could result in reduced income tax expense. It is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits could increase or decrease significantly during the next twelve months due to the resolution of certain U.S. and international tax uncertainties; however, it is not possible to estimate the potential change at this time.
Intangibles. We record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase transactions, including intangibles, at estimated fair value. Intangible assets with a definite life are amortized based on a pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are consumed, typically with useful lives ranging from one to 30 years. The initial recognition of intangible assets, the determination of useful lives and, if necessary, subsequent impairment analysis require management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets will perform in the future using certain valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis. We evaluate assets on our balance sheet, including such intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors such as unfavorable variances from forecasted cash flows, established business plans or volatility inherent to external markets and industries may indicate a possible impairment that would require an impairment test. The test for impairment requires a comparison of the carrying value of the asset or asset group with their estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying value of the asset or asset group is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value.
Goodwill. We record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill, at fair value. The initial recognition of goodwill and subsequent impairment analysis require management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets will perform in the future using valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis. Goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized. We test the carrying amount of a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each year or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would warrant impairment testing during an interim period.
Goodwill is considered impaired when its carrying amount exceeds its implied fair value. The Company may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If we determine in this assessment that the fair value of the reporting unit is more than its carrying amount, we may conclude that there is no need to perform Step 1 of the impairment test. We have an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test.
Step 1 of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill was assigned to its carrying amount. If fair value is deemed to be less than carrying value, Step 2 of the impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill, an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess. This involves measuring the fair value of the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities (both recognized and unrecognized) at the time of the impairment test. The difference between the reporting unit’s fair value and the fair values assigned to the reporting unit’s individual assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill.
Claims and Litigation. We record a liability when a loss from a pending or threatened claim or litigation is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
