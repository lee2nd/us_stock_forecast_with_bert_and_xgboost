Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this report. This discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report. We disclaim any obligation to update information contained in any forward-looking statement.
General
We presently sell our ancillary gaming products in the United States but contemplate selling and leasing our products worldwide, in the future. Although the Company has obtained the license for the manufacturing, sale, marketing and licensing of the four roulette patents, the Company has not developed or manufactured any products for license, lease or sale to casinos yet. Although the Company is licensed to manufacturer patented roulette wheels and tables, it has no intention of doing so now or in the foreseeable future. The licensed games will not be available for sale on our website until approved by the applicable Gaming Control Board.
The Company has not, as of yet, arranged for any lines of credit, and we have no commitments, written or oral, from officers, directors or shareholders to provide the Company with advances, loans or other funding for our operations.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America required management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, based on historical experience, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
From time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies that may have an impact on the Company’s accounting and reporting. The Company believes that such recently issued accounting pronouncements and other authoritative guidance for which the effective date is in the future will not have an impact on its accounting or reporting or that such impact will not be material to its financial position, results of operations and cash flows when implemented.
Results of Operations
Year ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the year ended December 31, 2020
Revenues
The Company generated revenues of $32 and $0 for the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
General and Administrative Expenses
During the year ended December 31, 2021, general and administrative expenses were $38,265, consisting primarily of professional fees and stock compensation expense, as compared to $70,208 for year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease of $31,943 was primarily due to a decrease in professional fees and stock compensation expense.
Interest Expense
During the year ended December 31, 2021, interest expense was $126,199 as compared to $19,088 for year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $107,111 was primarily due to an increase in accrued interest due to additional proceeds from third parties and amortization of debt discount.
Net Loss
Our net loss was $164,432 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to a loss of $81,174 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to the reasons referred to above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had a stockholders’ deficit of $274,689 and negative working capital of $299,648 compared to stockholders’ deficit of $144,757 and negative working capital of $144,757 at December 31, 2020. Cash was $1,207 as of December 31, 2021, as compared to $65,176 at December 31, 2020. This decrease in our working capital was primarily attributable to the decrease of cash of $63,969, the increase in accrued interest due of $15,257, the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $3,736, and an increase in convertible notes of $72,705. The net loss for the year ended 2021 was primarily due to amortization of debt discount of $99,205.
Net cash used in operations during 2021 was $41,969 compared with $23,937 used in operations during 2020. Cash used in operations during 2021 was primarily due to the net loss in the period, amortization of debt discount and changes in accrued interest.
Net cash provided by investing activities was $30,000 in 2021 and $0 in 2020, which was due to payments towards intellectual property.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $8,000 in 2021 and $86,000 in 2020, which was the result of proceeds from convertible notes payable and notes payable.
Going Concern
The Company generated minimal revenues, has experienced recurring net operating losses since inception and had negative working capital of $299,648 and stockholders’ deficit of $274,689 at December 31, 2021. Because of these factors, among others, it raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty. We will need to raise funds or implement our business plan to continue operations.
The Company’s present plans, the realization of which cannot be assured, to overcome these difficulties include, but are not limited to, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. Through capital influx from third party investors, the Company plans to spend on marketing for all current products to generate revenues, enter into license and royalty agreements with its patented products, as well as seek acquisitions that generate cash flows. However management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.
