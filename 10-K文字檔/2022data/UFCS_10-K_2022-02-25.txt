ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Amounts (except per share amounts) are presented in thousands, unless otherwise noted.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
It is important to note that our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please refer to "Forward-Looking Information" and Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of this report for information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
Originally founded in 1946 as United Fire & Casualty Company, United Fire Group, Inc. and its consolidated insurance company subsidiaries provide insurance protection for individuals and businesses through several regional companies. Our property and casualty insurance company subsidiaries are licensed in 50 states plus the District of Columbia and are represented by approximately 1,000 independent agencies.
Reportable Segments
Our property and casualty insurance business operates and reports as one business segment. For more information, refer to Part I, Item 1 "Business" under "General Description."
Pooling Arrangement
All of our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are members of an intercompany reinsurance pooling arrangement. The Company's pooling arrangement permits the participating companies to rely on the capacity of the entire pool's capital and surplus, rather than being limited to policy exposures of a size commensurate with each participant’s own surplus level.
Geographic Concentration
Property and Casualty Insurance Business
For 2021, approximately 50.0 percent of our property and casualty premiums were written in Texas, California, Iowa, Missouri and New Jersey.
In 2021, 2020 and 2019 the direct statutory premiums written by our property and casualty insurance operations were distributed as follows:
Sources of Revenue and Expense
We evaluate profit or loss based upon operating and investment results. Profit or loss described in the following sections of this Management's Discussion and Analysis is reported on a pre-tax basis. Our primary sources of revenue are premiums and investment income. Major categories of expenses include losses and loss settlement expenses, underwriting and other operating expenses.
Profit Factors
Our profitability is influenced by many factors, including price, competition, economic conditions, investment returns, interest rates, catastrophic events and other natural disasters, man-made disasters, state regulations, court decisions, and changes in the law. To manage these risks and uncertainties, we seek to achieve consistent profitability through strong agency relationships, exceptional customer service, fair and prompt claims handling, disciplined underwriting, superior loss control services, prudent management of our investments, appropriate matching of assets and liabilities, effective use of ceded reinsurance and effective and efficient use of technology.
COVID-19
The spread of the COVID-19 virus, beginning in mid-March 2020, caused significant financial market volatility, economic uncertainty and interruptions to normal business activities. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on day-to-day life, financial markets and the economy in the United States. The Company, in response to the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, activated its pre-existing business continuity plans to respond to a pandemic in mid-March 2020. With the exception of our essential services employees, UFG dispatched its staff to work remotely for the safety, health and well-being of our employees. We have been and continue to be fully operational during the pandemic. In the second half of 2021, we gave employees the option to work fully remote, a hybrid schedule or return to the workplace 100 percent of the time depending on the position and with manager approval. Our employees who are working in the office are following recommended health and safety policies. We continue to evaluate our plan and will make any necessary adjustments in light of the emergence of variant strains and current case counts where our offices are located. We have implemented and will continue to implement any safety measures necessary for the safety and health of our employees.
The implementation of our business continuity plans did not have a material effect on our internal control environment. We believe our operational processes, internal controls over financial reporting and disclosures, and financial reporting systems are operating effectively in the present environment.
Nearly all of the policies we have issued contain contract language that specifically excludes business interruption coverage for losses due to viruses such as the COVID-19 pandemic, but we continue to carefully scrutinize each claim and intend to afford coverage when appropriate. At this time, we expect the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on claims currently under our coverages to be manageable, based on the information presently available. However, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence of variant strains, continue to evolve and we cannot predict the extent to which our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity will ultimately be impacted. Additionally, if established written contract policy exclusions of business interruption coverage for losses attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic are voided or changed through legislation, regulations or interpretations by the courts, such changes have the potential to materially increase claims, losses and legal expenses which could impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
We believe our current liquidity position is sufficient to maintain our current operations and we have the ability to draw on our credit facility if needed. See Part II, Item 8, Note 13 "Debt" for more information. Our share repurchase program was suspended in mid-March 2020 and restarted in the first quarter of 2021. Also, the Company maintained the payment of quarterly cash dividends during 2020 and 2021, with the dividends paid in December 2021 marking the 215th consecutive quarter of paying dividends since March 1968.
Stockholders' equity increased to $879.1 million at December 31, 2021, from $825.1 million at December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily attributed to a net income of $80.6 million and change in liability for employee benefit plans of $20.7 million, partially offset by shareholder dividends of $15.1 million and a decrease in net unrealized investment gains on fixed maturity securities of $33.3 million, net of tax.
We evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets may exceed their implied fair value. Goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level, for which we have one reporting unit level. Any impairment is charged to operations in the period that the impairment is identified. During the third quarter of 2020, we completed our annual quantitative analysis of goodwill. As a result of the quantitative analysis, we impaired the remaining balance of our goodwill of $15.1 million as of September 30, 2020 based on the following factors: (i) disruptions in the equity markets, specifically for property and casualty insurance companies, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and due to recent weather related catastrophes; (ii) recent elevated commercial auto loss ratios; and (iii) the fair value of our stock trading significantly below book value. The Company used a weighting of the income and market approaches to determine the fair value of the reporting unit.
As of December 31, 2021, we intend to keep all assets currently leased and honor the terms of the contracts. Also, we have four lease contracts where we are the lessor which we evaluated for impairment. As of December 31, 2021, all payments on these contracts had been received and we fully expect to receive all future payments on time. In the event that we receive any lease-related relief provided to mitigate the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we elect not to evaluate whether or not the relief represents a lease modification.
The decline in certain sectors of the equity markets in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic did have a material impact on the fair value of our investments in equity securities and limited liability partnerships. The Company's investment philosophy, objectives, approach and program have not changed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. During 2021 we had a recovery in the fair value of equity securities of $47.4 million and an increase in value of our investments in limited liability partnerships of $9.7 million from the values reported at December 31, 2020.
The Company has a highly rated fixed maturity portfolio, with low credit risk. The Company recognized a decrease in unrealized gains of $33.3 million, net of tax, at December 31, 2021 on its available-for-sale fixed maturity portfolio due to a decrease in the size of the fixed maturity portfolio and an increase in interest rates. In addition, we adopted new accounting guidance on January 1, 2020, which changes the measurement of credit losses for our investment in available-for-sale fixed maturities and our mortgage loans and also impacts our reinsurance receivables. The adoption of this new guidance resulted in an immaterial allowance for credit losses to be recorded for each of these assets on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. For more information on credit losses, please
refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 2 "Summary of Investments" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
MEASUREMENT OF RESULTS
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis of GAAP. We also prepare financial statements for each of our insurance company subsidiaries based on statutory accounting principles and file them with insurance regulatory authorities in the states where they do business.
Management evaluates our operations by monitoring key measures of growth and profitability. We believe that disclosure of certain non-GAAP financial measures enhances investor understanding of our financial performance. The following provides further explanation of the key measures management uses to evaluate our results:
Catastrophe losses is a commonly used non-GAAP financial measure which utilizes the designations of the Insurance Services Office ("ISO") and are reported with losses and loss settlement expense amounts net of reinsurance recoverables, unless specified otherwise. According to the ISO, a catastrophe loss is defined as a single unpredictable incident or series of closely related incidents that result in $25.0 million or more in U.S. industry-wide direct insured losses to property and that affect a significant number of insureds and insurers ("ISO catastrophe"). In addition to ISO catastrophes, we also include as catastrophes those events ("non-ISO catastrophes"), which may include U.S. or international losses, that we believe are, or will be, material to our operations, either in amount or in number of claims made. Management, at times, may determine for comparison purposes of our financial results that it is more meaningful to exclude extraordinary catastrophe losses and resulting litigation. The frequency and severity of catastrophic losses we experience in any year affect our results of operations and financial position. In analyzing the underwriting performance of our property and casualty insurance business, we evaluate performance both including and excluding catastrophe losses. Portions of our catastrophe losses may be recoverable under our catastrophe reinsurance agreements. We include a discussion of the impact of catastrophes because we believe it is meaningful for investors to understand the variability in our periodic earnings.
(1) Includes international assumed losses.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021, 2020 AND 2019
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
NM = not meaningful
(1) The net loss ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of losses and loss settlement expenses by net premiums earned. We use the net loss ratio as a measure of the overall underwriting profitability of the insurance business we write and to assess the adequacy of our pricing. Our net loss ratio is meaningful in evaluating our financial results as reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
(2) The expense ratio is calculated by dividing non-deferred underwriting expenses and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs by net premiums earned. The expense ratio measures a company's operational efficiency in producing, underwriting and administering its insurance business.
(3) The combined ratio is a commonly used financial measure of property and casualty underwriting performance. A combined ratio below 100.0 percent generally indicates a profitable book of business. The combined ratio is the sum of the net loss ratio and the underwriting expense ratio.
Net income reported in 2021 as compared to a net loss in 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in losses and loss settlement expenses, a decrease in other underwriting expenses, an increase in investment income and net investment gains from an increase in the fair value of equity securities, as compared to net investment losses for the same period in 2020. These were partially offset by a decrease in net premiums earned.
In 2020, the decrease in net income compared to 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of equity securities, realized losses on sales of equity securities, increases in losses and loss settlement expenses, namely from catastrophe losses and an increase in severity of losses, decrease in net premiums earned, a decrease in net investment income and goodwill impairment.
Premiums
The following table shows our premiums written and earned for 2021, 2020 and 2019:
NM = not meaningful
(1) Net premiums written: Net premiums written is a non-GAAP measure. While not a substitute for any GAAP measure of performance, net premiums written is frequently used by industry analysts and other recognized reporting sources to facilitate comparisons of the performance of insurance companies. Net premiums written are the amount charged for insurance policy contracts issued and recognized on an annualized basis at the effective date of the policy. Management believes net premiums written are a meaningful measure for evaluating insurance company sales performance and geographical expansion efforts. Net premiums written for an insurance company consists of direct premiums written and reinsurance assumed, less reinsurance ceded. Net premiums earned is calculated on a pro rata basis over the terms of the respective policies. Unearned premium reserves are established for the portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired term of insurance policy in force. The difference between net premiums earned and net premiums written is the change in unearned premiums and change in prepaid reinsurance premiums.
Net Premiums Written
Net premiums written comprise direct and assumed premiums written, less ceded premiums written. Direct premiums written are the total policy premiums, net of cancellations, associated with policies issued and underwritten by our property and casualty insurance business. Assumed premiums written are the total premiums associated with the insurance risk transferred to us by other insurance and reinsurance companies pursuant to reinsurance contracts. Ceded premiums written is the portion of direct premiums written that we cede to our reinsurers under our reinsurance contracts. Net premiums earned are recognized ratably over the life of a policy and differ from net premiums written, which are recognized on the effective date of the policy.
Direct Premiums Written
Direct premiums written decreased $153.8 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to our focus on improving profitability through non-renewal of under-performing accounts in our commercial auto line of business and our exit from the personal lines business which began in September 2020. Direct premiums written decreased $78.1 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to our focus on improving profitability through non-renewal of underperforming accounts in our commercial auto line of business, sale of the renewal rights of our personal lines business to Nationwide and, to a lesser extent, a reduction due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Assumed Premiums Written
Assumed premiums written increased $96.0 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 due to growth of our assumed book by the addition of new programs and cedant premium growth.
Assumed premiums written increased $6.5 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to growth of our assumed book by the addition of new programs and cedant premium growth.
Ceded Premiums Written
Direct and assumed premiums written are reduced by the ceded premiums that we pay to reinsurers. For 2021, we ceded 13.8 percent more premiums to reinsurers related to the Fund's at Lloyd's agreement offset by a decrease in written premium for ICAT, decrease in reinstatement premium paid for CAT events, and decreased placement of facultative reinsurance. For 2020, we ceded 18.6 percent more premiums to reinsurers as a result of increased placement of facultative reinsurance, continued growth in managing general agency contracts and ceded reinstatement paid.
Losses and Loss Settlement Expenses
Climate Change and Catastrophe Exposures
Catastrophe losses are inherent risks of the property and casualty insurance business. Catastrophic events include, without limitation, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, hailstorms, wildfires, high winds, winter storms and other natural disasters, along with man-made exposures to losses resulting from, without limitation, acts of war, acts of terrorism and political instability. Such events result in insured losses that can be, and may continue to be, a material factor in our results of operations and financial position, as the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in an area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Because the level of insured losses that may occur in any one year cannot be accurately predicted, these losses contribute to fluctuations in our year-to-year results of operations and financial position. Some types of catastrophes are more likely to occur at certain times within the year than others, which adds an element of seasonality to our property and casualty insurance claims. Our property and casualty insurance business experiences some seasonality with regard to premiums written, which are generally highest in January and July and lowest during the fourth quarter. Losses and loss settlement expenses incurred tend to remain consistent throughout the year, with the exception of catastrophe losses, which generally are highest in the second and third quarters. The frequency and severity of catastrophic events are difficult to accurately predict in any year. However, some geographic locations are more susceptible to these events than others.
We control our direct insurance exposures in regions that are prone to naturally occurring catastrophic events through a combination of geographic diversification, restrictions on the amount and location of new business production in such regions, and reinsurance. We regularly assess our concentration of risk exposures in natural catastrophe exposed areas and consider the impacts of climate change and the unpredictability of future trends in adjusting our geographic concentrations in emerging areas of the United States. We have strategies and underwriting standards to manage these exposures through individual risk selection, subject to regulatory constraints, and through the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance coverage. We use catastrophe modeling and a risk concentration management tool to monitor and control our accumulations of potential losses in natural catastrophe exposed areas of the United States, such as the Gulf and East Coasts, as well as in areas of exposure in other countries where we are exposed to a portion of an insurer's underwriting risk under our assumed reinsurance contracts.
Overall, the models indicate increased risk estimates for our exposure to hurricanes in the U.S., but the impact of the models on our book of business varies significantly among the regions that we model for hurricanes. Based on our analysis, we have implemented more targeted underwriting and rate initiatives in some regions. We intend to continue to take underwriting actions and/or purchase additional reinsurance as necessary to reduce our exposure.
Catastrophe modeling generally relies on multiple inputs based on experience, science, engineering and history, and the selection of those inputs requires a significant amount of judgment. The modeling results may also fail to account for risks that are outside the range of normal probability or are otherwise unforeseen. Because of this, actual results may differ materially from those derived from our modeling assumptions.
Despite our efforts to manage our catastrophe exposure, the occurrence of one or more severe natural catastrophic events in heavily populated areas could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
The process of estimating and establishing reserves for losses incurred from catastrophic events is inherently uncertain and the actual ultimate cost of a claim, net of reinsurance recoveries, may vary materially from the estimated amount reserved. Although we reinsure a portion of our exposure, reinsurance may prove to be inadequate if a major catastrophic event exceeds our reinsurance limits or if we experience a number of small catastrophic events that individually fall below our reinsurance retention level.
Catastrophe Losses
In 2021, our pre-tax catastrophe losses were $98.6 million, a decrease of $43.4 million compared to $142.0 million in 2020 and an increase of $34.2 million as compared to $64.4 million in 2019. In 2021, our catastrophe losses included 58 events. Catastrophe losses in 2021 added 10.2 percentage points to the combined ratio, which is above our historical 10-year average of 7.3 percentage points.
In 2020, our pre-tax catastrophe losses were $142.0 million, an increase of $77.6 million compared to $64.4 million in 2019 and an increase of $95.3 million as compared to $46.7 million in 2018. In 2020, our catastrophe losses included 60 catastrophes with the largest event being the August Midwest derecho. Catastrophe losses in 2020 added 13.5 percentage points to the combined ratio, which is above our historical 10-year average of 7.4 percentage points.
Catastrophe Reinsurance
In 2021, we exceeded our catastrophe reinsurance retention level of $20.0 million with winter storm Uri which caused widespread freezing damages across multiple states in February. Uri was a full retention loss, with losses in excess of our stated reinsurance retention of $20.0 million. Total losses from this storm, including assumed reinsurance, were $28.5 million with $7 million of reinsurance recoveries. In 2021, we also exceeded our catastrophe reinsurance retention level of $20.0 million from further loss development from the April 2020 Midwest hail storm. A majority of the losses occurred in 2020, with the reinsurance retention level reached in 2021.
In 2020, we exceeded our catastrophe reinsurance retention level of $20.0 million with the August Midwest derecho, causing widespread storms and high winds. The August Midwest derecho was a full retention loss, with losses in excess of our stated reinsurance retention of $20.0 million. Total losses from this storm incurred in 2020 were $101.8 million with $81.8 million of reinsurance recoveries. In 2019, we did not exceed our catastrophe reinsurance retention level of $20.0 million per event.
We use many reinsurers, both domestic and foreign, which helps us to avoid concentrations of credit risk associated with our reinsurance. All reinsurers we do business with must meet the following minimum criteria: capital and surplus of at least $300.0 million and an A.M. Best rating or an S&P rating of at least "A-." If a reinsurer is rated by both rating agencies, then both ratings must be at least an "A-."
The following table represents the primary reinsurers we utilize and their financial strength ratings as of December 31, 2021:
(1)Primary reinsurers participating in the property and casualty excess of loss programs.
(2)Primary reinsurers participating in the surety excess of loss program.
Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 4 "Reinsurance" for further discussion of our reinsurance programs.
Terrorism Coverage
The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 ("TRIPRA") is the fourth reauthorization of the law, which was previously reauthorized in 2005, 2007, and 2015. TRIPRA coverage is effective through December 31, 2027 and preserves the current industry loss trigger of $200 million per year, and gradually increased the industry-wide retention to $37.5 billion per year. TRIPRA coverage includes most direct commercial lines of business, including coverage for losses from nuclear, biological and chemical exposures if coverage was afforded by an insurer, with exclusions for commercial automobile insurance, burglary and theft insurance, surety, professional liability insurance and farm owners multiple peril insurance. Under TRIPRA, each insurer has a deductible amount, which is 20.0 percent of the prior year's direct commercial lines earned premiums for the applicable lines of business, and retention of 15.0 percent above the deductible. No insurer that has met its deductible shall be liable for the payment of any portion of that amount that exceeds the annual aggregate loss cap specified in TRIPRA. TRIPRA provides marketplace stability. As a result, coverage for terrorist events in both the insurance and reinsurance markets is often available. The amount of aggregate losses necessary for an act of terrorism to be certified by the U.S. Secretary of Treasury, the Secretary of State and the Attorney General was $200.0 million for 2021 and remains the same for 2022. Our TRIPRA deductible was $139.8 million for 2021 and our TRIPRA deductible is expected to be $132.6 million for 2022. Our catastrophe and non-catastrophe reinsurance programs provide limited coverage for terrorism exposure excluding nuclear, biological and chemical-related claims.
2021 Results
In 2021, our losses and loss settlement expenses were 25.0 percent lower than 2020 and our net loss ratio decreased 14.7 points. The decrease in losses and loss settlement expenses was primarily due to a decrease in frequency and severity of commercial auto liability losses and comparatively lower catastrophe losses. In 2021, catastrophe losses were $98.6 million in both our direct business and assumed reinsurance business as compared to $142.0 million in 2020.
2020 Results
In 2020, our losses and loss settlement expenses were 4.7 percent higher than 2019 and our net loss ratio increased 6.0 points. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in the severity of losses from social inflation, an increase in catastrophe losses and prior accident year reserve strengthening. With the continued escalation of losses from social inflation, especially with commercial auto and auto liability losses industry wide, we focused on
continuing our strategic plan to reduce the size of our commercial auto book in 2021. By reducing commercial auto exposure units in underperforming accounts and growing more profitable lines of business such as excess and surplus, surety and assumed reinsurance, we achieved a better balance in our portfolio. Catastrophe losses increased to $142.0 million in both our direct business and assumed reinsurance business as compared to $64.4 million in 2019.
Reserve Development
For many liability claims, significant periods of time, ranging up to several years, and for certain construction defect claims, more than a decade, may elapse between the occurrence of the loss, the reporting of the loss to us and the settlement or other disposition of the claim. As a result, loss experience in the more recent accident years for the long-tail liability coverages has limited statistical credibility in our reserving process because a relatively small proportion of losses in these accident years are reported claims and an even smaller proportion are paid losses. In addition, long-tail liability claims are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations and the legal environment. Consequently, the estimation of loss reserves for long-tail coverages is more complex and subject to a higher degree of variability. Reserves for these long-tail coverages represent a significant portion of our overall carried reserves.
When establishing reserves and monitoring reserve adequacy, we analyze historical data and consider the potential impact of various loss development factors and trends including historical loss experience, legislative enactments, judicial decisions, legal developments in imposition of damages, experience with alternative dispute resolution, results of our medical bill review process and changes and trends in general economic conditions, including the effects of inflation. All of these factors influence our estimates of required reserves and for long-tail lines these factors can change over the course of the settlement of the claim. However, there is no precise method for evaluating the specific dollar impact of any individual factor on the development of reserves.
Our reserving philosophy is to reserve claims to their ultimate expected loss amount as soon as practicable after information about a claim becomes available. This approach tends to produce, on average, cautiously pessimistic case reserves, which we expect to result in some level of favorable development over the course of settlement.
2021 Development
The property and casualty insurance business experienced $48.9 million of favorable development in our net reserves for prior accident years for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021. Two lines contributed the majority of favorable development with the largest contribution coming from commercial automobile which had $43.3 million favorable development, followed by workers' compensation which had $10.9 million favorable development. All other individual lines, with the exception of commercial other liability, experienced favorable development. Commercial other liability experienced $20.7 million of unfavorable development. The favorable development for commercial automobile was from both loss and loss adjustment expense ("LAE") where reductions of reserves for unpaid liabilities were more than sufficient to offset actual paid loss and paid LAE. The favorable development for workers compensation was from both loss and LAE and for loss the reductions in reserves for reported claims were more than sufficient to offset paid loss; reductions in reserves for IBNR claims also contributed favorable development in addition to LAE where reductions in reserves more than sufficient to offset payments. Commercial other liability experienced unfavorable development due to paid loss which was greater than reductions in reserves for unpaid loss; LAE developed favorably and partially offset the unfavorable loss development.
2020 Development
The property and casualty insurance business experienced $17.7 million of favorable development in our net reserves for prior accident years for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020. Four lines contributed the majority of favorable development with the largest contribution coming from workers' compensation which had $25.4 million favorable development followed by commercial fire and allied lines which had $10.7 million
favorable development. The two other lines which experienced favorable development were fidelity and surety with $2.1 million favorable development and personal automobile with $1.9 million favorable development. The favorable development for workers' compensation was primarily from reductions in reserves for reported claims which were more than sufficient to offset paid loss. Reductions in reserves for IBNR claims also contributed favorable development in addition to LAE where reductions in reserves more than sufficient to offset payments. Commercial fire and allied lines developed favorably because reductions in reserves for reported claims combined with reductions in reserves for IBNR claims were more than sufficient to offset paid loss; LAE also contributed favorable development with reductions in reserves more than sufficient to offset payments. Fidelity and surety loss developed favorably because a reduction in reserves for IBNR claims was more than sufficient to offset both paid loss and increases in reserves for reported claims. The personal automobile line of business developed favorably because reductions of reserves for reported claims combined with reductions of reserves for IBNR claims were more than sufficient to offset paid loss; LAE also contributed favorable development with reductions in reserves more than sufficient to offset payments. Much of the favorable development was offset by unfavorable development from three lines with the largest contribution coming from commercial liability which experienced $12.8 million unfavorable development. The two other lines which experienced unfavorable development were reinsurance assumed with $6.4 million unfavorable development and commercial automobile with $4.0 million unfavorable development. The commercial liability line of business experienced unfavorable development due to paid loss which was greater than reductions in reserves for unpaid loss; LAE developed favorably and partially offset the unfavorable loss development. The unfavorable development for the reinsurance assumed line of business was due to paid loss which was greater than reductions in reserves for unpaid loss. The commercial automobile line of business experienced unfavorable development because paid loss was greater than reductions in reserves for unpaid loss, but a portion of the unfavorable loss development was offset by favorable development from LAE where payments were more than offset by reductions of reserves for unpaid loss adjustment expense. On an all lines combined basis, favorable development is attributable to LAE which continues to benefit from additional litigation management efforts. The lines of business not mentioned individually above contributed an additional combined total of $0.8 million of favorable development.
2019 Development
The property and casualty insurance business experienced $5.3 million of favorable development in our net reserves for prior accident years for the year ended December 31, 2019. Four lines contributed favorable development with the largest contribution coming from workers' compensation, which had $37.3 million favorable development. The three other lines that experienced favorable development were fidelity and surety with $3.1 million favorable development, commercial fire and allied lines with $2.3 million favorable development, and personal automobile with $1.2 million favorable development. The favorable development for workers' compensation was primarily from reductions in reserves for reported claims which were more than sufficient to offset paid loss; LAE also contributed favorable development with reductions in reserves more than sufficient to offset payments. Fidelity and surety loss developed favorably because reductions in claim reserves and salvage recoveries were more than sufficient to offset loss payments. Commercial fire and allied lines developed favorably due to paid LAE where reductions in reserves for unpaid LAE were more than sufficient to offset payments. Personal automobile developed favorably primarily due to paid LAE where reductions in reserves for unpaid LAE were more than sufficient to offset payments. Much of the favorable development was offset by unfavorable development from two lines with the largest contribution coming from commercial liability which experienced $35.0 million unfavorable development. The other line which experienced unfavorable development was commercial automobile with $3.4 million unfavorable development. Commercial liability experienced unfavorable development primarily due to paid loss which was greater than reductions in reserves for unpaid loss. Paid LAE also contributed to the unfavorable result in commercial liability. Commercial automobile experienced unfavorable development because paid loss was greater than reductions in reserves for unpaid loss, but a portion of the unfavorable loss development was offset by favorable development from LAE. On an all lines combined basis, favorable development is attributable to LAE which continues to benefit from additional litigation management efforts. The lines of business not mentioned individually above contributed an additional total of $0.2 million of unfavorable development in the aggregate.
Reserve development amounts can vary significantly from year-to-year depending on a number of factors, including the number of claims settled and the settlement terms, and are subject to reallocation between accident
years and lines of business.
Net Loss Ratios by Line
The following table depicts our net loss ratios for 2021, 2020 and 2019:
Commercial Lines
The net loss ratio in our commercial lines of business, excluding assumed reinsurance, was 67.0 percent in 2021 compared to 77.8 percent in 2020 and 75.6 percent in 2019. The net loss ratio in 2021 decreased compared to 2020 primarily due to comparatively lower catastrophe losses and a decrease in frequency and severity of commercial auto liability losses. The net loss ratio in 2020 increased compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in catastrophe losses.
Other Liability
Other liability is business insurance covering bodily injury and property damage arising from general business operations, accidents on the insured's premises and products manufactured or sold. Because of the long-tail nature of liability claims, significant periods of time, ranging up to several years, may elapse between the occurrence of the loss, the reporting of the loss to us and the settlement of the claim.
In recent years, we began to use our loss control department more extensively in an attempt to return this line of business to a higher level of profitability. For example, our loss control department has representatives who make multiple visits each year to businesses and job sites to ensure safety. We also do not renew accounts that no longer meet our underwriting or pricing guidelines. We avoid accounts that have become too underpriced for the risk.
Construction Defect Losses
Incurred losses from construction defect claims were $24.6 million in 2021 compared to $14.8 million and $19.4 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2021, we had $86.8 million in construction defect loss and loss settlement expense reserves (excluding IBNR reserves which are calculated at the overall other liability commercial line), which consisted of 4,496 claims. In comparison, at December 31, 2020, we had reserves of $73.6 million, excluding IBNR reserves, consisting of 3,983 claims. Our West Coast region continue to be the origin of the majority of the construction defect claim activity.
Construction defect claims generally relate to allegedly defective work performed in the construction of structures such as apartments, condominiums, single family dwellings or other housing, as well as the sale of defective building materials. Such claims seek recovery due to damage caused by alleged deficient construction techniques or workmanship. The reporting of such claims can be quite delayed due to an extended statute of limitations, sometimes up to ten years. Court decisions have expanded insurers' exposure to construction defect claims as well. Defense costs are also a part of the insured expenses covered by liability policies and can be significant, sometimes greater than the cost of the actual paid claims.
We have exposure to construction defect liabilities in Colorado and surrounding states. We have historically insured small- to medium-sized contractors in this geographic area. In an effort to limit the number of future claims from multi-unit buildings, we implemented policy exclusions in 2009, later revised in 2010, that exclude liability coverage for contractors performing "residential structural" operations on any building project with more than 12 units or on single family homes in any subdivision where the contractor is working on more than 15 homes. The exclusions do not apply to remodeling or repair of an existing structure. We also changed our underwriting guidelines to add a professional liability exclusion when contractors prepare their own design work or blueprints and implemented the multi-family exclusion and tract home building limitation form for the state of Colorado and our other western states as a means to reduce our exposure in future years. When offering commercial umbrella coverage for structural residential contractors, limits of liability are typically limited to a maximum of $2.0 million per occurrence. Requests to provide additional insured status for "developers" are declined.
As a result of our acquisition of Mercer Insurance Group, Inc. in 2011, we added construction defect exposure in the states of California, Nevada and Arizona. Mercer Insurance Group, Inc. has been writing in these states for more than 20 years. In order to minimize our exposure to construction defect claims in this region, we continually review the coverage we offer and our pricing models. In an effort to limit our exposure from residential multi-unit buildings, we started including condominium and townhouse construction policy exclusions in 2012 for our contracting policies in this region. For the majority of our residential contractors we limit the size of any tracts the
contractor is working on to 25 homes or less and do not include a continuous trigger with our designated work exclusion. In a majority of the policies in our small service, repair and remodel contractors program, we have a favorable new residential construction exclusion. We also apply strict guidelines when additional insured forms are required and changed our underwriting guidelines to limit our exposure to large, multi-party construction defect claims.
Commercial Fire and Allied Lines
Commercial fire and allied lines include fire, allied lines, commercial multiple peril and inland marine. The insurance covers losses to an insured's property, including its contents, from weather, fire, theft or other causes. We provide this coverage through a variety of business policies.
The net loss ratio improved 18.8 percentage points in 2021 compared to 2020. The improvement is attributable to a decrease in catastrophe losses in 2021 as compared to 2020.
Commercial Automobile
Our commercial automobile insurance covers physical damage to an insured's vehicle, as well as liabilities to third parties. Automobile physical damage insurance covers loss or damage to vehicles from collision, vandalism, fire, theft, flood or other causes. Automobile liability insurance covers bodily injury, damage to property resulting from automobile accidents caused by the insured, uninsured or under-insured motorists and the legal costs of defending the insured against lawsuits.
The net loss ratio improved 25.1 percentage points in 2021 compared to 2020. The improvement is attributable to a decrease in frequency and severity of commercial auto losses, which is the direct result of our strategic plan to increase the quality of our commercial auto book of business through non renewing underperforming accounts and rate increases.
Workers' Compensation
We consider our workers' compensation business to be a companion product; we rarely write stand-alone workers' compensation policies. Our workers' compensation insurance covers primarily small- to mid-size accounts. The net loss ratio deteriorated 32.2 percentage points in 2021 compared to 2020. This line has experienced an increase in frequency of losses, a decline in rates for several consecutive years and a decrease in favorable prior accident year reserved development, which is a direct results of an improvement in our reserving accuracy.
Competitive market conditions continue in 2021 for workers' compensation business, putting downward pressure on rates. The challenges faced by workers' compensation insurance providers to attain profitability include the regulatory climates in some states that make it difficult to obtain appropriate premium rate increases and inflationary medical costs. Consequently, we have increased the utilization of our loss control unit in the analysis of current risks, with the intention of increasing the quality of our workers' compensation book of business. We are currently using these modeling analytics to assist us in risk selection, and we will continue to evaluate the model results.
Fidelity and Surety
Our surety products guarantee performance and payment by our bonded principals. Our contract bonds protect owners from failure to perform on the part of our principals. In addition, our surety bonds protect material suppliers and subcontractors from nonpayment by our contractors. When surety losses occur, our loss is determined by estimating the cost to complete the remaining work and to pay the contractor's unpaid bills, offset by contract funds due to the contractor, reinsurance, and the value of any collateral to which we may have access.
The net loss ratio deteriorated 6.9 percentage points in 2021 compared to 2020. This line continues to perform above expectations with a low loss ratio of 9.4 percent as compared to 2.5 percent in 2020. The deterioration is due to an increase in severity of losses in 2021 as compared to 2020.
Personal Lines
Our personal lines consist primarily of fire and allied lines (including homeowners) and automobile lines. The net loss ratio improved 33.9 percentage points in 2021 compared to 2020. The improvement is primarily attributable to a decrease in catastrophe losses in 2021 as compared to 2020. Net premiums earned decreased due to the renewal rights agreement for our personal lines business we entered into in May 2020, providing our independent insurance agents with the opportunity to transfer their personal lines policies to Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company beginning in the third quarter of 2020.
Assumed Reinsurance
Our assumed reinsurance portfolio is comprised of contracts that provide reinsurance protection to insurance companies. We only reinsure companies with strong leadership and a sound reputation. The corporate strategy for our reinsurance business is to diversify our overall underwriting risk profile. We capitalize on profitable opportunities and only underwrite programs that are material in size. As part of our underwriting process, we require our reinsurance business to focus on long-term relationships.
Through our disciplined underwriting approach, our assumed reinsurance net written premium grew to $91.3 million in 2021 compared to $31.1 million in 2020. The net loss ratio improved 29.4 percentage points in 2021 compared to 2020. The improvement is attributable to favorable loss experience, attractive reinsurance rates, and a reduction in IBNR reserves. In 2022, we plan to continue to grow our assumed reinsurance business.
Underwriting Expense Ratio
Our underwriting expense ratio, which is a percentage of other underwriting expenses over net premiums earned, was 32.6 percent, 33.5 percent and 32.6 percent for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The decrease in the expense ratio in 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily due to the change in the design of our employee post-retirement benefit plans and a decrease in the acceleration of the amortization of our deferred acquisition costs due to improved profitability in our commercial auto line of business. The increase in the expense ratio during in 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to our continued investment in technology, including our multi-year Oasis project, an upgrade to our technology platform designed to enhance core underwriting decisions, selection of risks and productivity.
Federal Income Taxes
We reported a federal income tax expense on a consolidated basis of $16.3 million or 16.8 percent of pre-tax income in 2021. In 2020, federal income tax benefit on a consolidated basis was $56.8 million or 33.5 percent of pre-tax loss and federal income tax expense on a consolidated basis was $2.1 million or 12.2 percent of pre-tax income in 2019.
On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, permits net operating loss ("NOL") carryovers and carrybacks to offset 100 percent of taxable income for taxable years beginning before 2021. In addition, the CARES Act allows NOLs incurred in 2018, 2019, and 2020 to be carried back to each of the five preceding taxable years to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes. The Company has considered the implications of the CARES Act on its tax provision and has included an income tax benefit of $18.6 million as the result of this Act in 2020.
As of December 31, 2021, we had no alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards.
INVESTMENTS
Investment Environment
2021 began with optimism as a new president took office promising a return to political stability and policy focused on growing the economy and creating opportunity for a greater number of Americans. Economic and capital market expectations were lifted by additional fiscal stimulus and initial vaccination success. Through this period the United States Federal Rserve System ("Federal Reserve") maintained assurances of continued accommodation and transparent forward guidance.
Beginning in late July, the COVID-19 Delta variant swept through major economies and over the course of August and September with case counts, hospitalizations and deaths rivaled prior waves. Another COVID-19 variant (Omicron), emerged late in November and proved even more contagious than Delta. Together, the two variants catalyzed supply-side inflationary pressures, upending the labor force and global supply chains, while the long-anticipated rotation from goods to services spending failed to materialize.
The prospect of inflation beyond "transitory" became the theme in the fourth quarter as consecutive pricing reports broke cycle records going back to the 1980s. Beginning in October, the Federal Reserve started the conversation about tapering asset purchases. In December the taper accelerated, and capital markets began to digest the prospect of three to four rate hikes in 2022, the first of which could occur as soon as the first quarter.
Overall, the investment environment remains challenging with the U.S. equity market seeing stretched valuations only encountered a handful of times in history. Fixed income markets face the prospect of unanchored short-term rate expectations and significant questions surrounding Federal Reserve balance sheet run-off. We believe the risk to consensus expectations is to the downside. While the U.S. consumer continues to appear healthy by nearly all measures, inflationary supply-side pressures are proving stubbornly persistent and increasingly beyond the reach of policy to control. Our investment program is designed specifically to outperform during periods of market uncertainty.
Investment Philosophy
The Company's assets are invested to preserve capital and maximize after-tax returns while maintaining an appropriate balance of risk. The return on our portfolio is an important component of overall financial results, but quality and safety of principal is the highest priority of our investment program. Our general investment philosophy is to purchase financial instruments with the expectation that we will hold them to their maturity. However, active management of our portfolio is considered necessary to appropriately manage risk, achieve portfolio objectives and maximize investment income as market conditions change.
Each of our insurance company subsidiaries develops an appropriate investment strategy that aligns with its business needs and supports United Fire's strategic plan and risk appetite. The portfolio is structured so as to be in
compliance with state insurance laws that prescribe the quality, concentration and type of investments that may be made by insurance companies.
Investment Portfolio
Our invested assets at December 31, 2021 totaled $2,064.7 million, compared to $2,149.2 million at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $84.5 million. At December 31, 2021, fixed maturity securities and equity securities comprised 83.3 percent and 10.3 percent of our investment portfolio, respectively. Because the primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to fund future claims payments, we utilize a conservative investment philosophy, investing in a diversified portfolio of high-quality, intermediate-term taxable corporate bonds, taxable U.S. government and government agency bonds and tax-exempt U.S. municipal bonds. Our overall investment strategy is to stay fully invested (i.e., minimize cash balances). If additional cash is needed we have an ability to borrow funds available under our revolving credit facility.
Composition
We develop our investment strategies based on a number of factors, including estimated duration of reserve liabilities, short- and long-term liquidity needs, projected tax status, general economic conditions, expected rates of inflation and regulatory requirements. We administer our investment portfolio based on investment guidelines approved by management and the investment committee of our Board of Directors that comply with applicable statutory regulations.
The composition of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2021 is presented at carrying value in the following table:
At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, our fixed maturities portfolio is classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale fixed maturity securities are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity. We record convertible redeemable preferred debt securities and equity securities at fair value, with any changes in fair value recognized in earnings.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not have direct exposure to investments in subprime mortgages or other credit enhancement vehicles.
Credit Quality
The following table shows the composition of fixed maturity securities held in our available-for-sale and trading security portfolios by credit rating at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Information contained in the table is generally based upon the issue credit ratings provided by Moody's, unless the rating is unavailable, in which case we obtain it from Standard & Poor's.
Duration
Our investment portfolio is invested primarily in fixed maturity securities whose fair value is susceptible to market risk, specifically interest rate changes. Duration is a measurement used to quantify our inherent interest rate risk and analyze our ability to match our invested assets to our reserve liabilities. If our invested assets and reserve liabilities have similar durations, then any change in interest rates will have an equal effect on these accounts. The primary purpose for matching invested assets and reserve liabilities is liquidity. With appropriate matching, our investments will mature when cash is needed, preventing the need to liquidate other assets prematurely. Mismatches in the duration of assets and liabilities can cause significant fluctuations in our results of operations.
The weighted average effective duration of our portfolio of fixed maturity securities was 3.9 years at December 31, 2021 compared to 3.4 years at December 31, 2020.
The amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale and trading fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2021, by contractual maturity, are shown in the following table. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations may be subject to prepayment risk and are therefore not categorized by contractual maturity.
Investment Results
We invest the premiums received from our policyholders in order to generate investment income, which is an important component of our revenues and profitability. The amount of investment income that we are able to generate is affected by many factors, some of which are beyond our control. Some of these factors are volatility in the financial markets, economic growth, inflation, changes in interest rates, world political conditions, terrorist attacks or threats of terrorism, adverse events affecting other companies in our industry or the industries in which we invest and other unpredictable national or world events. Net investment income increased 40.6 percent in 2021, compared with the same period of 2020 and was primarily due to the change in the fair value of our investments in limited liability partnerships. The valuation of our investments in limited liability partnerships varies from period to period due to current equity market conditions. We expect to maintain our investment philosophy of purchasing quality investments rated investment grade or better.
An allowance for credit losses is recorded based on a number of factors including the current economic conditions, management's expectations of future economic conditions and performance indicators, such as market value vs. amortized cost, investment spreads widening or contracting, rating actions, payment and default history. The following table contains a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses for available-for-sale fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2021:
Changes in unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities do not affect net income and earnings per share but do impact comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and book value per share. We believe that any unrealized losses on our available-for-sale fixed-maturity securities at December 31, 2021 are temporary based upon our current analysis of the issuers of the securities that we hold and current market conditions. We invest in high quality assets to provide protection from future credit quality issues. Non-credit related unrealized gains and losses are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income and represent other market movements that are not credit related, for example interest rate changes. We have no intent to sell, and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell, these securities until the fair value recovers to at least equal our cost basis or the securities mature.
Net Investment Income
In 2021, our investment income, net of investment expenses, increased $16.1 million to $55.8 million as compared to 2020, primarily due to the change in the fair value of our investments in limited liability partnerships.
In 2020, our investment income, net of investment expenses, decreased $20.7 million to $39.7 million as compared to 2019, primarily due to the change in the fair value of our investments in limited liability partnerships, a decrease in interest on fixed maturities and interest on cash and cash equivalents due to declining interest rates.
The following table summarizes the components of net investment income:
(1)Represents the change in value of our interests in limited liability partnerships that are recorded on the equity method of accounting.
In 2021, 66.7 percent of our gross investment income originated from interest on fixed maturities, compared to 96.6 percent and 74.6 percent in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The following table details our annualized yield on average invested assets for 2021 , 2020, and 2019, which is based on our invested assets (including money market accounts) at the beginning and end of the year divided by net investment income:
Net Investment Gains and Losses
The following table summarizes the components of our net investment gains or losses:
Net Unrealized Investment Gains and Losses
As of December 31, 2021, net unrealized investment gains, after tax, totaled $49.8 million compared to unrealized gains of $83.1 million and unrealized gains of $47.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in net unrealized investment gains in 2021 was primarily the result of a decrease in fixed maturity securities held and a change in the value of the fixed maturity portfolio due to higher interest rates during 2021.
The increase in net unrealized investment gains in 2020 was primarily the result of an increase in the
value of the fixed maturity portfolio due to lower interest rates during 2020. The increase in net unrealized investment gains in 2019 was primarily the result of an increase in the value of the fixed maturity portfolio due to lower interest rates during 2019.
The following table summarizes the change in our net unrealized investment gains (losses):
MARKET RISK
Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include financial instruments whose fair values are subject to market risk. The active management of market risk is integral to our operations. Market risk is the potential for loss due to a decrease in the fair value of securities resulting from uncontrollable fluctuations, such as: interest rate risk, equity price risk, foreign exchange risk, credit risk, inflation, or geopolitical conditions. Our primary market risk exposures are: changes in interest rates, deterioration of credit quality in specific issuers, sectors or the economy as a whole, and an unforeseen decrease in the liquidity of securities we hold. We have no foreign exchange risk.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a fixed income maturity security or portfolio of securities to changes in level of interest rates. Generally, there is an inverse relationship between changes in interest rates and changes in the price of a fixed income/maturity security. Plainly stated, if interest rates go up (down), bond prices go down (up). A vast majority of our holdings are fixed income maturity and other interest rate sensitive securities that will decrease (increase) in value as interest rates increase (decrease). While it is generally our intent to hold our investments in fixed maturity securities to maturity, we have classified a majority of our fixed maturity portfolio as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale fixed income maturity securities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with unrealized gains or losses reported net of tax in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. A change in the prevailing interest rates generally translates into a change in the fair value of our fixed income/maturity securities, and by extension, our overall book value.
Market Risk and Duration
We analyze potential changes in the value of our investment portfolio due to the market risk factors noted above within the overall context of asset and liability management. A technique we use in the management of our investment portfolio is the calculation of duration. Our actuaries estimate the payout pattern of our reserve liabilities to determine their duration, which is the present value of the weighted average payments expressed in years. We then establish a target duration for our investment portfolio so that at any given time the estimated cash generated by the investment portfolio will closely match the estimated cash required for the payment of the related reserves. We structure the investment portfolio to meet the target duration to achieve the required cash flow, based on liquidity and market risk factors.
Impact of Interest Rate Changes
The amounts set forth in the following table detail the impact of hypothetical interest rate changes on the fair value of fixed maturity securities held at December 31, 2021. The sensitivity analysis measures the change in fair values arising from immediate changes in selected interest rate scenarios. We employed hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 100 and 200 basis points in the simulations. Additionally, based upon the yield curve shifts, we employ estimates of prepayment speeds for mortgage-related products and the likelihood of call or put options being exercised within the simulations.
The selection of a 100-basis-point and 200-basis-point increase or decrease in interest rates should not be construed as a prediction by our management of future market events, but rather as an illustration of the potential impact of an event.
To the extent actual results differ from the assumptions utilized, our duration and interest rate measures could be significantly affected. As a result, these calculations may not fully capture the impact of nonparallel changes in the relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates.
Equity Price Risk
Equity price risk is the potential loss arising from changes in the fair value (i.e., market price) of equity securities held in our portfolio. Changes in the price of an equity security may be due to a change in the future earnings capacity or strategic outlook of the security issuer, and what investors are willing to pay for those future earnings and related strategy. The carrying values of our equity securities are based on quoted market prices, from an independent source, as of the balance sheet date. Market prices of equity securities, in general, are subject to fluctuations that could cause the amount to be realized upon the future sale of the securities to differ significantly from the current reported value. The fluctuations may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the security issuer, the relative price of alternative investments, general market conditions, and supply/demand factors related to a particular security.
Impact of Price Change
The following table details the effect on the fair value of our investments in equity securities for a positive and negative 10 percent price change at December 31, 2021:
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
Foreign currency exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign exchange rates will impact our transactions with foreign reinsurers relating to the settlement of amounts due to or from foreign reinsurers in the normal course of business. We consider this risk to be immaterial to our operations.
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the willingness and ability of a borrower to repay on time and in full any principal and interest due to the lender. Losses related to credit risk are realized through the income statement and have a direct impact on the earnings of UFG. Given the vast majority of our holdings are fixed income maturity securities, we view credit risk as our primary investment risk. Our internal Investment Department has developed and maintains a rigorous underwriting process to analyze and measure the expected frequency and severity of loss (i.e., credit quality) for government, agency, municipal, structured security, and corporate bond issuers. The objective is to maintain the appropriate balance of risk in our portfolio, consistent with our Investment Policy Statement and conservative investment style, and ensure the portfolio is compensated appropriately for the credit risk it holds. We do have within our municipal bond holdings a small number of securities whose ratings were enhanced by third-party insurance for the payment of principal and interest in the event of an issuer default. Of the insured municipal securities in our investment portfolio, 99.6 percent and 99.5 percent were rated "A" or above, and 96.0 percent and 95.8 percent were rated "AA" or above at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, without the benefit of insurance. Due to the underlying financial strength of the issuers of the securities, we believe that the loss of insurance would not have a material impact on our operations, financial position, or liquidity.
We have no direct exposure in any of the guarantors of our investments. Our largest indirect exposure with a single guarantor totaled $9.4 million or 29.8 percent of our insured municipal securities at December 31, 2021, as compared to $9.7 million or 21.0 percent at December 31, 2020. Our five largest indirect exposures to financial guarantors accounted for $35.6 million and $37.6 million of our municipal securities at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Liquidity measures our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our short- and long-term cash obligations. Our cash inflows are primarily a result of the receipt of premiums, reinsurance recoveries, sales or maturities of investments, and investment income. Cash provided from these sources is used to fund the payment of losses and loss settlement expenses, the purchase of investments, operating expenses, dividends, pension plan contributions, and in recent years, common stock repurchases.
We monitor our capital adequacy to support our business on a regular basis. The future capital requirements of our business will depend on many factors, including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses. Our ability to underwrite is largely dependent upon the quality of our claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent rating agencies. In particular, we require (1) sufficient capital to maintain our financial strength ratings, as issued by various rating agencies, at a level considered necessary by management to enable our insurance company subsidiaries to compete and (2) sufficient capital to enable our insurance company subsidiaries to meet the capital adequacy tests performed by regulatory agencies in the United States.
Cash outflows may be variable because of the uncertainty regarding settlement dates for losses. In addition, the timing and amount of individual catastrophe losses are inherently unpredictable and could increase our liquidity requirements. The timing and amount of reinsurance recoveries may be affected by reinsurer solvency and reinsurance coverage disputes.
Historically, we have generated substantial cash inflows from operations. It is our policy to invest the cash generated from operations in securities with maturities that, in the aggregate, correlate to the anticipated timing of payments for losses and loss settlement expenses. The majority of our assets are invested in available-for-sale fixed maturity securities.
The following table displays a summary of cash sources and uses in 2021, 2020 and 2019:
Our cash flows were sufficient to meet our current liquidity needs for the full-year periods ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 and we anticipate they will be sufficient to meet our future liquidity needs. We also have the ability to draw on our credit facility if needed. See Part II, Item 8, Note 13 "Debt" for more information.
Operating Activities
Net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $29.9 million, $41.4 million and $93.8 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our cash flows from operating activities were sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Investing Activities
Cash in excess of operating requirements is generally invested in fixed maturity securities and equity securities. Fixed maturity securities provide regular interest payments and allow us to match the duration of our liabilities. Equity securities provide dividend income, potential dividend income growth and potential appreciation. For further discussion of our investments, including our philosophy and portfolio, see the "Investment Portfolio" section contained in this Item.
In addition to investment income, possible sales of investments and proceeds from calls or maturities of fixed maturity securities also can provide liquidity. During the next five years, $0.5 billion, or 31.4 percent of our fixed maturity portfolio will mature.
We invest funds required for short-term cash needs primarily in money market accounts, which are classified as cash equivalents. At December 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents included $43.5 million related to these money market accounts, compared to $24.8 million at December 31, 2020.
Net cash flows provided in investing activities totaled $31.7 million in 2021 and used by investing activities totaled $92.9 million and provided in investing activities totaled $4.5 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2021, we had cash inflows from scheduled and unscheduled investment maturities, redemptions, prepayments, and sales of investments that totaled $451.1 million compared to $376.2 million and $311.7 million for the same period in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Our cash outflows for investment purchases totaled $405.4 million in 2021, compared to $450.2 million and $274.7 million for the same period in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Financing Activities
Net cash flows used by financing activities totaled $17.5 million in 2021 and provided in financing activities totaled $18.7 million and used by financing activities totaled $42.0 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The net cash flows used by financing activities in 2021 is primarily the payment of cash dividends of $15.1 million and share repurchases of $2.0 million. The net cash flows provided in financing activities in 2020 is primarily from borrowings of long term debt of $50.0 million offset by the payment of cash dividends of $28.5 million.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The following table shows our contractual obligations and commitments, including our estimated payments due by period at December 31, 2021. Time periods of less than one year are consider short-term cash obligations and time periods greater than one year are considered long-term cash obligations.
Loss and Loss Settlement Expense Reserves
The amounts presented are estimates of the dollar amounts and time periods in which we expect to pay out our gross loss and loss settlement expense reserves. Because the timing of future payments may vary from the stated contractual obligation, these amounts are estimates based upon historical payment patterns and may not represent actual future payments. Refer to "Critical Accounting Policies - Losses and Loss Settlement Expenses" in this section for further discussion.
Long term debt
The Company executed a private placement debt transaction on December 15, 2020 between United Fire & Casualty Company, Federated Mutual Insurance Company, a mutual insurance company domiciled in Minnesota ("Federated Mutual"), and Federated Life Insurance Company, an insurance company domiciled in Minnesota ("Federated Life and together with Federated Mutual, the "Note Purchasers").
UFG sold an aggregate $50.0 million of notes due 2040 to the Note Purchasers. One note with a principal amount of $35.0 million was issued to Federated Mutual and one note with a principal amount of $15.0 million was issued to Federated Life.
Interest payments will be paid quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year (each such date, an “Interest Payment Date”). The interest rate will equal the rate that corresponds to the A.M. Best Co. (or its successor’s) financial strength rating for members of the United Fire & Casualty Pooled Group as of the applicable Interest Payment Date. As of December 31, 2021, interest expense totaled $3,187. Payment of interest is subject to approval by the Iowa Insurance Division.
Operating Leases
Our operating lease obligations are for the rental of office space, vehicles, computer equipment and office equipment. For further discussion of our operating leases, refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 12 "Lease Commitments."
Profit-Sharing Commissions
We offer our agents a profit-sharing plan as an incentive for them to place high-quality property and casualty insurance business with us. Based on business produced by the agencies in 2021, property and casualty agencies expect to receive profit-sharing payments of $15.1 million in 2022.
Pension Plan Payments
We estimate the pension contribution for 2022 in accordance with the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the "Act"). Contributions for future years are dependent on a number of factors, including actual performance versus assumptions made at the time of the actuarial valuations and maintaining certain funding levels relative to regulatory requirements. Contributions in 2022, and in future years, are expected to be at least equal to the IRS minimum required contribution in accordance with the Act.
Commitments for Capital Expenditures
Dividends
Dividends paid to shareholders totaled $15.1 million, $28.5 million and $32.7 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our practice has been to pay quarterly cash dividends, which we have paid every quarter since March 1968.
Payments of any future dividends and the amounts of such dividends, however, will depend upon factors such as net income, financial condition, capital requirements, and general business conditions. We will only pay dividends if declared by our Board of Directors out of legally available funds.
As a holding company with no independent operations of its own, United Fire Group, Inc. relies on dividends received from its insurance company subsidiaries in order to pay dividends to its common shareholders. Dividends payable by our insurance subsidiaries are governed by the laws in the states in which they are domiciled. In all cases, these state laws permit the payment of dividends only from earned surplus arising from business operations. For example, under Iowa law, the maximum dividend or distribution that may be paid within a 12-month period without prior approval of the Iowa Insurance Commissioner is generally restricted to the greater of 10 percent of statutory surplus as of the preceding December 31, or net income of the preceding calendar year on a statutory basis, not greater than earned statutory surplus. Other states in which our insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled may impose similar restrictions on dividends and distributions. Based on these restrictions, at December 31, 2021, our insurance company subsidiary, United Fire & Casualty, is able to make a maximum of $57.2 million in dividend payments without prior regulatory approval. These restrictions are not expected to have a material impact in meeting our cash obligations.
Share Repurchases
Under our share repurchase program, first announced in August 2007, we may purchase our common stock from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The amount and timing of any purchases will be at our discretion and will depend upon a number of factors, including the share price, economic and general market conditions, and corporate and regulatory requirements. Our share repurchase program may be modified or discontinued at any time.
During 2021, 2020 and 2019, pursuant to authorization by our Board of Directors, we repurchased 67,651, 70,467, and 258,756 shares of our common stock, respectively, which used cash totaling $2.0 million in 2021, $2.7 million in 2020 and $11.7 million in 2019. At December 31, 2021, we were authorized to purchase an additional 1,719,326 shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program, which expires in August 2022.
Credit Facilities
Information specific to our credit facilities is incorporated by reference from Note 13 "Debt" contained in Part II, Item 8. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the Credit Agreement (the
“Credit Agreement”) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ("Wells Fargo"), as administrative agent (the "Administrative Agent"), issuing lender, swing-line lender and lender, and the other lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively with Wells Fargo, the "Lenders").
Stockholders' Equity
Stockholders' equity increased 6.5 percent to $879.1 million at December 31, 2021, from $825.1 million at December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily attributed to net income of $80.6 million and change in liability for employee benefit plans of $20.7 million, partially offset by stockholder dividends of $15.1 million and a decrease in net unrealized investment gains net of tax of $33.3 million. As of December 31, 2021, the book value per share of our common stock was $35.05, compared to $32.93 at December 31, 2020.
Risk-Based Capital
The NAIC adopted risk-based capital requirements, which requires us to calculate a minimum capital requirement for each of our insurance companies based on individual company insurance risk factors. These "risk-based capital" results are used by state insurance regulators to identify companies that require regulatory attention or the initiation of regulatory action. At December 31, 2021, all of our insurance companies had capital well in excess of required levels.
Funding Commitments
We hold investments in limited liability partnerships as part of our investment strategy. Pursuant to agreements with our limited liability partnership investments, we are contractually committed through July 10, 2030 to make capital contributions upon request of the partnerships. Our remaining potential contractual obligation was $11.1 million at December 31, 2021.
In addition, the Company invested $25,000 in December 2019 in a limited liability partnership investment fund which is subject to a 3-year lockup with a 60 day minimum notice, with 4 possible repurchase dates per year, after the 3-year lockup period is met. The fair value of the investment at December 31, 2021 was $24,771 and there are no remaining capital contributions with this investment.
These partnerships are included in our other long term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with a current fair value of $84.1 million, or 4.1% of our total invested assets, at December 31, 2021.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are representative of significant judgments and uncertainties and that may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We base our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition on the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements, which we have prepared in accordance with GAAP. As we prepare these Consolidated Financial Statements, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe our most critical accounting policies are as follows.
Investment Valuation
Upon acquisition, we classify investments in marketable securities as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading. We record investments in available-for-sale and trading fixed maturity securities and equity securities at fair value. Other long-term investments consist primarily of our interests in limited liability partnerships that are recorded on the equity method of accounting. We record mortgage loans at their amortized cost less any valuation allowance.
In general, investment securities are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate risk, credit risk, and overall market volatility risk. Therefore, it is reasonably possible that changes in the fair value of our investment securities that are reported at fair value will occur in the near term and such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, it is reasonably possible that changes in the value of our investments in trading securities and limited liability partnerships could occur in the future and such changes could materially affect our results of operations as reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Fair Value Measurement
Information specific to the fair value measurement of our financial instruments and disclosures is incorporated by reference from Note 3 "Fair Value of Financial Instruments" contained in Part II, Item 8.
Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs ("DAC")
We record an asset for certain costs of underwriting new business, primarily commissions, premium taxes and variable underwriting and policy issue expenses that have been deferred. The amount of underwriting compensation expense eligible for deferral is based on time studies and a ratio of success in policy placement. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, our DAC asset was $91.4 million and $87.1 million, respectively.
The DAC asset is amortized over the life of the policies written, generally one year. We assess the recoverability of DAC on a quarterly basis by line of business. This assessment is performed by comparing recorded unearned premium to the sum of unamortized DAC and estimates of expected losses and loss settlement expenses. If the sum of these costs exceeds the amount of recorded unearned premium (i.e., the line of business is expected to generate an operating loss), the excess is recognized in current period other underwriting expenses as an offset against the established DAC asset. We refer to this offset as a premium deficiency charge.
To calculate the premium deficiency charge by line of business, we estimate an expected loss and loss settlement expense ratio which is based on our best estimate of future losses for each line of business. This calculation is performed on a quarterly basis and developed in conjunction with our quarterly reserving process. The expected loss and loss settlement expense ratios are the only assumptions we utilize in our premium deficiency calculation. Changes in these assumptions can have a significant impact on the amount of premium deficiency charge recognized for a line of business. The premium deficiency calculation is aggregated by line of business in a manner consistent with how the policies are currently being marketed and managed.
The following table illustrates the hypothetical impact on the premium deficiency charge recorded for the quarter ended December 31, 2021, of reasonably likely changes in the assumed loss and loss settlement expense ratios utilized for purposes of this calculation. The entire impact of these changes would be recognized through income as other underwriting expenses. The following table illustrates the impact of potential changes in the expected loss and loss settlement expense ratios for all lines of business on the premium deficiency charge. The base amount indicated below is the actual premium deficiency charge recorded as an offset against the DAC asset established as of the quarter ended December 31, 2021:
Actual future results could differ materially from our assumptions used to calculate the recorded DAC asset. Changes in our assumed loss and loss settlement expense ratios in the future would impact the amount of deferred costs in the period such changes in assumptions are made. The premium deficiency charge calculated for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 was $2.9 million compared to the premium deficiency charge of $1.5 million calculated for the same period of 2020.
Losses and Loss Settlement Expenses
Reserves for losses and loss settlement expenses are reported using our best estimate of ultimate liability for claims that occurred prior to the end of any given reporting period, but have not yet been paid. Before credit for reinsurance recoverables, these reserves were $1,514.3 million and $1,578.1 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We purchase reinsurance to mitigate the impact of large losses and catastrophic events. Loss and loss settlement expense reserves ceded to reinsurers were $112.9 million for 2021 and $131.8 million for 2020. Our reserves, before credit for reinsurance recoverables, by line of business as of December 31, 2021, were as follows:
Case-Basis Reserves
For each of our lines of business, with respect to reported claims, we establish reserves on a case-by-case basis. Our experienced claims personnel estimate these case-basis reserves using adjusting guidelines established by management. Our goal is to set the case-basis reserves at the ultimate expected loss amount as soon as possible after information about the claim becomes available.
Establishing the case reserve for an individual claim is subjective and complex, requiring us to estimate future payments and values that will be sufficient to settle an individual claim. Setting a reserve for an individual claim is an inherently uncertain process. When we establish and adjust individual claim reserves, we do so based on our knowledge of the circumstances and facts of the claim. Upon notice of a claim, we establish a preliminary (average claim cost) reserve based on the limited claim information initially reported. Subsequently, we conduct an investigation of each reported claim, which allows us to more fully understand the factors contributing to the loss and our potential exposure. This investigation may extend over a long period of time. As our claim investigation progresses, and as our claims personnel identify trends in claims activity, we may refine and adjust our estimates of case reserves. To evaluate and refine our overall reserving process, we track and monitor all claims until they are settled and paid in full, with all salvage and subrogation claims being resolved.
Most of our insurance policies are written on an occurrence basis that provides coverage if a loss occurs during the policy period, even if the insured reports the loss many years later. For example, some liability claims for construction defect coverage are reported 10 years or more after the policy period, and the workers' compensation coverage provided by our policies pays unlimited medical benefits for the duration of the claimant's injury up to the lifetime of the claimant. In addition, final settlement of certain claims can be delayed for years due to litigation or other reasons. Reserves for these claims require us to estimate future costs, including the effect of judicial actions,
litigation trends and medical cost inflation, among others. Reserve development can occur over time as conditions and circumstances change many years after the policy was issued and/or the loss occurred.
Our loss reserves include amounts related to both short-tail and long-tail lines of business. "Tail" refers to the time period between the occurrence of a loss and the ultimate settlement of the claim. A short-tail insurance product is one where ultimate losses are known and settled comparatively quickly. Ultimate losses under a long-tail insurance product are sometimes not known and settled for many years. The longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim, the more the ultimate settlement amount can vary from the reserves initially established. Accordingly, long-tail insurance products can have significant implications on the reserving process.
Our short-tail lines of business include fire and allied lines, homeowners, commercial property, auto physical damage and inland marine. The amounts of the case-based reserves that we establish for claims in these lines depend upon various factors, such as individual claim facts (including type of coverage and severity of loss), our historical loss experience and trends in general economic conditions (including changes in replacement costs, medical costs and inflation).
For short-tail lines of business, the estimation of case-basis loss reserves is less complex than for long-tail lines because the claims relate to tangible property. Because of the relatively short time from claim occurrence to settlement, actual losses typically do not vary significantly from reserve estimates.
Our long-tail lines of business include workers' compensation and other liability. In addition, certain product lines such as commercial auto, commercial multi-peril and surety include both long-tail coverages and short-tail coverages. For many long-tail liability claims, significant periods of time, ranging up to several years, may elapse between the occurrence of the loss, the reporting of the loss to us and the settlement of the claim. As a result, loss experience in the more recent accident years for the long-tail liability coverages has limited statistical credibility in our reserving process because a relatively small proportion of losses in these accident years are reported claims and an even smaller proportion are paid losses. In addition, long-tail liability claims are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations and the legal environment. Consequently, the estimation of loss reserves for long-tail coverages is more complex and subject to a higher degree of variability than for short-tail coverages.
The amounts of the case-basis loss reserves that we establish for claims in long-tail lines of business depends upon various factors, including individual claim facts (including type of coverage, severity of loss and underlying policy limits), company historical loss experience, changes in underwriting practice, legislative enactments, judicial decisions, legal developments in the awarding of damages, changes in political attitudes and trends in general economic conditions, including inflation. As with our short-tail lines of business, we review and make changes to long-tail case-based reserves based on our review of continually evolving facts as they become available to us during the claims settlement process. Our adjustments to case-based reserves are reported in the financial statements in the period that new information arises about the claim. Examples of facts that become known that could cause us to change our case-based reserves include, but are not limited to: evidence that loss severity is different than previously assessed; new claimants who have presented claims; and the assessment that no coverage exists.
Incurred But Not Reported Reserves
On a quarterly basis, the Company's internal actuary performs a detailed analysis of IBNR reserves. This analysis uses various loss projection methods to provide several estimates of ultimate loss (or loss adjustment expense (LAE)) for each individual year and line of business. The loss projection methods include paid loss development; reported loss development; expected loss emergence based on paid losses; and expected loss emergence based on reported losses. The two methods utilized by our internal actuary to project loss settlement expenses are paid expenses development and development of the ratio of paid expense versus paid loss. Results of the projection methods are compared and a point estimate of ultimate loss (or LAE) is established for each individual year and line of business. The specific projection methods used to establish point estimates vary depending on what is deemed most appropriate for a particular line of business and year. Results of these methods are usually averaged together to provide a final point estimate. Given that there are several inputs depending on the line of business, the methods
may be averaged and modified based on changes known to management or trends in the market. IBNR estimates are derived by subtracting reported loss from the final point estimate loss.
Senior management meets with our internal actuary and controller quarterly to review the adequacy of carried IBNR reserves based on results from this actuarial analysis and makes adjustments for changes in business and other factors not completely captured by the data within the actuarial analysis. There are two fundamental types or sources of IBNR reserves. We record IBNR for "normal" types of claims and also specific IBNR reserves related to unique circumstances or events. A major hurricane is an example of an event that might necessitate specific IBNR reserves because an analysis of existing historical data would not provide an appropriate estimate. This method of establishing our IBNR reserves has consistently resulted in aggregate reserve levels that management believes are reasonable in comparison to the reserve estimates indicated by the actuarial analysis.
For our short-tail lines of business, IBNR reserves constitute a small portion of the overall reserves. These claims are generally reported and settled shortly after the loss occurs. In our long-tail lines of business, IBNR reserves constitute a relatively higher proportion of total reserves, because, for many liability claims, significant periods of time may elapse between the initial occurrence of the loss, the reporting of the loss to us, and the ultimate settlement of the claim.
Loss Settlement Expense Reserves
Loss settlement expense reserves include amounts ultimately allocable to individual claims, as well as amounts required for the general overhead of the claims handling operation that are not specifically allocable to individual claims. We do not establish loss settlement expense reserves on a claim-by-claim basis. Instead, on a quarterly basis, our internal actuary performs a detailed statistical analysis (using historical data) to estimate the required reserve for unpaid loss settlement expenses. On a monthly basis, the required reserve estimate is adjusted to reflect additional earned exposure and expense payments that have occurred subsequent to completion of the quarterly analysis.
LAE is composed of two distinct kinds of expenses which are allocated LAE ("ALAE") and unallocated LAE ("ULAE"). These two expense types have different purposes and characteristics which necessitates different estimation methods in order to provide a valid quarterly estimate of the required reserve for unpaid expense which is generally referred to as an LAE IBNR reserve.
Reserves for unpaid ALAE are estimated quarterly by line of business for each individual accident year using three methods: (1) Paid development, (2) Expected emergence of ALAE, and (3) Development of the ratio of paid ALAE to paid loss. Each of the three methods produces an estimate of the ultimate ALAE cost for an individual accident year and the final estimate is generally a weighted average of the various methods. Inception to date paid ALAE is subtracted from the final ultimate ALAE estimate to provide the estimated ALAE IBNR reserve for each individual accident year.
Reserves for unpaid ULAE are estimated quarterly by line of business for each individual accident year using a single method. This method consists of applying a percentage factor to unpaid loss reserves. The percentage factor used differs by line of business and is evaluated and established on an annual basis using year-end data. The percentage factor is evaluated and selected after reviewing the ratio of paid ULAE to paid loss using calendar year data for the most recent five years.
Generally, the loss settlement expense reserves for long-tail lines of business are a greater portion of the overall reserves, as there are often substantial legal fees and other costs associated with the complex liability claims that are associated with long-tail coverages. Because short-tail lines of business settle much more quickly and the costs are easier to determine, loss settlement expense reserves for such claims constitute a smaller portion of the total reserves.
Reinsurance Reserves
The estimation of assumed and ceded reinsurance loss and loss settlement expense reserves is subject to the same factors as the estimation of loss and loss settlement expense reserves. In addition to those factors, which give rise to
inherent uncertainties in establishing loss and loss settlement expense reserves, there exists a delay in our receipt of reported claims for assumed business due to the procedure of having claims first reported through one or more intermediary insurers or reinsurers.
Reserves for assumed reinsurance are established using methods and techniques identical to those used for direct lines of business. The additional delay inherent in assumed reinsurance reporting is considered in our reserving process and payment is not problematic. Assumed reinsurance, like every independent line of business, has unique reporting and payment patterns that are reviewed as part of the reserve estimation process.
There are three distinct types of reserves ceded to reinsurers: (1) reported claim reserves, (2) loss IBNR, and (3) LAE IBNR. Ceded reserves for reported claims are calculated by subtracting the primary retention from the claim value established by our claim adjuster. Ceded loss IBNR originates from our boiler and machinery business which is 100 percent reinsured. For this business ceded loss IBNR is equal to direct loss IBNR. Boiler and machinery business is included in our commercial fire and allied line of business. We will cede some LAE expenses when we cede loss. Our ceded LAE IBNR is estimated based on our ceded unpaid loss reserves and the general relation, by line of business, between LAE and loss. Our primary retention was $2.0 million for 2012 through 2015 and increased to $2.5 million for 2016 through 2021.
Key Assumptions
Our internal and external actuaries and management use a number of key assumptions in establishing an estimate of loss and loss settlement expense reserves, including the following assumptions: future loss settlement expenses can be estimated based on the Company's historical ratios of loss settlement expenses paid to losses; the Company's case-basis reserves reflect the most up-to-date information available about the unique circumstances of each individual claim; no new judicial decisions or regulatory actions will increase our case-basis obligations; historical aggregate claim reporting and payment patterns will continue into the future consistent with the observable past; significant unique and unusual claim events have been identified and appropriate adjustments have been made; and, to the best of our knowledge, there are no new latent trends that would impact our case-basis reserves.
Our key assumptions are subject to change as actual claims occur and as we gain additional information about the variables that underlie our assumptions. Accordingly, management reviews and updates these assumptions periodically to ensure that the assumptions continue to be valid. If necessary, management makes changes not only in the estimates derived from the use of these assumptions, but also in the assumptions themselves. Due to the inherent uncertainty in the loss reserving process, management believes that there is a reasonable chance that modification to key assumptions could individually, or in aggregate, result in reserve levels that are either significantly above or below the actual amount for which the related claims will eventually settle.
As an example, if our loss and loss settlement expense reserves of $1,514.3 million as of December 31, 2021, is 10.0 percent inadequate, we would experience a reduction in future pre-tax earnings of up to $151.4 million. This reduction could be recorded in one year or multiple years, depending on when we identify the deficiency. The deficiency would also affect our financial position in that our equity would be reduced by an amount equivalent to the reduction in net income. Any deficiency that would be recognized in our loss and loss settlement expense reserves usually does not have a material effect on our liquidity because the claims have not been paid. Conversely, if our estimates of ultimate unpaid loss and loss settlement expense reserves prove to be redundant, our future earnings and financial position would be improved. We believe our reserving philosophy, coupled with what we believe to be aggressive and successful claims management and loss settlement practices, has resulted in year-to-year redundancies in reserves. We believe our approach produces recorded reserves that are reasonable as to their relative position within a range of reasonable reserves from year-to-year.
We are unable to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in our key assumptions utilized to establish individual case-basis reserves on our total reported reserves because the impact of these changes would be unique to each specific case-basis reserve established. However, based on historical experience, we believe that aggregate case-basis reserve volatility levels of 5.0 percent and 10.0 percent can be attributed to the ultimate development of our net case-basis reserves. The impact to pre-tax earnings would be a decrease if the reserves were to be adjusted upwards
and an increase if the reserves were to be adjusted downwards. The table below details the impact of this development volatility on our reported net case-basis reserves at December 31, 2021:
Due to the formula-based nature of our IBNR and loss settlement expense reserve calculations, changes in the key assumptions utilized to generate these reserves can impact our reported results. It is not possible to isolate and measure the potential impact of just one of these factors, and future loss trends could be partially impacted by all factors concurrently. Nevertheless, it is meaningful to view the sensitivity of the reserves to potential changes in these variables such as claim frequency and severity. To demonstrate the sensitivity of reserves to changes in significant assumptions, the following example is presented. The amounts reflect the pre-tax impact on earnings from a hypothetical percentage change in the calculation of IBNR and loss settlement expense reserves at December 31, 2021. The impact to pre-tax earnings would be a decrease if the reserves were to be adjusted upwards and an increase if the reserves were to be adjusted downwards. We believe that the changes presented are reasonably likely based upon an analysis of our historical IBNR and loss settlement expense reserve experience.
In 2021, we did not change the key method through which we develop our assumptions on which we based our reserving calculations. In estimating our 2021 loss and loss settlement expense reserves, we did not anticipate future events or conditions that were inconsistent with past development patterns.
Certain of our lines of business are subject to the potential for greater loss and loss settlement expense development than others, which are discussed below:
Other Liability Reserves
Other liability is considered a long-tail line of business, as it can take a relatively long period of time to settle claims from prior accident years. This is partly due to the lag time between the date a loss or event occurs that triggers coverage and the date when the claim is actually reported. Defense costs are also a part of the insured expenses covered by liability policies and can be significant, sometimes greater than the cost of the actual paid claims. For the majority of our products, defense costs are outside of the policy limit, meaning that the amounts paid for defense costs are not subtracted from the available policy limit.
Factors that can cause reserve uncertainty in estimating reserves in this line include: reporting time lags; the number of parties involved in the underlying tort action; whether the "event" triggering coverage is confined to only one time period or is spread over multiple time periods; the potential dollars involved in the individual claim actions; whether such claims were reasonably foreseeable and intended to be covered at the time the contracts were written (i.e., coverage disputes); and the potential for mass claim actions.
Claims with longer reporting time lags may result in greater inherent risk. This is especially true for alleged claims with a latency feature, particularly where courts have ruled that coverage is spread over multiple policy years, hence involving multiple defendants (and their insurers and reinsurers) and multiple policies (thereby increasing the potential dollars involved and the underlying settlement complexity). Claims with long latencies also increase the
potential time lag between writing a policy in a certain market and the recognition that such policy has potential mass tort and/or latent claim exposure.
Our reserve for other liability claims at December 31, 2021, was $671.0 million and consisted of 5,113 claims, compared with $652.3 million, consisting of 5,895 claims at December 31, 2020. Of the $671.0 million total reserve for other liability claims, $151.3 million is identified as defense costs and $36.3 million is identified as general overhead required in the settlement of claims.
Included in the other liability line of business are gross reserves for construction defect losses and loss settlement expenses. Construction defect is a liability allegation relating to defective work performed in the construction of structures such as commercial buildings, apartments, condominiums, single family dwellings or other housing, as well as the sale of defective building materials. These claims seek recovery due to damage caused by alleged deficient construction techniques or workmanship. At December 31, 2021, we had $86.8 million in construction defect loss and loss settlement expense reserves, excluding IBNR reserves that are calculated for the overall other liability commercial line, which consisted of 4,496 claims. At December 31, 2020, our reserves, excluding IBNR reserves, totaled $73.6 million, which consisted of 3,983 claims. The reporting of such claims can be delayed, as the statute of limitations can be up to 10 years. Court decisions in recent years have expanded insurers' exposure to construction defect claims. As a result, claims may be reported more than 10 years after a project has been completed, as litigation can proceed for several years before an insurance company is identified as a potential contributor. Claims have also emerged from parties claiming additional insured status on policies issued to other parties, such as contractors seeking coverage from a subcontractor's policy.
In addition to these issues, other variables also contribute to a high degree of uncertainty in establishing reserves for construction defect claims. These variables include: whether coverage exists; when losses occur; the size of each loss; expectations for future interpretive rulings concerning contract provisions; and the extent to which the assertion of these claims will expand geographically. In recent years, we have implemented various underwriting measures that we anticipate will mitigate the amount of construction defect losses experienced. These initiatives include increased care regarding additional insured endorsements; stricter underwriting guidelines on the writing of residential contractors; and an increased utilization of loss control.
Asbestos and Environmental Reserves
Included in the other liability and assumed reinsurance lines of business are reserves for asbestos and other environmental losses and loss settlement expenses. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $2.5 million and $2.5 million, respectively, in direct and assumed asbestos and environmental loss reserves. The estimation of loss reserves for environmental claims and claims related to long-term exposure to asbestos and other substances is one of the most difficult aspects of establishing reserves, especially given the inherent uncertainties surrounding such claims. Although we record our best estimate of loss and loss settlement expense reserves, the ultimate amounts paid upon settlement of such claims may be more or less than the amount of the reserves, because of the significant uncertainties involved and the likelihood that these uncertainties will not be resolved for many years.
Commercial Auto Reserves
Commercial auto claim reserves are established at exposure based on information either known and provided or obtained through the investigation, with some pessimism built in. Incorporated are the perspective and experience the claims staff has acquired, which may include assumptions as to how the claim will develop over time, and with a slightly pessimistic view. Exposures are identified and reserves established within 30 to 60 days depending on the complexity of the case.
Workers' Compensation Reserves
Like the other liability line of business, workers' compensation losses and loss settlement expense reserves are based upon variables that create imprecision in estimating the ultimate reserve. Estimates for workers' compensation are particularly sensitive to assumptions about medical cost inflation, which has been steadily increasing over the past few years. Other variables that we consider and that contribute to the uncertainty in establishing reserves for
workers' compensation claims include: state legislative and regulatory environments; trends in jury awards; and mortality rates. Because of these variables, the process of reserving for the ultimate loss and loss settlement expense to be incurred requires the use of informed judgment and is inherently uncertain. Consequently, actual loss and loss settlement expense reserves may deviate from our estimates. Such deviations may be significant. Our reserve for workers' compensation claims at December 31, 2021 was $167.1 million and consisted of 2,028 claims, compared with $173.6 million, consisting of 3,192 claims, at December 31, 2020.
Reserve Development
The following reserve development section should be read in conjunction with the "Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019" section of this Item 7.
In 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized a favorable development in our net reserves for prior accident years totaling $48.9 million, $17.7 million and $5.3 million, respectively.
The factors contributing to our year-to-year redundancy include: establishing reserves at their ultimate expected loss amount as soon as practicable after information becomes available, which produces, on average, cautiously pessimistic case reserves; using claims negotiation to control the size of settlements; assuming that we have liability for all claims, even though the issue of liability may, in some cases, be resolved in our favor; promoting claims management services to encourage return-to-work programs; case management by nurses for serious injuries and management of medical provider services and billings; and using programs and services to help prevent fraud and to assist in favorably resolving cases.
Based upon our comparison of carried reserves to actual claims experience over the last several years, we believe that using our Company's historical premium and claims data to establish reserves for losses and loss settlement expenses results in adequate and reasonable reserves. Reserve development is discussed in more detail under the heading "Reserve Development" in the "Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019" section in this Item 7.
The following table details the pre-tax impact on our property and casualty insurance business' financial results and financial condition of reasonably likely reserve development. Our lines of business that have historically been most susceptible to significant volatility in reserve development have been shown separately and utilize hypothetical levels of volatility of 5.0 percent and 10.0 percent. Our other, less volatile, lines of business have been aggregated and utilize hypothetical levels of volatility of 3.0 percent and 5.0 percent.
Independent Actuary
We engage an independent actuarial firm to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of the statutory reserves internal management establishes. During 2021 and 2020, we engaged the services of Regnier as our independent actuarial firm for the property and casualty insurance business. We anticipate that this engagement will continue in 2022.
It is management's policy to utilize staff adjusters to develop our estimate of case-basis loss reserves. IBNR and loss settlement expense reserves are established through various formulae that utilize pertinent, recent Company historical data. The calculations are supplemented with knowledge of current trends and events that could result in adjustments to the level of IBNR and loss settlement expense reserves. On a quarterly basis, we compare our estimate of total reserves to the estimates prepared by Regnier by line of business to ensure that our estimates are within the actuary's acceptable range. Regnier performs a review of loss and loss settlement expense reserves at each year end using generally accepted actuarial guidelines to ensure that the recorded reserves appear reasonable. Our net reserves for losses and loss settlement expenses as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $1,401.4 million and $1,446.3 million, respectively. In 2021 and 2020, after considering the independent actuary's range of reasonable estimates, management believes that carried reserves were reasonable and therefore did not adjust the recorded amount.
Regnier uses four projection methods in its actuarial analysis of our loss reserves and uses two projection methods in its actuarial analysis of our loss settlement expense reserves. Based on the results of the projection methods, the actuaries select an actuarial point estimate of the reserves, which is compared to our carried reserves to evaluate the reasonableness of the carried reserves. The four methods utilized by Regnier to project losses are: paid loss development; reported loss development; expected loss emergence based on paid losses; and expected loss emergence based on reported losses. The two methods utilized by Regnier to project loss expenses are: paid expenses-to-paid loss and paid expense-to-ultimate loss.
Pension and Post-Retirement Benefit Obligations
The process of estimating our pension and post-retirement benefit obligations and related benefit expense is inherently uncertain, and the actual cost of benefits may vary materially from the estimates recorded. These liabilities are particularly volatile due to their long-term nature and are based on several assumptions. The main assumptions used in the valuation of our benefit obligations are: estimated mortality of the employees and retirees eligible for benefits; estimated expected long-term rates of return on investments; estimated compensation increases; estimated employee turnover; estimated medical expense trend rate; and estimated rate used to discount the ultimate estimated liability to a present value. We engage a consulting actuary from Principal Financial Group, an independent firm, to assist in evaluating and establishing assumptions used in the valuation of our benefit obligations.
A change in any one or more of these assumptions is likely to result in an ultimate liability different from the original actuarial estimate. Such changes in estimates may be material. For example, a 100 basis point decrease in our estimated discount rate would increase the pension at December 31, 2021 by $50.4 million while a 100 basis point increase in the rate would decrease the benefit obligation $39.3 million.
A 100 basis point decrease in our estimated long-term rate of return on pension plan assets would increase the benefit expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, by $2.8 million, while a 100 basis point increase in the rate would decrease benefit expense by $2.8 million, for the same period.
The post-retirement benefit obligation is less than $1.0 million at December 31, 2021 due to the plan closure at the end of 2022, therefore any change in the discount rate will be immaterial to the benefit obligation.
Goodwill
As described in Part II, Item 8, Note 14 "Intangible Assets," the Company performed a quantitative impairment analysis on its one reporting unit and recognized an impairment charge of $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually, during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. The Company used a weighting of the income and market approaches to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. The impairment was based on the following factors: (i) disruptions in the equity markets, specifically for property and casualty insurance companies, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and due to the current year weather related catastrophes; and (ii) the fair value of our stock trading significantly below book value.
The Company's quantitative goodwill impairment test involved estimating the fair value of the Company, which was sensitive to significant assumptions, such as forecasted revenues and loss and loss settlement expenses, discount rate, and terminal growth rate which are used in the income approach and comparable publicly traded companies and estimated valuation multiples which are used in the market approach.
