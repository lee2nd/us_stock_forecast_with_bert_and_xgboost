ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion of financial condition, result of operations, liquidity and capital resources and certain factors that may affect future results, including economic and industry-wide factors, should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included herein.
Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenue
The core consumer finance products we offer include Revolving LOC and Installment loans. Revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations includes: interest income, MDR, finance charges, CSO fees, insurance revenue, late fees and non-sufficient funds fees. Product offerings differ by jurisdiction and are governed by the laws in each jurisdiction.
Revolving LOC loans are lines of credits without specified maturity dates and include our POS financing products at Flexiti. We record revenue from Revolving LOC loans on a simple-interest basis. Revolving LOC revenues include interest income on outstanding revolving balances and other usage or maintenance fees as permitted by underlying statutes. Accrued interest and fees are included in "Gross loans receivable" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Revolving LOC revenues also include MDR, which represents a fee charged to merchant partners to facilitate customer purchases at merchant locations. The fee is recorded as unearned revenue when received and recognized over the expected loan term.
Historically, Installment loans range from unsecured, short-term, small-denomination loans, whereby a customer receives cash in exchange for a post-dated personal check or pre-authorized debit from the customer's bank account, to fixed-term, fully amortizing loans with a fixed payment amount due each period during the term of the loan. With the acquisition of Heights in December 2021, we now offer long-term large loans to customers. For our short-term, small denomination loans, we recognize revenue on a constant-yield basis ratably over the team of each loan. We defer and recognize unearned fees over the remaining term of the loan at the end of each reporting period. Revenues from these short-term loans represent deferred presentment or other fees as defined by the underlying state, provincial, or national regulations. For our fixed-term, fully amortizing loans, we record revenues on a simple-interest basis. Revenue for fixed-term Installment loans includes interest income from Company-Owned loans, CSO fees, and non-sufficient funds or returned-items fees on late or defaulted payments on past-due loans, known as late fees. Late fees comprise less than 1% of Installment revenues. Accrued interest and fees are included in "Gross loans receivable" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
We also provide a number of ancillary financial products, including optional credit protection insurance, check cashing, demand deposit accounts, and money transfer services. Heights offers optional insurance products to its customers in connection with its lending operations, including credit life, credit accident and health, credit property insurance and credit involuntary unemployment insurance with the policies written by unaffiliated third-party insurance companies. Insurance commissions, written in connection with certain loans, are credited to unearned insurance commissions and recognized as income over the life of the related insurance contracts, using a method similar to that used for the recognition of interest income.
Provision for Losses
Credit losses are an inherent part of outstanding loans receivable. We maintain an allowance for loan losses for loans and interest receivable at a level estimated to be adequate to absorb such losses based primarily on our analysis of historical loss rates by products containing similar risk characteristics. The allowance for losses on our Company-Owned gross loans receivables reduces the outstanding gross loans receivables balance in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The liability for estimated incurred losses related to loans originated by third-party lenders through CSO programs, which we guarantee but do not include in the Consolidated Financial Statements (referred to as "Guaranteed by the Company"), is reported in "Liability for losses on CSO lender-owned consumer loans" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Increases in either the allowance or the liability, net of charge-offs and recoveries, are recorded as “Provision for losses” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Operating Expense
Our primary categories of operating expense are as follows:
•Salaries and Benefits-includes salaries and personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses and share-based compensation expense for both store and corporate costs.
•Occupancy-includes rent expense on our leased facilities and equipment, utilities, insurance and certain maintenance expenses for both store and corporate costs.
•Advertising-costs are expensed as incurred and include costs associated with attracting, retaining and/or reactivating customers as well as creating brand awareness. We have internal creative, web and print design capabilities and if we outsource these services, it is limited to mass-media production and placement. Advertising expense also includes costs for all marketing activities including paid search, advertising on social networking sites, affiliate programs, direct response television, radio air time and direct mail.
•Direct Operations-includes expenses associated with the direct operations and technology infrastructure related to loan underwriting, collections and processing, and bank service charges and credit scoring charges.
•Depreciation and amortization-includes all store and corporate depreciation and amortization expense.
•Other operating expense-includes expenses such as office expense, security expense, travel and entertainment expenses, certain taxes, legal and professional fees, foreign currency impact to our intercompany balances, gains or losses on foreign currency exchanges, disposals of fixed assets, certain store closure costs, and other miscellaneous income and expense amounts.
Other Expense
Our non-operating expenses include the following:
•Interest Expense-includes interest primarily related to our Senior Secured Notes, our SPV and SPE facilities, and our Senior Revolver.
•Income or loss from equity method investment and Gain from equity method investment - includes our share of Katapult's income or loss and a recognized gain from the merger of Katapult and FinServ. Refer to Item 1, "Business-Company History and Overview" and Note 6, "Fair Value Measurements" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on our equity method investment.
•Loss on extinguishment of debt - includes costs associated with the extinguishment of debt facilities.
Revenue by Product and Segment and Related Loan Portfolio Performance
Consolidated Revenue by Product and Segment
The following table summarizes revenue by product, including CSO fees, for the period indicated:
For the year ended December 31, 2021, total revenue declined $29.6 million, or 3.5%, to $817.8 million, compared to the prior year. Excluding Runoff Portfolios, total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $33.7 million, or 4.6%, compared to the prior year. Geographically, U.S. revenues declined 17.6% year over year (9.5% excluding Runoff Portfolios) largely due to COVID-19 Impacts, while Canada Direct Lending revenues increased 23.1% due to the continued popularity and growth of Revolving LOC loans. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Canada POS Lending revenue was $34.8 million, inclusive of acquisition-related adjustments which reduced total revenue by $7.5 million.
Canada POS Lending revenue includes MDR, which is recognized over the life of the underlying loan term. On March 10, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Flexiti. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Canada POS Lending results were impacted by adjustments related to that acquisition that reduced revenue by $7.5 million and net revenue by $13.9 million ("acquisition-related adjustments"). The acquisition included a loan portfolio with a fair value of approximately $196.1 million ("Acquired Portfolio"). A fair value discount of $12.5 million was based on estimated future net cash flows and is recognized in net revenue over the expected life of the Acquired Portfolio (approximately 12 months). This amortization resulted in an increase in revenue of $6.6 million and loan loss provision of $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Acquired Portfolio also included $14.1 million of unearned MDR and annual and administrative fees, which are not amortized to revenue for the Acquired Portfolio because they do not represent future cash flows. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Canada POS Lending revenue and net revenue were both lower by $14.1 million compared to what would have been reported if the unearned MDR and fees had been recognized over the expected life of the Acquired Portfolio. The acquisition-related adjustments related to the unearned MDR annual and administrative fees will decline each quarter, until becoming fully amortized by the end of the first quarter of 2022.
The table below presents acquisition-related adjustments to Flexiti's revenue and net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021:
From a product perspective, Revolving LOC revenues increased $45.1 million, or 18.1%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to growth in Canada Direct Lending revenue of $40.9 million, or 35.6%, and Canada POS Lending of $32.3 million, partially offset by declines in U.S. revenue of $28.1 million, or 20.9%. Excluding Runoff Portfolios, U.S. Revolving LOC revenue decreased $1.6 million, or 1.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, Installment revenues decreased $89.5 million, or 16.6%, compared to the prior year. Excluding Runoff Portfolios, Installment revenue decreased $52.9 million, or 11.6%, primarily as a result of COVID-19 related constraints on demand and the continued shift to Revolving LOC loans.
Ancillary revenues increased $14.9 million, or 25.2%, versus the prior year from the sale of insurance products to Revolving LOC and Installment loan customers in Canada.
The following table summarizes revenue by product, including CSO fees, for 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
For a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Revenue by Product and Segment and Related Loan Portfolio Performance" in Part II Item 7 of our 2020 Form 10-K.
The following table presents online revenue and online transaction compositions, including CSO fees, of the products and services that we currently offer within the U.S., excluding Heights, and Canada Direct Lending segments:
For the year ended December 31, 2021, online revenue as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased as a result of our store closures during the second and third quarters of 2021, as well as the continued transition of customers to our online channel.
Loan Volume and Portfolio Performance Analysis
The following table reconciles Company Owned gross loans receivable, a GAAP-basis balance sheet measure, to Gross combined loans receivable, a non-GAAP measure(1). Gross combined loans receivables includes loans originated by third-party lenders through CSO programs, which are not included in our Consolidated Financial Statements but from which we earn revenue by providing a guarantee to the unaffiliated lender (in thousands):
Gross combined loans receivable by product at quarter-end are presented below.
Gross combined loans receivable increased $996.8 million, or 166.7%, to $1,594.6 million as of December 31, 2021, from $597.8 million as of December 31, 2020. Gross combined loans receivables as of December 31, 2021 included $196.1 million and approximately $472 million of receivables acquired on the date of acquisition of Flexiti and Heights, respectively. Canada POS Lending has continued to grow rapidly throughout the year, particularly beginning in July 2021 with Flexiti beginning its exclusive POS financing partnership with LFL. In addition, the holiday season drove $114.4 million of Canada POS Lending loan growth in November and December 2021. Excluding loans acquired in connection with the Flexiti acquisition on March 10, 2021 and the Heights acquisition on December 27, 2021, gross combined loans receivables increased $329.0 million, or 41.4%, from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, primarily driven by Canada Direct Lending growth of $96.9 million, or 29.3%. During such period, U.S. gross combined loans receivable, excluding Heights, decreased $30.9 million, or 11.6%, primarily due to (i) COVID-19 Impacts and (ii) the aforementioned Runoff Portfolios. Excluding Runoff Portfolios and gross loans receivables acquired with Heights, U.S. gross combined loans receivable grew $24.3 million, or 12.6%, during such period.
Sequentially, gross combined loans receivable increased $668.9 million, or 72.2%. Geographically, U.S. grew sequentially by $475.7 million, or 204.5%, as a result of our acquisition of Heights, which accounted for approximately $472 million of loans receivable as of December 31, 2021. Canada grew sequentially by $193.2 million, or 27.9%, primarily driven by Canada POS Lending growth of $156.8 million, or 51.9%, and Canada Direct Lending Revolving LOC growth of $35.9 million, or 9.8%. Excluding Heights, gross combined loans receivable increased $197.2 million, or 21.3%, sequentially, as consumer demand increased in the fourth quarter.
Consolidated Results of Operations
Beginning in the year ended December 31, 2021, we changed our presentation of operating expenses on our Statements of Operations. The December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 presentations have been revised to conform to the current year presentation. Refer to the comparison of "Comparison of Consolidated Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020" below for a description of expenses included within each operating expense line item.
The table below presents our consolidated results of operations. A further discussion of the results of our operating segments is provided under "-Segment Analysis" below.
(in thousands)
Comparison of Consolidated Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Revenue and Net Revenue
For a discussion of revenue, see "Consolidated Revenue by Product and Segment" above.
Provision for losses decreased by $43.1 million, or 14.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. The decrease in provision for losses was primarily a result of lower average loan balances in the U.S. and multiple rounds of U.S. government stimulus associated with COVID-19, partially offset by provisioning on Canada Direct Lending growth and upfront loss provisioning on rapid customer receivables growth late in the quarter in Canada POS Lending. Refer to "Loan Volume and Portfolio Performance Analysis" and "Segment Analysis" sections below for additional details.
Operating Expenses
Salaries and benefits were $237.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $40.3 million, or 20.5%, compared to the prior year. Excluding costs associated with Canada POS Lending, salaries and benefits increased $25.8 million, or 13.1%, primarily due to timing and level of performance-based variable compensation and personnel investments to support Canada Direct Lending growth.
Occupancy costs were $55.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $1.7 million, or 3.0%, compared to the prior year. Excluding costs associated with Canada POS Lending, occupancy costs decreased $2.2 million, or 3.9%, primarily due to store closures in the U.S. during the second and third quarters of 2021.
Advertising costs decreased $5.8 million, or 13.0%, year over year, and $7.1 million, or 15.9%, excluding Canada POS Lending. The prior-year period included costs for Verge Installment loans which have since been suspended, as described further in "Segment Analysis" below.
Direct operations were $60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $13.2 million, or 28.1%, compared to the prior year. Excluding costs associated with Canada POS Lending, direct operations decreased $1.2 million, or 2.6%, primarily driven by lower collection fees paid in the U.S. due to lower year over year demand and multiple rounds of significant U.S. government stimulus associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased $9.5 million, or 54.0%, year over year. Excluding costs associated with Canada POS Lending, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $1.0 million, or 5.6%, primarily driven by our store closures in the U.S. during the second and third quarters of 2021.
Other operating expenses were $74.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $27.6 million, or 58.7%, compared to the prior year. Excluding costs associated with Canada POS Lending, other operating expenses increased $17.8 million, or 37.9%, primarily due to (i) $13.7 million of transaction costs related to our acquisition of Flexiti in March 2021, our acquisition of Heights in December 2021, and the Katapult and FinServ merger in June 2021, and (ii) $8.8 million of certain restructuring costs related to our second and third quarter 2021 store closures in the U.S.
Other Expense
Interest Expense
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $24.6 million, or 33.9%, primarily related to (i) interest on debt acquired as part of the acquisition of Flexiti, (ii) higher year-over-year interest on our U.S. SPV, and (iii) interest expense associated with the additional issuance of our 7.50% Senior Secured Notes. An additional $2.1 million of interest was incurred for the year ended December 31, 2021, which represents interest on the 8.25% Senior Secured Notes for the period between July 30, 2021 and August 12, 2021. This is the period during which both the 8.25% Senior Secured Notes and 7.50% Senior Secured Notes were outstanding.
Equity Method Investment
We recognize our share of Katapult’s earnings or loss on a one-quarter lag. Our share of Katapult's earnings was $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which included a gain from revaluing Katapult's public and private warrant liability. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we purchased an additional 2.6 million of Katapult's common stock for $10.0 million, which increased our ownership in Katapult from 19.3% to 25.2% on a fully diluted basis assuming full pay-out of the earn-out shares as of December 31, 2021.
On June 9, 2021, Katapult completed its merger with FinServ. As part of the merger, we received cash consideration of $146.9 million and retained ownership through shares after the merger. As of December 31, 2021, our total cash investment in Katapult is $37.6 million.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt
Loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $40.2 million was due to the redemption of the 8.25% Senior Secured Notes.
Provision for Income Taxes
The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 26.3%, consistent with the blended federal and state/provincial statutory rate of approximately 26%. The income tax expense includes nondeductible expense items related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration of $1.6 million, and nondeductible transaction costs of $1.2 million, partially offset by proportionally more net income in lower-tax rate jurisdictions, driven by the gain on the Katapult transaction of $146.9 million in the second quarter of 2021 and the loss on extinguishment of debt of $40.2 million in the third quarter of 2021.
Additionally, income tax expense includes the release of a valuation allowance of $0.4 million due to our share of Katapult's income, tax benefits related to share-based compensation of $0.8 million, $0.2 million tax expense of additional Texas accrual for 2020 due to the settlement of 2013 to 2019 Texas returns, and a tax benefit of $0.9 million for the recognition of research and development tax credit.
The effective income tax rate of adjusted tax expense included in Adjusted Net Income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 23.5%.
Comparison of Consolidated Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
For a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Consolidated Results of Operations" in Part II Item 7 of our 2020 Form 10-K.
Segment Analysis
The following is a summary of portfolio performance and results of operations for the segment and period indicated (all periods unaudited except for Q4 2021 and Q4 2020). We report financial results for three reportable segments: US, Canada Direct Lending and Canada POS Lending.
U.S. Portfolio Performance
On December 27, 2021, we acquired Heights which accounted for approximately $472 million of U.S. Installment loans as of December 31, 2021. As the period between December 27, 2021 and December 31, 2021 did not result in material loan performance, we have excluded Heights from the table and related discussion below for the fourth quarter and year ended 2021.
U.S. Net Revenue
U.S. revenues, excluding Heights, decreased by $11.3 million, or 7.7%, for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to $135.3 million, compared to the prior-year period, primarily as a result of the COVID-19 Impacts on gross combined loans receivable and Runoff Portfolios due to regulatory changes. See the loan performance discussions below for further details. Excluding Runoff Portfolios, U.S. revenues increased $6.6 million, or 5.4%.
The provision for losses for the three months ended December 31, 2021 decreased $2.2 million, or 3.8%, year over year, primarily as a result of sustained favorable NCO rates and stable past-due rates since the onset of COVID-19. U.S. past-due rates, including for loans Guaranteed by the Company, increased by 90 bps, or 4.5%, year over year, but improved 75 bps, or 3.4%, sequentially. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, the U.S. NCO rate increased 340 bps, or 16.4%, year over year, and increased 280 bps, or 12.9%, sequentially, primarily due to loan growth, and a mix shift in customer and origination channel.
U.S. Revolving LOC loan performance
U.S. Revolving LOC loan balances as of December 31, 2021 decreased $3.0 million, or 5.5%, compared to the prior year, resulting in a related revenue decrease of $3.2 million, or 10.3%, for the three months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the runoff of Virginia Revolving LOC loans. Excluding the Runoff Portfolios, U.S. Revolving LOC gross loans receivable increased $3.8 million, or 8.2%, year over year, and related revenue increased $2.0 million, or 8.1%. Sequentially, U.S. Revolving LOC loan balances increased $1.3 million, or 2.6%. The Revolving LOC allowance coverage decreased year over year from 34.5% to 25.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was due to stable past-due rates, a decline in TDR loans as a percentage of total gross loans receivable and sustained favorable NCO trends during 2021. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, NCO rates improved from 22.3% to 22.1% year over year and past-due rates improved from 30.7% to 30.5%.
U.S. Installment loan performance - Company Owned
U.S. Installment loan balances as of December 31, 2021 decreased $30.1 million, or 17.9%, year over year and revenue decreased $12.1 million, or 17.6%, for the three months ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year, primarily due to COVID-19 Impacts and Runoff Portfolios. Excluding the Runoff Portfolios, U.S. Installment loans increased $18.3 million, or 17.9%, year over year, and related revenue increased $0.5 million, or 1.1%. The Installment loans allowance coverage decreased from 19.0% in the prior year to 12.7% as of December 31, 2021, largely due to the aforementioned Runoff Portfolios, stable past-due rates and sustained favorable NCO rates. Sequentially, allowance coverage decreased from 13.4% to 12.7% as a result of lower past-due loans and stable NCOs.
We launched Verge Installment loans originated by Stride Bank in the fourth quarter of 2019 and executed pilot programs in several states. After testing various offers, rates, terms and approval criteria, Stride informed us in the first quarter of 2021 that it planned to focus on near-prime loans as they represented a larger addressable market and offered greater opportunity to scale. As a result, Stride discontinued new Verge Credit loans in April 2021. Verge loan balances totaled $6.2 million as of December 31, 2021. We expect to continue to see an orderly runoff of these balances over approximately the next 15 months.
U.S. Installment loan performance - Guaranteed by the Company
U.S. Installment loans Guaranteed by the Company increased $2.2 million, or 5.0%, year over year and increased $2.9 million, or 6.7%, sequentially. The CSO liability for losses rate decreased from 16.4% to 14.9% year over year due to sustained favorable NCO rates since the onset of COVID-19. Sequentially, the CSO liability for losses coverage decreased from 16.1% to 14.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 as a result of lower past-due rates. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, the past-due rate improved sequentially from 19.8% to 17.7%. The NCO rate for U.S. Installment loans Guaranteed by the Company increased 660 bps, or 12.8%, year over year, and increased 490 bps, or 9.3%, sequentially, primarily due to loan growth, and new customer, channel mix and seasonality.
Following is a summary of results of operations for the U.S. segment for the periods indicated.
Comparison of U.S. Segment Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
U.S. revenues decreased $112.6 million, or 17.6%, compared to the prior-year period for the year ended December 31, 2021, as a result of decreases in combined gross loans receivable from COVID-19 Impacts and the Runoff Portfolios. Excluding the impact of Runoff Portfolios, U.S. revenues decreased $49.3 million, or 9.5%, as a result of lower consumer demand, driven by COVID-19 Impacts.
The provision for losses decreased $64.1 million, or 27.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior-year period, primarily as a result of (i) lower year-over-year demand, excluding Heights, (ii), sustained favorable lower NCO rates since the onset of COVID-19 and (iii) continued improved credit quality.
Operating expenses were $338.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $23.4 million, or 7.4%, compared to $315.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by (i) $13.7 million of transaction costs related to our acquisition of Flexiti in March 2021, our acquisition of Heights in December 2021, and the Katapult and FinServ merger in June 2021, (ii) $12.7 million of store closure costs as previously discussed, and (iii) $0.7 million of higher share-based compensation expense compared to the prior year. Excluding these costs, operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased $2.8 million, or 0.9%, compared to the prior year.
U.S. interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $9.1 million, or 14.4%, primarily related to interest on the additional 7.50% Senior Secured Notes issued in conjunction with our Heights acquisition and $5.0 million of interest on our U.S. SPV compared to prior year as the facility was entered into in April 2020. An additional $2.1 million of interest was incurred for the year ended December 31, 2021, which represents interest on the 8.25% Senior Secured Notes for the period between July 30, 2021 and August 12, 2021. This is the period during which both the 8.25% Senior Secured Notes and 7.50% Senior Secured Notes were outstanding.
As previously described, we recognize our share of Katapult’s income or loss on a one-quarter lag and recorded income of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. As a result of the merger between Katapult and FinServ, which closed during the second quarter of 2021, we recorded an additional gain of $135.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, which represents cash we received, net of the basis of our investment in Katapult. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we purchased an additional 2.6 million of Katapult's common stock for $10.0 million, which increased our ownership in Katapult from 19.3% to 25.2% on a fully diluted basis assuming full pay-out of earn-out shares as of December 31, 2021.
Loss on extinguishment of debt of $40.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 was due to the redemption of the 8.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2025.
Comparison of U.S. Segment Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
For a comparison of our U.S. segment results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Segment Analysis" in Part II Item 7 of our 2020 Form 10-K.
Canada Direct Lending and Canada POS Lending Portfolio Performance
(in thousands, except percentages) Q4 2021 Q3 2021 Q2 2021 Q1 2021 Q4 2020
(7) The past-due rate for Canada POS Lending for loans 30+ days past-due were 1.9%, 2.1%, 2.6% and 3.0% for the three months ended December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021, June 30, 2021 and March 31, 2021, respectively.
Canada Direct Lending Net Revenue
Canada Direct Lending revenue increased year over year by $15.0 million, or 27.1%, ($12.7 million, or 23.0%, on a constant currency basis), for the three months ended December 31, 2021, due to the growth of Revolving LOC loans in Canada. Sequentially, Canada Direct Lending revenue increased $4.3 million, or 6.6%.
The provision for losses increased $12.5 million, or 116.4%, ($11.8 million, or 109.7%, on a constant currency basis), to $23.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, compared to $10.7 million in the prior-year period. The increase in provision for losses was primarily due to higher past-due rates, which increased from 6.4% to 8.5% year over year. NCO rates increased from 3.5% to 4.4% year over year and increased from 3.3% to 4.4% sequentially due to new customer, channel mix and seasonality. Although NCOs increased from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, NCO rates have remained stable since the onset of COVID-19, resulting in an allowance coverage decrease year over year of 250 bps, or 24.2%.
Canada Direct Lending Revolving LOC loan performance
Canada Direct Lending Revolving LOC gross loans receivable increased $99.1 million, or 32.7%, ($99.9 million, or 32.9%, on a constant currency basis) year over year and $35.9 million, or 9.8% ($36.1 million, or 9.9%, on a constant currency basis), sequentially. Revolving LOC revenue increased $12.0 million, or 37.5%, year over year and $3.7 million, or 9.2%, sequentially ($10.5 million, or 33.0%, and $3.7 million, or 9.3%, respectively, on a constant currency basis). The quarterly NCO rate increased by 80 bps, or 25.5%, year-over-year and 110 bps, or 40.0%, sequentially due to new customer, channel mix and seasonality. Although NCOs increased from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, NCO rates have remained stable since the onset of COVID-19, resulting in an allowance coverage decrease year over year from 10.8% to 8.0% as of December 31, 2021.
Canada Direct Lending Installment loan performance
Canada Direct Lending Installment revenue increased $0.3 million, or 2.8%, (a decrease of $0.1 million, or 0.6%, on a constant currency basis) year over year. Installment gross loans receivable decreased $2.2 million, or 8.0% ($2.1 million, or 7.8%, on a constant currency basis) year over year. The year-over-year decrease in Installment loans was due to a continued shift to Revolving LOC loans, as well as COVID-19 related constraints on demand, particularly as related to store-originated Installment loans. The Installment allowance coverage decreased year over year from 8.3% to 8.0% primarily as a result of lower sustained NCOs since the onset of COVID-19 and stable past-due rates. The year-over-year past-due rate for Installment loans improved by 15 bps, or 8.1%. Sequentially, Installment gross loans receivable and related revenue remained consistent.
Canada POS Lending Revolving LOC loan performance
Canada POS Lending Revolving LOC gross loans receivable as of December 31, 2021 was $459.2 million, including a discount of $2.3 million related to purchase accounting adjustments ($461.5 million prior to purchase accounting adjustments). For the three months ended December 31, 2021, Canada POS Lending revenue was $14.8 million, net of a $1.7 million reduction from acquisition-related adjustments for the period. For a full discussion of the purchase accounting and acquisition-related adjustments, refer to "Consolidated Revenue by Product and Segment" above.
For the three months ended December 31, 2021, allowance coverage was 4.8%, up sequentially from 3.8%. Excluding acquisition-related adjustments, allowance coverage was 5.3%, down sequentially from 5.5%, primarily due to sustained favorable NCO trends. Revolving LOC gross loans receivable generally charge-off at 180 days past due. NCOs were $1.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The Canada POS Lending NCO and past-due rates for the quarter were 0.5% and 4.1%, respectively, down sequentially from 0.7% and 4.8%, respectively.
Originations for the three months ended December 31, 2021 were C$322.1 million, an increase of C$200.8 million, or 165.6%, from the prior-year period of C$121.3 million. Sequentially, Canada POS Revolving LOC gross loans receivable increased $156.8 million, or 51.9%.
Canada Direct Lending Results of Operations
Comparison of Canada Direct Lending Segment Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Canada Direct Lending revenue increased $48.2 million, or 23.1%, ($31.6 million, or 15.1%, on a constant currency basis), to $257.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $208.9 million in the prior year, primarily due to higher consumer demand as COVID-19 Impacts lessened. Canada Direct Lending Revolving LOC gross loans receivable grew $99.1 million, or 32.7%, year over year, contributing to related revenue growth of $40.9 million, or 35.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year.
The provision for losses decreased $3.7 million, or 6.2%, ($7.0 million, or 12.0% on a constant currency basis), to $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $58.6 million in the prior year. The decrease in provision for losses was the result of sustained lower NCOs since the onset of COVID-19 and the related impact of changes in allowance coverage due to an increase in credit quality for Revolving LOC loans. Refer to "Canada Direct Lending and Canada POS Lending Portfolio Performance" above for additional details on quarterly loss and allowance rates.
Canada Direct Lending operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $103.5 million, an increase of $8.8 million, or 9.2%, ($2.1 million, or 2.2%, on a constant currency basis), compared to $94.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily related to (i) the timing and level of performance-based variable compensation, (ii) higher store operating costs as the prior year was impacted by COVID-19 store closures, and (iii) higher variable costs, primarily collection and financial service fees, on higher volume year over year.
Canada Direct Lending other expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $9.8 million, an increase of $0.5 million, or 5.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher borrowings on the Canada SPV. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we increased the capacity of the Canada SPV from C$175.0 million to C$350.0 million.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to the financial information prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, we provide certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” including:
•Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share (net income from continuing operations plus or minus certain legal and other costs, income or loss from equity method investment, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, transaction-related costs, restructuring costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, adjustments related to acquisition accounting, certain costs related to the disposition of U.K., share-based compensation, intangible asset amortization, certain tax adjustments and impacts from tax law changes and cumulative tax effect of applicable adjustments, on a total and per share basis);
•EBITDA (net income from continuing operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization);
•Adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA plus or minus certain non-cash and other adjusting items);
•Adjusted effective income tax rate (effective tax rate plus or minus certain non-cash and other adjusting items); and
•Gross Combined Loans Receivable (includes loans originated by third-party lenders through CSO programs which are not included in our Consolidated Financial Statements).
We believe that presentation of non-GAAP financial information is meaningful and useful in understanding the activities and business metrics of our operations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures offer another way to view aspects of our business that, when viewed with our U.S. GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business.
We believe that investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, to assess operating performance and that such measures may highlight trends in the business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying on financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, we believe that the adjustments shown below are useful to investors in order to allow them to compare our financial results during the periods shown without the effect of each of these income or expense items. In addition, we believe that Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of public companies in our industry, many of which present Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share, EBITDA and/or Adjusted EBITDA when reporting their results.
We provide non-GAAP financial information for informational purposes and to enhance understanding of the U.S. GAAP Consolidated Financial Statements. Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Gross Combined Loans Receivable should not be considered as alternatives to income from continuing operations, segment operating income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or any other liquidity measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Readers should consider the information in addition to, but not instead of or superior to, the financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this 2021 Form 10-K may be determined or calculated differently by other companies, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.
Description and Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our income or cash flows as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:
•they do not include cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
•they do not include changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs;
•they do not include the interest expense, or the cash requirements, necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt;
•depreciation and amortization are non-cash expense items reported in the statements of cash flows; and
•other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
We calculate Adjusted Earnings per Share utilizing diluted shares outstanding at year-end. If we record a loss from continuing operations under U.S. GAAP, shares outstanding utilized to calculate Diluted Earnings per Share from continuing operations are equivalent to basic shares outstanding. Shares outstanding utilized to calculate Adjusted Earnings per Share from continuing operations reflect the number of diluted shares we would have reported if reporting net income from continuing operations under U.S. GAAP.
Gross Combined Loans Receivable includes loans originated by third-party lenders through CSO programs which are not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements but from which we earn revenue and for which we provide a guarantee to the lender. Management believes this analysis provides investors with important information needed to evaluate overall lending performance.

Currency Information
We operate in the U.S. and Canada and our consolidated results are reported in U.S. dollars.
Changes in our reported revenues and net income include the effect of changes in currency exchange rates. We translate all balance sheet accounts into U.S. dollars at the currency exchange rate in effect at the end of each period. We translate the statement of operations at the average rates of exchange for the period. We record currency translation adjustments as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Stockholders’ Equity.
Constant Currency Analysis
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, approximately 35.7% and 24.6%, respectively, of our revenues were originated in Canadian Dollars. As a result, changes in our reported results include the impacts of changes in the foreign currency exchange rates for the Canadian Dollar.
Income Statement
Balance Sheet - Exchange Rate as of December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following constant currency analysis removes the impact of the fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and utilizes constant currency results in our analysis of the Canada Direct Lending segment performance. The fluctuation in foreign exchange rates between March 10, 2021, the date we acquired Flexiti, and December 31, 2021 was minimal and thus the constant currency impact on our Canada POS Lending segment was not material. Our constant currency assessment assumes foreign exchange rates in the current fiscal periods remained the same as in the prior fiscal periods. All conversion rates below are based on the U.S. Dollar equivalent to the Canadian Dollar. We believe that the constant currency assessment below is a useful measure in assessing the comparable growth and profitability of our operations.
For our Canada Direct Lending segment, we calculated the revenues, net revenue and segment operating income below for the year ended December 31, 2021 using the actual average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 (in thousands).
We calculated the revenues and gross margin below for the year ended December 31, 2020 using the actual average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 (in thousands).
We calculated gross loans receivable below as of December 31, 2021 using the actual exchange rate as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands).
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal sources of liquidity to fund the loans we make to our customers are (i) cash provided by operations, (ii) our revolving credit facilities and our non-recourse funding facilities, as further described in Note 7, "Debt" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and (iii) funds from third-party lenders under our CSO programs. In July 2021, we issued $750.0 million of 7.50% Senior Secured Notes, due 2028. The net proceeds from the sale of the 7.50% Senior Secured Notes were used (i) to redeem our outstanding 8.25% Senior Secured Notes, (ii) to pay fees, expenses, premiums and accrued interest in connection therewith and (iii) for general corporate purposes. In connection with our acquisition of Heights, we issued an additional $250.0 million of our 7.50% Senior Secured Notes. Refer to Note 7, "Debt" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.
As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all financial ratios, covenants and other requirements in our debt agreements. We anticipate that our primary use of cash will be to fund growth in our working capital, finance capital expenditures to further our growth strategy in both the U.S. and Canada and meet our debt obligations. We may also use cash for potential strategic investments in and acquisitions of other companies that help us extend our reach and product portfolio. Additionally, we may use cash to fund a return on capital for our stockholders through share repurchase programs, or in the form of dividends. In May 2021, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend to $0.11 per share, an increase of 100%, which continued into 2022. Additionally, in May 2021 our Board of Directors authorized a $50.0 million share repurchase program which concluded in February 2022. A new $25.0 million share repurchase program was authorized in February 2022, which will commence at our discretion. Refer to Note 23, "Share Repurchase Program" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of the program.
Our level of cash flow provided by operating activities typically experiences seasonal fluctuations related to our levels of net income and changes in working capital levels, particularly loans receivable. Unexpected changes in our financial condition or other unforeseen factors may result in our inability to obtain third-party financing or could increase our borrowing costs in the future. We have the ability to adjust our volume of lending to consumers to the extent we experience any short-term or long-term funding shortfalls, such as tightening our credit approval practices (as we did during the COVID-19 pandemic), which has the effect of reducing cash outflow requirements while increasing cash inflows through loan repayments.
We may also sell or securitize our assets, draw on our available revolving credit facility or line of credit, enter into additional refinancing agreements or reduce our capital spending to generate additional liquidity. The impacts to cash as described in "-Cash Flows" below and other factors resulted in our available cash on hand of $63.2 million and our total liquidity of $214.1 million as of December 31, 2021. We believe our cash on hand and available borrowings provide us with sufficient liquidity for at least the next 12 months.
Our recent acquisitions of Flexiti and Heights have increased our product offerings to include customers in the near-prime and prime space. The acquisition of Flexiti allows us to tailor our current product structure to its POS model, potentially expanding to sub-prime customers. The acquisition of Heights accelerates our strategic transition in the U.S. toward longer term, higher balance and lower rate credit products and provides us with access to a larger addressable market while mitigating regulatory risk. These initiatives to expand our product offerings and grow the U.S. and Canada business can materially impact our future cash flows. For further information regarding the acquisitions, refer to Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Nature of Operations," Note 5, "Goodwill and Intangibles," and Note 15, "Acquisitions" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We have no additional material commitments or demands that are likely to affect our liquidity.

During the third quarter of 2021, we extinguished our $690.0 million 8.25% Senior Secured Notes from the issuance of our 7.50% Senior Secured Notes of $750.0 million. As part of the refinancing, we paid a $31.3 million call premium and debt issuance costs of $16.0 million. In connection with the acquisition of Heights, we issued an additional $250.0 million of 7.50% Senior Secured Notes and paid additional debt issuance costs of $4.5 million. In addition, net cash provided by financing activities included $304.9 million of net proceeds from our funding facilities primarily due to the new Flexiti Securitization facility, entered into during the fourth quarter of 2021 for C$526.5 million, partially offset by common stock repurchases of $45.4 million and cash dividends of $15.9 million. See Note 7, "Debt" of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our funding facilities and corporate debt.
Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
For a comparison of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Cash Flows" in Part II Item 7 of our 2020 Form 10-K.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Nature of Operations" of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We consider the following accounting policies to be critical in understanding our historical and future performance and require management's most subjective and complex judgments.
Allowance for Loan Losses
Credit losses are an inherent part of outstanding loans receivable. We maintain an allowance for loan losses for loans and interest receivable at a level we estimate to be adequate to absorb incurred losses based primarily on our analysis of historical loss or charge-off rates by products containing similar risk characteristics. The allowance for loan losses on our Company Owned gross loans receivables reduces the outstanding gross loans receivables balance in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We report the liability for losses related to loans Guaranteed by the Company under CSO programs in “Liability for losses on CSO lender-owned consumer loans” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We record increases in either the allowance or the liability, net of charge-offs and recoveries, as “Provision for losses” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
We also consider delinquency trends as well as macro-economic conditions we believe may affect portfolio losses. If a loan is deemed to be uncollectible before it is fully reserved based on information we become aware of (e.g., receipt of customer bankruptcy notice or death), we charge off such loan at that time. Qualitative factors such as the impact of new loan products, changes to underwriting criteria or lending policies, new store development or entrance into new markets, changes in jurisdictional regulations or laws, recent credit trends and general economic conditions impact management’s judgment on the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Any recoveries on loans previously charged to the allowance are credited to the allowance when collected.
Business Combinations and Contingent Consideration
We include the results of operations of acquired businesses from the date of acquisition. We determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition. The excess purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue and cash flows, discount rates, and
selection of comparable companies. Our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.
During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill. After the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. When we grant equity to employees of the selling stockholders in connection with an acquisition, we evaluate whether the awards are compensatory. This evaluation includes whether stock award vesting is contingent on the continued employment beyond the acquisition date. If continued employment is required for stock awards to vest, the award is treated as compensation for post-acquisition services and is recognized as compensation expense.
Transaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred and are included in Corporate, district and other expenses in our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
On March 10, 2021, we acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Flexiti. The fair value of total consideration paid as part of the acquisition was comprised of $86.5 million in cash, $6.3 million in debt costs and $20.6 million in contingent cash consideration subject to future operating metrics, including revenue less NCOs and loan originations. Net assets acquired were $68.5 million, resulting in goodwill of $44.9 million. During the second quarter of 2021, we recorded $5.0 million of additional net assets acquired as of the acquisition date, as a measurement period adjustment, resulting in a $5.0 million decrease in goodwill. During the third quarter of 2021, we recorded a $0.5 million decrease to net assets acquired as of the acquisition date, as a measurement period adjustment, resulting in a $0.5 million increase in goodwill. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration is recognized each reporting period and included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a $6.2 million expense related to the increase in fair value of contingent consideration.
On December 27, 2021, we acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Heights. The fair value of total consideration paid as part of the acquisition was comprised of $335.0 million in cash and $25.0 million of the Company's common stock. Net assets acquired, after giving effect of initial purchase price fair value adjustments, were $562.6 million, resulting in goodwill of $253.9 million.
Goodwill
We exercise judgment in evaluating assets for impairment. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or when circumstances arise which could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These tests require comparing carrying values to estimated fair values of the reporting unit under review.
Following the acquisition of Flexiti during the first quarter of 2021, our reporting units consist of the U.S. (inclusive of Heights, acquired on December 27, 2021), Canada Direct Lending and Canada POS Lending segments, as defined by FASB’s ASC 280, Segment Reporting, for which we assess goodwill for impairment. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed a quantitative assessment for the U.S., Canada Direct Lending and Canada POS Lending reporting units as of October 1, 2021. As further described in Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Nature of Operations, an impairment would occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit. Events or circumstances that could indicate an impairment include a significant change in the business climate, a change in strategic direction, legal factors, operating performance indicators, a change in the competitive environment, the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit or economic outlook. Fair value of each reporting unit is sensitive to changes in macroeconomic factors in the U.S. and Canada, including as a result of COVID-19, which could impact all reporting units. Changes in the expected length of the current economic downturn, timing of recovery, or long-term revenue growth or profitability for these reporting units could increase the likelihood of a future goodwill impairment. Additionally, changes in market participant assumptions such as an increased discount rate or further share price reductions could increase the likelihood of a future impairment. These and other macroeconomic factors were considered when performing the annual test as of October 1, 2021.
Based upon the qualitative assessment as of October 1, 2021, management concluded that the reporting units' estimated fair values exceeded their carrying value. As a result, we did not record impairment losses on goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2021.
The following table summarizes the segment allocation of recorded goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the periods indicated:
Credit Services Organization
Through our CSO programs, we act as a CSO/CAB on behalf of customers in accordance with applicable state laws. We currently offer loans through CSO programs in stores and online in the state of Texas. See Item 1. “Business-Regulatory Environment and Compliance” for additional details.
As described above in "-Allowance for Loan Losses," we estimate a liability for losses associated with the guaranty provided to the CSO lenders using assumptions and methodologies similar to the allowance for loan losses, which we recognize for our consumer loans. The liability for losses on CSO lender-owned consumer loans was $6.9 million at December 31, 2021 and $7.2 million at December 31, 2020, which we include as "Liability for losses on CSO lender-owned consumer loans" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
We calculate CSO fees based on the amount of the customer’s outstanding loan and in accordance with the applicable jurisdiction’s laws. For services we provide under our CSO programs, we receive payments from customers on their scheduled loan repayment due dates. The CSO fee is earned ratably over the term of the loan as the customers make payments. If a loan is paid off early, no additional CSO fees are due or collected. The maximum CSO loan term is 180 days in Texas. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, approximately 58.3% and 66.5%, respectively, of loans originated under CSO programs were paid off prior to the original maturity date.
Since CSO loans are made by a third-party lender, we do not include them in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as loans receivable; instead, we include them in “Prepaid expense and other” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We receive payments from customers for these fees on their scheduled loan repayment due dates.
