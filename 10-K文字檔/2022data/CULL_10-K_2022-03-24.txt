ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The objective of this section is to help readers understand our views on our results of operations and financial condition. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview	
Total assets increased $23.3 million, or 7.0%, to $354.7 million at December 31, 2021 from $331.3 million at December 31, 2020. The increase was due to an increase in loans funded by an increase in deposits and equity from the capital raised in the conversion. During the year, we have been holding more longer-term, fixed-rate loans in our portfolio than during 2020. Total deposits increased $15.1 million, or 6.9%, to $232.0 million at December 31, 2021 from $217.0 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in deposits was due to the increase in the regular savings and other deposits categories, as we have grown accounts and customers have continued to reduce spending.
Net income decreased $1.8 million, or 50.7%, to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was due primarily to the one-time pre-tax $1.6 million expense for the contribution of common stock and cash to the Foundation in the third quarter of 2021. The additional decrease was due to increases in non-interest expense and a decrease in interest income, partially offset by decreases in interest expense and income tax expense. Interest income decreased $802,000, or 5.7%, to $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in interest income on loans (excluding PPP loans), which is our primary source of interest income. Interest expense decreased $1.1 million, or 37.7%, to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, due to a decrease of $586,000 in interest expense on deposits and a decrease of $495,000 in interest expense on borrowings.
We recorded provisions for loan losses of $60,000 and $152,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our allowance for loan losses was $2.4 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.94% at December 31, 2021 compared to 1.01% at December 31, 2020, while the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans was 810.10% at December 31, 2021 compared to 1,935.25% at December 31, 2020. We had charge-offs of $20,000 and recoveries of $15,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak	
To address the economic impact in the United States, the CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act included a number of provisions that affected us, including accounting relief for TDRs. The CARES Act also established the PPP through the SBA, which allowed us to lend money to small businesses to maintain employee payrolls through the crisis with guarantees from the SBA. Under this program, loan amounts may be forgiven if the borrower maintains employee payrolls and meets certain other requirements.
In addition, the Federal Reserve Board took steps to bolster the economy by, among other things, reducing the federal funds rate and the discount-window borrowing rate to near zero. In response to the pandemic, we implemented protocols and processes to help protect our employees, customers and communities. These measures included:
•Operating our branches under a drive-through model with appointment-only lobby service when needed.
•Offering assistance to our customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which includes payment deferrals, waiving certain fees, suspending property foreclosures, and participating in the CARES Act and lending programs for businesses, including the PPP.
We have implemented various consumer and commercial loan modification programs to provide our borrowers relief from the economic impacts of COVID-19. Based on guidance in the CARES Act, COVID-19 related modifications to loans that were current as of December 31, 2019 are exempt from TDR classification under U.S. GAAP. In addition, the bank regulatory agencies issued interagency guidance stating that COVID-19 related short-term modifications (i.e., six months or less) granted to loans that were current as of the loan modification program implementation date are not TDRs.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we granted short-term payment deferrals on 61 loans, totaling approximately $17.7 million in aggregate principal amount. As of December 31, 2021, all of these loans, have returned to normal payment status.
Given the unprecedented uncertainty and rapidly evolving economic effects and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the future direct and indirect impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition are uncertain. Adverse effects on our business and results of operations could include: decreased demand for our products and services, protracted periods of lower interest rates, increased non-interest expenses, including operational losses, and increased credit losses due to deterioration in the financial condition of our consumer and commercial borrowers, including declining asset and collateral values, which may continue to increase our provision for credit losses and net charge-offs.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be significant accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations.
The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an “emerging growth company” we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We have determined to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
The following represent our significant accounting policies:
Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is a reserve for estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans determined to be impaired as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Actual credit losses, net of recoveries, are deducted from the allowance for loan losses. Loans are charged off when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for loan losses. A provision for loan losses, which is a charge against earnings, is recorded to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level that, in management’s judgment, is adequate to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio. Management’s evaluation process used to determine the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is subject to the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgment. The evaluation process involves gathering and interpreting many qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect probable credit losses. Because interpretation and analysis involves judgment, current economic or business conditions can change, and future events are inherently difficult to predict, the anticipated amount of estimated loan losses and therefore the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses could change significantly.
The allocation methodology applied by Cullman Savings Bank is designed to assess the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and includes allocations for specifically identified impaired loans and loss factor allocations for all remaining loans, with a component primarily based on historical loss rates and a component primarily based on other qualitative factors. The methodology includes evaluation and consideration of several factors, such as, but not limited to, management’s ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. While management uses the best information available to make its evaluation, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if there are significant changes in economic conditions or circumstances underlying the collectability of loans. Because each of the criteria used is subject to change, the allocation of the allowance for loan losses is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future loan losses in any particular loan category. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the loan portfolio. Management believes the allowance for loan losses was appropriate at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The allowance analysis is reviewed by the board of directors on a quarterly basis in compliance with regulatory requirements. In addition, various regulatory agencies periodically review the allowance for loan losses and, as a result of such reviews, we may have to adjust our allowance for loan losses.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board has delayed the effective date of the implementation of the Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, standard for Cullman Bancorp and Cullman Savings Bank until January 1, 2023. CECL will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for credit losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are incurred or probable, which will greatly increase the types of data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase our allowance for credit losses.
Income Taxes. The assessment of income tax assets and liabilities involves the use of estimates, assumptions, interpretation, and judgment concerning certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes. There can be no assurance that future events, such as court decisions or positions of federal and state taxing authorities, will not differ from management’s current assessment, the impact of which could be significant to the results of operations and reported earnings.
Cullman Bancorp will file consolidated federal and state income tax returns with Cullman Savings Bank. Amounts provided for income tax expense are based on income reported for financial statement purposes and do not necessarily represent amounts currently payable under tax laws. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax law rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income tax expense. Valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that a portion of the full amount of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies. We may also recognize a liability for unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions. Unrecognized tax benefits represent the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized and measured in the consolidated financial statements. Penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense.

Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2021 and 2020
Total assets increased $23.3 million, or 7.0%, to $354.7 million at December 31,2021 from $331.4 at December 31,2020. The increase was due to an increase in loans funded from an increase in deposits and and increase in equity from the stock conversion.
Cash and cash equivalents increased $1.6 million to $61.9 million at December 31, 2021 from $60.4 million at December 31, 2020. The increase was due to an increase in deposits from an increase in accounts and continued reduced spending by our customers.
Gross loans held for investment increased $20.3 million, or 8.7%, to $254.6 million at December 31, 2021 from $234.3 million at December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in one-to-four family residential real estate loan, which increased $12.9 million, or 11.3%, to $127.7 million at December 31, 2021 from $114.8 million at December 31, 2020. We have held more longer-term loans in our portfolio than 2020. Construction loans have increased $10.0 million, or 181.9% to $$15.8 million at December 31, 2021 from $5.5 million at December 31, 2020. This is a combination of commercial and mortgage construction.
Securities available-for-sale increased $2.4 million, or 12.9%, to $21.3 million at December 31, 2021 from $18.9 million at December 31, 2020. We purchased $3 million in U.S Government agencies during 2021 as well as replacing municipal securities that were called in order to diversify our portfolio.
Total deposits increased $15.1 million, or 6.9%, to $232.0 million at December 31, 2021 from $217.0 at December 31, 2020. The increase in deposits was due to the increase in the regular savings and other deposits categories, as we have grown accounts and customers have continued to reduced spending. Regular savings and other deposits increased $13.9 million, or 33.5%, to $55.3 million at December 31, 2021 from $41.4 million at December 31, 2020.
We had $18.5 million of borrowings at December 31, 2021, compared to $53.5 million of borrowings at December 31, 2020. We decreased our borrowings based on the high amount of liquidity the bank had during 2021. We regularly review or liquidity position based on alternative uses of available funds as well as market conditions.
Shareholders' equity increased by $42.8 million, or 75.4%, to $99.7 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $56.9 million at December 31, 2020. The increase was due primarily to the capital raised in the offering.
Average Balance Sheets
The following table sets forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the years indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments have been made, as the effects would be immaterial. All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts, and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense. Deferred loan fees totaled $46,000 and $170,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Loan balances exclude loans held for sale. The decrease in deferred loan fees is due to the PPP balance decrease allowing the fee income to be recognized. Stockholders’ equity (book value) per share at December 31, 2021 was $10.46. We had no intangible assets at December 31, 2021.
--------
(1)Net interest rate spread represents the difference between the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets and the weighted average rate of interest-bearing liabilities.
(2)Net interest-earning assets represent total interest-earning assets less total interest-bearing liabilities.
(3)Net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets.
Rate/Volume Analysis
The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the years indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume. There were no out-of-period items or adjustments required to be excluded from the table below.
Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
General. Net income decreased $1.8 million, or 50.7%, to $1.8 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $3.5 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the one-time pre-tax $1.6 million expense for the contribution of common stock and cash to the Foundation in the third quarter of 2021. Additionally, there was a decrease in interest income, offset by a decrease in interest expense, with the changes in interest income and interest expense primarily due to changes in the market interest rates.
Interest Income. Interest income decreased $802,000, or 5.7%, to $13.4 million at December 31, 2021 from $14.2 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in interest income on loans (excluding PPP loans), which is our primary source of interest income. Interest income on loans decreased $709,000, or 5.3%, to $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our average balance of loans increased $2.2 million, or 0.9% for the year ended December 31, 2021 The increase is due to the decision to no longer sell longer-term, fixed-rate loans. Our weighted average yield on loans (excluding PPP loans) decreased 36 basis points to 5.18% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 5.54% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was due to the current market interest rates. We recognized $378,000 of interest income on PPP loans during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $342,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $39,000 of additional interest and fee income on PPP loans to be recognized in future periods.
Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $1.1 million, or 37.7%, to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was due to a decrease of $586,000 in interest expense on deposits and a decrease of $495,000 in interest expense on borrowings in 2021.
The decrease in interest expense on deposits was due primarily to a decrease in interest expense on certificates of deposit, which decreased $558,000, or 37.9%, to $913,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We experienced decreases in both the average balance of and rates paid on certificates of deposit. We have allowed higher-rate certificates of deposit to run off during the current interest rate environment, and rates have decreased due to changes in market interest rates. Interest paid on other deposit types also decreased (particularly
interest-bearing demand deposits, which decreased $30,000, or 24%) due to a decrease in rates, despite an increase in the average balance.
Interest expense on borrowings decreased $495,000, or 42.3%, and was $676,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The average rate we paid on borrowings decreased 33 basis points to 1.75% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2.08% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The average balances decreased $17.8 million, or 31.6%, to $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $279,000, or 2.5%, to $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of our interest expense decreasing faster than our interest income. Our interest rate spread decreased 24 basis points to 3.30% for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 3.54% for the year ended December 31, 2020, while our net interest margin decreased 29 basis points to 3.46% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 3.75% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Provision for Loan Losses. Provision for loan losses are charged to operations to establish an allowance for loan losses at a level necessary to absorb known and inherent losses in our loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the consolidated financial statements. In evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses, management analyzes several qualitative loan portfolio risk factors including, but not limited to, management's ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical specific loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loan or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. See "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" for additional information.
After an evaluation of these factors, and particularly in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we recorded provisions for loan losses of $60,000 and $152,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our allowance for loan losses was $2.4 million for both the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The ratio of our allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.94% at December 31, 2021 compared to 1.01% at December 31, 2020, while the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans was 810.1% at December 31, 2021 compared to 1,935.3% at December 31, 2020. We had charge-offs of $20,000 and recoveries of $5,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021.
To the best of our knowledge, we have recorded all loan losses that are both probable and reasonable to estimate at December 31, 2021. However, future changes in the factors we use to calculate the allowance for loan losses, including, but not limited to, actual loss experience with respect to our loan portfolio, could result in material increases in our provision for loan losses. In addition, the Office of Comptroller of Currency, as an integral part of its examination process, will periodically review our allowance for loan losses , and as a result of such reviews, we my have to adjust our allowance for loan losses.
Non-interest Income. Non-interest income increased $60,000, or 4.1%, to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $112,000, or 15.3%, as we have increased the number of deposit accounts. Additionally we had a net gain of $46,000 from prepayments of FHLB advances. Offsetting the increase in non-interest income, gain on sale of mortgage loans decreased $202,000, or 43.7%, as we sold $9.1 million of mortgage loans during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $17.7 million of such sales during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Non-interest Expense. Non-interest expense information is as follows.
Salaries and employee benefits expense increased due to annual salary increases and rising benefits expense as well as stock-based compensation related to equity grants. Data processing expense increased due to the annual increase based on CPI index within our contract with our core data processor. Additionally we had a one-time pre-tax $1.6 million expense for the contribution of common stock and cash to the Foundation in the third quarter of 2021.
Income Tax Expense. We recognized income tax expense of $344,000 and $957,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, resulting in effective rates of 16.4% and 21.3%. Income tax expense decreased as a result of lower income before income taxes in 2021. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due to a net loss related to the contribution to the Foundation.
Management of Market Risk
General. Our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. Our Asset/Liability Management Committee, which consists of members of senior management, is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the policy and guidelines approved by our board of directors. We currently utilize a third-party modeling program, prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate our sensitivity to changing interest rates, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors.
We have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates. We have implemented the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk:
•growing our volume of core deposit accounts;
•selling long-term, fixed-rate loans, depending on pricing;
•holding higher levels of cash and cash equivalents;
•continuing the diversification of our loan portfolio by adding more commercial-related loans, which typically have shorter maturities; and
•laddering the maturities of our investment securities and our borrowings.
By following these strategies, we believe that we are better positioned to react to increases and decreases in market interest rates.
We generally do not engage in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures or options, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage backed securities.
Net Interest Income. We analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through a net interest income model. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We estimate what our net interest income would be for a 12-month period. We then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period under the assumptions that the United States Treasury yield curve increases instantaneously by up to 400 basis points or decreases instantaneously by up to 200 basis points, with changes in interest rates representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from 3% to 4% would mean, for example, a 100 basis point increase in the “Change in Interest Rates” column below.
The tables below sets forth, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the calculation of the estimated changes in our net interest income that would result from the designated immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve.
(1)Assumes an immediate uniform change in interest rates at all maturities.
The table above indicates that at December 31, 2021, in the event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a 11.94% increase in net interest income, and in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would experience a 8.45% decrease in net interest income. At December 31, 2020, in the event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we would have experienced an 11.69% increase in net interest income, and in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would have experienced a 7.48% decrease in net interest income.
Net Economic Value. We also compute amounts by which the net present value of our assets and liabilities (economic value of equity, or “EVE”) would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. This model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option-based pricing approach to measure the interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value. The model estimates the economic value of each type of asset, liability and off-balance sheet contract under the assumptions that the United States Treasury yield curve instantaneously by up to 400 basis points or decreases instantaneously by up to 200 basis points, with changes in interest rates representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve.
The tables below sets forth, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the calculation of the estimated changes in our EVE that would result from the designated immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve.
(1)Assumes an immediate uniform change in interest rates at all maturities.
(2)EVE is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts.
(3)Present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest-earning assets.
(4)EVE Ratio represents EVE divided by the present value of assets.
The table above indicates that at December 31, 2021, in the event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a 10.70% decrease in EVE, and in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would experience a 3.76% decrease in EVE. At December 31, 2020, in the event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we would have experienced a 3.45% decrease in EVE, and in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would have experienced a 9.41% decrease in EVE.
Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the net interest income and net economic value tables presented assume that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the tables provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates, and actual results may differ. Furthermore, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In the event of changes in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables.
Interest rate risk calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, decreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of our loans, deposits and borrowings.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, proceeds from the sale of loans, and proceeds from maturities of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had a $111.3 million and a $97.3 million line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, and had $18.5 million and $53.5 million outstanding as of those dates, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had an unsecured federal funds line of credit of $10.0 million. No amount was outstanding on this line of credit at December 31, 2021 or 2020.
While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments including interest-bearing demand deposits. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period.
Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.1 million and $3.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations and the purchase of investment securities and bank owned life insurance, offset by principal collections on loans, proceeds from the sale of securities and proceeds from maturing securities and pay downs on securities, was $22.7 million and $21.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities, consisting primarily of activity in deposit accounts and proceeds from Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, offset by repayment of Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, was $19.1 million and $29.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained.
At December 31, 2021, Cullman Savings Bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements, and was categorized as well capitalized at December 31, 2021. Management is not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent notification that would change our category.
The net proceeds from the offering significantly increased our liquidity and capital resources. Over time, the initial level of liquidity will be reduced as net proceeds from the stock offering are used for general corporate purposes, including funding loans. Our financial condition and results of operations will be enhanced by the net proceeds from the offering, which will increase our net interest-earning assets and net interest income. However, due to the increase in equity resulting from the net proceeds raised in the offering, as well as other factors associated with the offering, our return on equity has bee adversely affected following the offering.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Please refer to Note 1 to the audited financial statements included with this document for a description of recent accounting pronouncements that may affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
The financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates, generally, have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than does inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.
