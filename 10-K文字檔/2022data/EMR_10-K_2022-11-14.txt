ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Safe Harbor Statement
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains various forward-looking statements and includes assumptions concerning Emerson's operations, future results and prospects. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Emerson undertakes no obligation to update any such statements to reflect later developments. In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Emerson provides the cautionary statements set forth under Item 1A - “Risk Factors,” which are hereby incorporated by reference and identify important economic, political and technological factors, among others, changes in which could cause the actual results or events to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by the forward-looking statements and related assumptions.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the Company’s financial information presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), management periodically uses certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” as such term is defined in Regulation G under SEC rules, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For example, non-GAAP measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as acquisitions or divestitures, amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs, discrete taxes, changes in reporting segments, gains, losses and impairments, or items outside of management’s control, such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes that the following non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into the Company’s financial position and operating performance. Any non-GAAP measure provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as identified in italics below. Further, the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies.
Underlying sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the periods presented, are provided to facilitate relevant period-to-period comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact overall comparability (U.S. GAAP measure: net sales).
Operating profit (defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses) and operating profit margin (defined as operating profit divided by net sales) are indicative of short-term operational performance and ongoing profitability. Management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability. EBIT (defined as earnings
before deductions for interest expense, net and income taxes) and total segment EBIT, and EBIT margin (defined as EBIT divided by net sales) and total segment EBIT margin, are financial measures that exclude the impact of financing on the capital structure and income taxes. Adjusted EBITA and adjusted segment EBITA (defined as earnings excluding interest expense, net, income taxes, intangibles amortization expense, restructuring expense, first year purchase accounting related items and transaction fees, and certain gains, losses or impairments) and adjusted EBITA margin and adjusted segment EBITA margin (defined as adjusted EBITA divided by net sales) are measures used by management to evaluate the Company's operational performance, as they exclude the impact of acquisition-related investments and non-operational items. EBITDA (defined as EBIT excluding depreciation and amortization) and EBITDA margin (defined as EBITDA divided by net sales) are also used as measures of the Company's current operating performance, as they exclude the impact of capital and acquisition-related investments. All of these are commonly used financial measures utilized by management to evaluate performance (U.S. GAAP measures: pretax earnings or pretax profit margin, segment earnings or segment margin).
Earnings, earnings per share, return on common stockholders’ equity and return on total capital excluding certain gains and losses, impairments, restructuring costs, impacts of acquisitions or divestitures, amortization of intangibles, discrete taxes, or other items provide additional insight into the underlying, ongoing operating performance of the Company and facilitate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items. Management believes that presenting earnings, earnings per share, return on common stockholders' equity and return on total capital excluding these items is more representative of the Company’s operational performance and may be more useful for investors (U.S. GAAP measures: earnings, earnings per share, return on common stockholders’ equity, return on total capital).
Free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures) and free cash flow as a percent of net sales are indicators of the Company’s cash generating capabilities, and dividends as a percent of free cash flow is an indicator of the Company's ability to support its dividend, after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations. The determination of operating cash flow adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures. Management believes that free cash flow, free cash flow as a percent of net sales and dividends as a percent of free cash flow are useful to both management and investors as measures of the Company’s ability to generate cash and support its dividend (U.S. GAAP measures: operating cash flow, operating cash flow as a percent of net sales, dividends as a percent of operating cash flow).
FINANCIAL REVIEW
Report of Management
The Company's management is responsible for the integrity and accuracy of the financial statements. Management believes that the financial statements for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2022 have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances. In preparing the financial statements, management makes informed judgments and estimates where necessary to reflect the expected effects of events and transactions that have not been completed. The Company's disclosure controls and procedures ensure that material information required to be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and communicated to management and reported within the required time periods.
In meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the financial statements, management relies on a system of internal accounting controls. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization and recorded properly to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Although the design of this system recognizes that errors or irregularities may occur, management believes that the Company's internal accounting controls provide reasonable assurance that errors or irregularities that could be material to the financial statements are prevented or would be detected within a timely period.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of independent directors, is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process. The Audit Committee meets with management and the Company's internal auditors periodically to review the work of each and to monitor the discharge by each of its responsibilities. The Audit Committee also meets periodically with the independent auditors, who have free access to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors, to discuss the quality and acceptability of the Company's financial reporting and internal controls, as well as nonaudit-related services.
The independent auditors are engaged to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Their opinions are based on procedures that they believe to be sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements contain no material errors and that the Company's internal controls are effective.
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. With the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2022.
The Company acquired a controlling interest in Aspen Technology, Inc. during fiscal 2022, and management has excluded this business from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. Total assets and revenues of this business excluded from the assessment represented approximately 36 percent and 2 percent, respectively, of the Company's related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended September 30, 2022.
The Company's auditor, KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

International destination sales, including U.S. exports, increased 2 percent, to $10.6 billion in 2022, reflecting the impact of the Heritage AspenTech acquisition and an increase in the Commercial & Residential Solutions business. U.S. exports of $1.5 billion were up 33 percent compared with 2021, including an increase of approximately $200 due to the Heritage AspenTech acquisition. Underlying international destination sales were up 6 percent, as foreign currency translation had a 5 percent unfavorable impact on the comparison, the AspenTech acquisition added 2 percent and the Therm-O-Disc divestiture subtracted 1 percent.

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES
Portfolio management is an integral component of Emerson's growth and value creation strategy. Over the past 18 months, Emerson has taken significant actions to accelerate the transformation of its portfolio through the completion of strategic acquisitions and divestitures of non-core businesses. These actions were undertaken to create a higher growth and cohesive industrial technology portfolio as a global automation leader serving a diversified set of end markets with differentiated capabilities in intelligent devices and software. The Company’s recent portfolio actions include the following transactions.
On October 31, 2022, the Company announced an agreement to sell a majority stake in its Climate Technologies business (which constitutes the Climate Technologies segment, excluding Therm-O-Disc which was divested earlier in fiscal 2022) to private equity funds managed by Blackstone ("Blackstone") in a transaction valued at $14.0 billion. Emerson will receive upfront, pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $9.5 billion and a note of $2.25 billion at close (which will accrue 5 percent interest payable in kind by capitalizing interest), while retaining a 45 percent non-controlling common equity ownership interest in a new standalone joint venture between Emerson and Blackstone. The Climate Technologies business, which includes the Copeland compressor business and the entire portfolio of products and services across all residential and commercial HVAC and refrigeration end-markets, had fiscal 2022 net sales of approximately $5.0 billion and pretax earnings of $1.0 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2023, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. The Company expects to recognize a pretax gain of approximately $10 billion (approximately $8 billion after-tax) in fiscal 2023 upon the completion of the transaction.
On October 31, 2022, the Company completed the divestiture of its InSinkErator business, which manufactures food waste disposers, to Whirlpool Corporation for $3.0 billion. This business had net sales of $630 and pretax earnings of $152 in fiscal 2022 and is reported in the Tools & Home Products segment. The assets and liabilities of InSinkErator were classified as held-for-sale as of September 30, 2022 and are included in other current assets, other assets, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company expects to recognize a pretax gain of approximately $2.8 billion (approximately $2.1 billion after-tax) in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.
On May 16, 2022, the Company completed the transactions contemplated by its definitive agreement with Aspen Technology, Inc. ("Heritage AspenTech") to contribute two of Emerson's stand-alone industrial software businesses, Open Systems International, Inc. and the Geological Simulation Software business (collectively, the “Emerson Industrial Software Business”), along with approximately $6.0 billion in cash to Heritage AspenTech stockholders, to create "New AspenTech", a diversified, high-performance industrial software leader with greater scale, capabilities and technologies (hereinafter referred to as "AspenTech"). Upon closing of the transaction, Emerson beneficially owned 55 percent of the outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock (on a fully diluted basis) and former Heritage AspenTech stockholders owned the remaining outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock. AspenTech and its subsidiaries now operate under Heritage AspenTech’s previous name “Aspen Technology, Inc.” and AspenTech common stock is traded on NASDAQ under Heritage AspenTech’s previous stock ticker symbol “AZPN.” On a pro forma basis, AspenTech had fiscal 2022 net sales of $1.1 billion.
On July 27, 2022, AspenTech entered into an agreement to acquire Micromine, a global leader in design and operational solutions for the mining industry, for AU $900 (approximately $623 USD based on exchange rates when the transaction was announced). The transaction is expected to close by the end of calendar 2022, subject to various regulatory approvals.
On May 31, 2022 the Company completed the divestiture of its Therm-O-Disc sensing and protection technologies business, which was reported in the Climate Technologies segment, to an affiliate of One Rock Capital Partners, LLC. The Company recognized a pretax gain of $486 ($429 after-tax, $0.72 per share).
On May 4, 2022, Emerson announced its intention to exit business operations in Russia and divest Metran, its Russia-based manufacturing subsidiary, and on September 27, 2022, announced an agreement to sell the business to the local management group. Emerson's historical net sales in Russia were principally in the Automation Solutions segment and in total, represented approximately 1.5 percent of consolidated annual sales. The Company recognized a pretax loss of $181 ($190 after-tax, in total $0.32 per share) related to its exit of business operations in Russia. This charge, which included a loss of $36 in operations and $145 reported in Other deductions ($10 of which is reported in restructuring costs), is primarily non-cash. The transaction will be subject to regulatory and government approvals, and other customary closing conditions. Emerson will work closely with the local Russia management group to help ensure a smooth transition for employees through the sale process.
In 2022, the Company acquired three other businesses, two in the Automation Solutions segment and one in the AspenTech segment, for $130, net of cash acquired. The three businesses had combined annual sales of approximately $40.
On October 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Open Systems International, Inc. (OSI), a leading operations technology software provider in the global power industry, for approximately $1.6 billion, net of cash acquired. This business had net sales of $191 in fiscal 2021 and is now reported in the AspenTech segment.
In 2020, the Company acquired three businesses, two in the Automation Solutions segment and one in the Climate Technologies segment, for $126, net of cash acquired. These three businesses had combined annual sales of approximately $50.
See Note 4 and Item 1A - "Risk Factors" for further information on acquisitions and divestitures.
COST OF SALES
Cost of sales for 2022 were $11,441, an increase of $768 compared with $10,673 in 2021, primarily due to higher sales volume and higher materials costs. Gross profit was $8,188 in 2022 compared to $7,563 in 2021, while gross margin increased 0.2 percentage points to 41.7 percent. The Heritage AspenTech acquisition benefited gross margin 0.7 percentage points, while price less net material inflation was favorable but had a dilutive impact on margins. Higher freight and other inflation also negatively impacted margins, partially offset by favorable mix.
Cost of sales for 2021 were $10,673, an increase of $897 compared with $9,776 in 2020, primarily due to higher sales volume in Commercial & Residential Solutions, foreign currency translation, and the OSI acquisition which added $112 including intangibles amortization of $39. Gross profit was $7,563 in 2021 compared to $7,009 in 2020, while gross margin decreased 0.3 percentage points to 41.5 percent, as leverage on higher sales volume was offset by unfavorable price-cost in Commercial & Residential Solutions primarily driven by higher steel prices, intangibles amortization from the OSI acquisition which deducted 0.2 percentage points, and unfavorable mix.
SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
SG&A expenses of $4,248 in 2022 increased $69 compared with 2021, reflecting the impact of higher sales and higher wage and other inflation. SG&A as a percent of sales decreased 1.3 percentage points to 21.6 percent, reflecting leverage on higher sales and lower stock compensation expense of $80 due to a lower share price in the current year (0.5 percentage points).
SG&A expenses of $4,179 in 2021 increased $193 compared with 2020 on higher stock compensation expense, as well as increased sales volume. SG&A as a percent of sales decreased 0.9 percentage points to 22.9 percent, reflecting increased savings of approximately $240 from the Company's restructuring and cost reset actions, partially offset by higher stock compensation expense of $144 (0.6 percentage points) due to a higher share price in 2021.
INVESTMENT AND DIVESTITURE GAINS
As previously disclosed, the Company sold its network power systems business (rebranded as Vertiv, now a publicly traded company, symbol VRT) in 2017 and retained a subordinated interest contingent upon the equity holders first receiving a threshold cash return on their initial investment. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the equity holders' cumulative cash return exceeded the threshold and as a result, the Company received a distribution of $438 in November 2021 (in total, a pretax gain of $453 was recognized in the first quarter). Based on the terms of the agreement and the current calculation, the Company could receive additional distributions of approximately $75 which are expected to be received over the next two-to-three years. However, the distributions are contingent on the timing and price at which Vertiv shares are sold by the equity holders and therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of the remaining distributions to the Company.
On May 31, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its Therm-O-Disc sensing and protection technologies business to an affiliate of One Rock Capital Partners, LLC. The Company recognized a pretax gain of $486 ($429 after-tax, $0.72 per share). See Note 4.
OTHER DEDUCTIONS, NET
Other deductions, net were $601 in 2022, an increase of $283 compared with 2021, reflecting a charge of $145 related to the Company exiting its business in Russia ($10 of which is reported in restructuring costs), acquisition/divestiture costs of $110, higher intangibles amortization of $57, primarily related to the Heritage AspenTech acquisition, and a mark-to-market loss of $50 related to foreign currency forward contracts entered into by AspenTech to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange associated with the Micromine purchase price. These items were partially offset by lower restructuring costs of $64, gains from the sales of capital assets of $15, and a $14 gain from the acquisition of full ownership of an equity investment. The prior year also had several investment-related gains which are described below. See Notes 5 and 6.
Other deductions, net were $318 in 2021, a decrease of $214 compared with 2020, reflecting lower restructuring costs of $134, investment-related gains, including gains of $21 from an investment sale and $17 from the acquisition of full ownership of an equity investment, and a gain of $31 from the sale of an equity investment, a favorable impact from pensions, and favorable foreign currency transactions of $17. These items were partially offset by higher intangibles amortization of $61, primarily related to the OSI acquisition.
INTEREST EXPENSE, NET
Interest expense, net was $193, $154 and $156 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in 2022 reflects the issuance of $3 billion of long-term debt in December 2021 to support the AspenTech transaction, partially offset by $500 of notes that matured in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES
Pretax earnings of $4,085 increased $1,173 in 2022, up 40 percent compared with 2021 reflecting the impact of the Vertiv and Therm-O-Disc gains discussed above. Earnings increased $401 in Automation Solutions, $19 in AspenTech and $76 in Commercial & Residential Solutions. Costs reported at Corporate increased $223, largely due to the Russia business exit loss and acquisition/divestiture costs, offset by lower stock compensation expense of $80. See the Business Segments discussion that follows and Note 18.
Pretax earnings of $2,912 increased $577 in 2021, up 25 percent compared with 2020. Earnings increased $416 in Automation Solutions, $9 in AspenTech and $246 in Commercial & Residential Solutions. Costs reported at Corporate increased $96, reflecting higher stock compensation expense of $114 and first year acquisition accounting charges and fees related to the OSI acquisition of $50, partially offset by the investment-related gains discussed above and lower unallocated pension and postretirement costs which decreased by $41.
INCOME TAXES
Income taxes were $855, $585 and $345 for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of 21 percent, 20 percent and 15 percent in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The tax rates for 2022, 2021 and 2020 include benefits from restructuring subsidiaries of $11, $13 and $103, respectively. The impact on the 2022 tax rate from the gain on divestiture of the Therm-O-Disc business and the Russia business exit in 2022 essentially offset. The lower rate in 2020 included the impact of a research and development tax credit study. See Note 14.
NET EARNINGS AND EARNINGS PER SHARE
Net earnings attributable to common stockholders in 2022 were $3,231, up 40 percent compared with 2021, and diluted earnings per share were $5.41, up 42 percent compared with $3.82 in 2021. Results reflected strong operating results and included a pretax gain of $453 ($358 after-tax, $0.60 per share) related to the Company's subordinated interest in Vertiv and a pretax gain of $486 ($429 after-tax, $0.72 per share) related to the Therm-O-Disc divestiture. See the analysis of adjusted earnings per share in the Overview section for further details.
Net earnings attributable to common stockholders in 2021 were $2,303, up 17 percent compared with 2020, and diluted earnings per share were $3.82, up 18 percent compared with $3.24 in 2020 due to improved operating results reflecting significant savings from the Company's restructuring and cost reset actions and leverage on higher sales volume in Commercial & Residential Solutions.
The table below, which shows results on an adjusted EBITA basis, is intended to supplement the Company's discussion of its results of operations herein. The Company defines adjusted EBITA as earnings excluding interest expense, net, income taxes, intangibles amortization expense, restructuring expense, first year purchase accounting related items and transaction fees, and certain gains, losses or impairments. Adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBITA margin are measures used by management and may be useful for investors to evaluate the Company's operational performance.

Foreign currency translation had a 3 percent unfavorable impact. Sales for Measurement & Analytical Instrumentation increased $135 or 4 percent. Sales were strong in China and North America, while sales were down moderately in Europe due to supply chain constraints. Valves, Actuators & Regulators increased $121, or 3 percent, reflecting strong demand in the Americas and China, partially offset by softness in the rest of Asia, Middle East & Africa. Industrial Solutions sales increased $137, or 6 percent, reflecting strong demand across all geographies. Systems & Software increased $73, or 3 percent, reflecting strength in process end markets in North America and China, partially offset by weakness in Europe, while power end markets were strong in North America and Europe. Underlying sales increased 14 percent in the Americas (U.S. up 13 percent), while Europe, which was negatively impacted by 5 percentage points due to the business exit from Russia, decreased 1 percent, and Asia, Middle East & Africa was up 5 percent (China up 11 percent). Earnings of $2,356 increased $401 from the prior year, and margin increased 2.7 percentage points to 20.0 percent, reflecting leverage on higher volume, favorable mix, lower restructuring expenses which benefited margins 0.4 percentage points, savings from cost reduction actions and favorable price less net material inflation, partially offset by higher freight and other inflation.
2021 vs. 2020 - Automation Solutions sales were $11.3 billion in 2021, an increase of $266, or 2 percent. Underlying sales were flat as higher prices offset slightly lower volume. Discrete and hybrid markets exhibited strength throughout the year while longer cycle process automation markets began to recover in the second half of the year, including a sharp recovery in core North American automation markets. Foreign currency translation had a 2 percent favorable impact. Sales for Measurement & Analytical Instrumentation decreased $37, or 1 percent, as process industries were weak in the first half of the year, but have improved sequentially as markets continue to recover from the impacts of COVID-19. Valves, Actuators & Regulators decreased $106, or 3 percent, reflecting slower demand in most end markets, particularly in North America and Europe, partially offset by modest growth in Asia. Industrial Solutions sales increased $254, or 13 percent, on strong growth in Europe and robust growth in China, while North American discrete end markets were up moderately. Systems & Software increased $155, or 6 percent. Process end markets were strong in Europe and had moderate growth in Asia while North America was flat.

2022 vs. 2021 - Commercial & Residential Solutions sales were $7.2 billion in 2022, an increase of $580, or 9 percent. Foreign currency translation had a 2 percent unfavorable impact and divestitures deducted 2 percent. Underlying sales increased 13 percent on 3 percent higher volume and 10 percent higher price. Climate Technologies sales were $5.2 billion in 2022, an increase of $452, or 10 percent. Air conditioning, heating and refrigeration sales were strong, reflecting global demand across all end markets. Tools & Home Products sales were $2.0 billion in 2022, up $128 or 7 percent compared to the prior year. Sales of professional tools and food waste disposers were strong, while wet/dry vacuums decreased moderately due to difficult comparisons. Overall, underlying sales increased 15 percent in the Americas (U.S. up 14 percent) and 11 percent in Europe, while Asia, Middle East & Africa increased 5 percent (China down 7 percent). Earnings were $1,440, an increase of $76, and margin was down 0.6 percentage points, as price less net material inflation was favorable but had a slightly dilutive impact on margins and higher freight and other inflation also negatively impacted margins, partially offset by leverage on higher sales and savings from cost reduction actions.
2021 vs. 2020 - Commercial & Residential Solutions sales were $6.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $1,010, or 18 percent. Underlying sales increased 16 percent on strong global demand, as nearly all businesses achieved double-digit growth each quarter, while foreign currency translation added 2 percent. Climate Technologies sales were $4.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $768, or 19 percent. Air conditioning and heating sales were up mid-teens, reflecting strong demand for residential-oriented products and solutions in North America and robust growth in Europe and China. Cold chain sales were up over 20 percent, driven by favorable global market conditions and strength in food retail and aftermarket. Tools & Home Products sales were $1.9 billion in 2021, up $242 or 15 percent compared to the prior year. Sales of wet/dry vacuums were robust in part due to competitor outages, while sales were strong for global professional tools and solid for food waste disposers. Overall, underlying sales increased 16 percent in the Americas (U.S. up 15 percent) and 17 percent in Europe, while Asia, Middle East & Africa increased 17 percent (China up 17 percent). Earnings were $1,364, an increase of $246, and margin was up 0.7 percentage points, reflecting leverage on higher volume and savings from cost reduction actions, partially offset by unfavorable price-cost primarily due to steel price increases which negatively impacted the second half of the fiscal year.
Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources
Emerson maintains a conservative financial structure to provide the strength and flexibility necessary to achieve our strategic objectives and has been successful in efficiently deploying cash where needed worldwide to fund operations, complete acquisitions and sustain long-term growth.
Emerson is in a strong financial position, with total assets of $36 billion and stockholders' equity of $10 billion, and has the resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short- and long-term basis.
The Company continues to generate substantial operating cash flow with over $2.9 billion in each of the last three years. Cash flows have been and are expected to be sufficient for at least the next 12 months to meet the Company’s operating requirements, including those related to salaries and wages, working capital, capital expenditures, and other liquidity requirements associated with operations. The Company also has certain contractual obligations, primarily long-term debt and operating leases (see Notes 7, 10 and 11). The Company has been able to readily meet all its funding requirements and currently believes that sufficient funds will be available to meet its needs for the foreseeable future through operating cash flow, existing resources, short- and long-term debt capacity, or its $3.5 billion revolving backup credit facility under which it has not incurred any borrowings.
CASH FLOW
2020 2021 2022
Operating Cash Flow $ 3,083 3,575 2,922
Percent of sales 18.4 % 19.6 % 14.9 %
Capital Expenditures $ 538 581 531
Percent of sales 3.2 % 3.2 % 2.7 %
Free Cash Flow (Operating Cash Flow less Capital Expenditures)
$ 2,545 2,994 2,391
Percent of sales 15.2 % 16.4 % 12.2 %
Operating Working Capital $ 866 704 1,040
Percent of sales 5.2 % 3.9 % 5.3 %
Operating cash flow for 2022 was $2.9 billion, a $653, or 18 percent decrease compared with 2021, reflecting higher working capital due to increased sales and ongoing supply chain constraints. Operating cash flow of $3.6 billion in 2021 increased 16 percent compared to $3.1 billion in 2020, due to higher earnings. At September 30, 2022, operating working capital as a percent of sales was 5.3 percent compared with 3.9 percent in 2021 and 5.2 percent in 2020. The increase for 2022 compared to the prior year is due to higher inventory levels to support sales growth and reflecting ongoing supply chain constraints. In addition, the Heritage AspenTech acquisition increased operating working capital by approximately $250. As of September 30, 2022, Emerson's cash and equivalents totaled $1.8 billion, which included approximately $380 attributable to AspenTech. The cash held by AspenTech is intended to be used for its own purposes and is not a readily available source of liquidity for other Emerson general business purposes or to return to Emerson shareholders. Contributions to pension plans were $43 in 2022, $41 in 2021 and $66 in 2020.
Capital expenditures were $531, $581 and $538 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures) was $2.4 billion in 2022, down 20 percent. Free cash flow was $3.0 billion in 2021, compared with $2.5 billion in 2020. The Company is targeting capital spending from continuing operations of approximately $350 in 2023. Net cash paid in connection with acquisitions was $5,702, $1,611 and $126 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The Company's agreement to sell a majority stake in its Climate Technologies business will impact its cash flows in future periods after the transaction is completed. In 2022, this business had operating cash flow of approximately $875, capital expenditures of approximately $200, and free cash flow of approximately $675. The Company expects its remaining businesses will continue to generate significant cash flows that will be available to support the return of cash to shareholders and to reinvest for future growth.
On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and among other things, provided tax relief to businesses. Tax provisions of the CARES Act included the deferral of certain payroll taxes, relief for retaining employees, and other provisions. The Company deferred $73 of certain payroll taxes through the end of calendar year 2020, of which approximately $37 was paid in December 2021 with the remaining amount due in December 2022.
Dividends were $1,223 ($2.06 per share) in 2022, compared with $1,210 ($2.02 per share) in 2021 and $1,209 ($2.00 per share) in 2020. In October 2022, the Board of Directors voted to increase the quarterly cash dividend 1 percent, to an annualized rate of $2.08 per share.
Purchases of Emerson common stock totaled $500, $500 and $942 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, at average per share prices of $87.64, $94.65 and $57.41.
In November 2015, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 70 million shares, and during fiscal 2022, the remaining shares available under this authorization were purchased. In March 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an additional 60 million shares and a total of approximately 55 million shares remain available. The Company purchased 5.7 million shares in 2022, 5.3 million shares in 2021 and 16.4 million shares in 2020 under the authorizations.

Interest Coverage Ratio 14.4X 18.6X 18.9X
Total debt, which includes long-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings, was $10,374, $6,665 and $7,486 as of September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increased debt was due to the issuance of $3 billion of long-term debt and increased commercial paper borrowings of approximately $1.3 billion compared to September 30, 2021. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes and the increased commercial paper borrowings to fund the majority of its contribution of approximately $6.0 billion to existing stockholders of Heritage AspenTech as part of the transaction. Long-term debt was issued in December 2021 as follows: $1 billion of 2.0% notes due December 2028, $1 billion of 2.2% notes due December 2031, and $1 billion of 2.8% notes due December 2051. Additionally, the Company repaid $500 of 2.625% notes that matured. See Note 4 and Note 11.
In fiscal 2021, the Company repaid $300 of 4.25% notes that matured and in fiscal 2020 repaid $500 of 4.875% notes that matured. Additionally, in fiscal 2020, the Company issued $500 of 1.8% notes due October 2027, $500 of 1.95% notes due October 2030 and $500 of 2.75% notes due October 2050, and in September 2020, the Company issued $750 of 0.875% notes due October 2026. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes. A portion of the proceeds from the notes issued in September 2020 were also used to fund the acquisition of OSI, which closed on October 1, 2020.
The total debt-to-total capital ratio and net debt-to-net capital ratio (less cash and short-term investments) increased in 2022 due to the increased borrowings to support the AspenTech transaction discussed above, while it decreased in 2021 due to lower long-term debt and higher equity compared to the prior year. The interest coverage ratio is computed as earnings before income taxes plus interest expense, divided by interest expense. The increase in 2022 reflects higher pretax earnings in the current year, which included the Vertiv subordinated interest gain of $453, the gain on the Therm-O-Disc divestiture of $486, and the Russia business exit loss of $181. Excluding these items, the interest coverage ratio was 15.6, reflecting higher interest expense due to the increased long-term debt and commercial paper borrowings to fund the Heritage AspenTech acquisition. The increase in 2021 reflects higher earnings and slightly lower interest expense.
In May 2018, the Company entered into a $3.5 billion five-year revolving backup credit facility with various banks, which replaced the April 2014 $3.5 billion facility. The credit facility is maintained to support general corporate purposes, including commercial paper borrowings. The Company has not incurred any borrowings under this or previous facilities. The credit facility contains no financial covenants and is not subject to termination based on a change of credit rating or material adverse changes. The facility is unsecured and may be accessed under various interest rate alternatives at the Company’s option. Fees to maintain the facility are immaterial. The Company expects to be able to renew its revolving backup credit facility in fiscal 2023 on substantially the same terms as the current facility. The Company also maintains a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which it can issue debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, share purchase contracts or share purchase units without a predetermined limit. Securities can be sold in one or more separate offerings with the size, price and terms to be determined at the time of sale.
Emerson's financial structure provides the flexibility necessary to achieve its strategic objectives. The Company has been successful in efficiently deploying cash where needed worldwide to fund operations, complete acquisitions and sustain long-term growth. At September 30, 2022, the majority of the Company's cash was held outside of the U.S. (primarily in Europe and Asia). The Company routinely repatriates a portion of its non-U.S. cash from earnings each
year, or otherwise when it can be accomplished tax efficiently, and provides for withholding taxes and any applicable U.S. income taxes as appropriate.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, and selectively uses derivative financial instruments, including forwards, swaps and purchased options to manage these risks. The Company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The value of derivatives and other financial instruments is subject to change as a result of market movements in rates and prices. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to forecast the impact of these movements. Based on a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates, a 10 percent decrease in commodity prices or a 10 percent weakening in the U.S. dollar across all currencies, the potential losses in future earnings, fair value or cash flows are not material. Sensitivity analysis has limitations; for example, a weaker U.S. dollar would benefit future earnings through favorable translation of non-U.S. operating results, and lower commodity prices would benefit future earnings through lower cost of sales. See Notes 1, and 9 through 11.
Critical Accounting Policies
Preparation of the Company's financial statements requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates regarding uncertainties that could affect reported revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities and equity. Note 1 describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The most significant areas where management judgments and estimates impact the primary financial statements are described below. Actual results in these areas could differ materially from management's estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company evaluates its contracts with customers to identify the promised goods or services and recognizes revenue for the identified performance obligations at the amount the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied and control has transferred to the customer, typically when products are shipped or delivered, title and risk of loss pass to the customer, and the Company has a present right to payment. The majority of the Company's revenues relate to a broad offering of manufactured products which are recognized at the point in time when control transfers, generally in accordance with shipping terms. A portion of the Company's revenues relate to the sale of software and post-contract customer support, parts and labor for repairs, and engineering services.
In some circumstances, contracts include multiple performance obligations, where revenue is recognized separately for each good or service, as well as contracts where revenue is recognized over time as control transfers to the customer. Tangible products represent a large majority of the delivered items in contracts with multiple performance obligations or where revenue is recognized over time, while a smaller portion is attributable to installation, service and maintenance. In sales arrangements that involve multiple performance obligations, revenue is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Observable selling prices from actual transactions are used whenever possible. In other instances, the Company determines the standalone selling price based on third-party pricing or management's best estimate. For revenues recognized over time, the Company typically uses an input method to determine progress and recognize revenue, based on costs incurred. The Company believes costs incurred closely correspond with its performance under the contract and the transfer of control to the customer.
VALUATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION
Assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, including intangible assets, are accounted for using the acquisition method and recorded at their respective fair values. In fiscal 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Aspen Technology, Inc. and engaged an independent third-party valuation specialist to assist in the determination of the fair value of intangible assets. This included the use of certain assumptions and estimates, including the projected revenue for the customer relationship and developed technology intangible asset and the obsolescence rate for the developed technology intangible asset. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates to be reasonable and appropriate, they require judgement and are based on experience and historical information obtained from Aspen Technology, Inc.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate impairment may exist. If the Company determines that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable, a permanent impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its estimated fair value. Reporting units are also reviewed for possible goodwill impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter. If an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not an impairment may exist, it is evaluated by comparing the reporting unit's estimated fair value to its carrying value. Fair value is generally estimated using an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using discount rates judged by management to be commensurate with the applicable risk. Estimates of future sales, operating results, cash flows and discount rates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including such factors as the general level of market interest rates, expected equity market returns and the volatility of markets served, particularly when recessionary economic circumstances continue for an extended period of time.
RETIREMENT PLANS
The Company maintains a prudent long-term investment strategy consistent with the duration of pension obligations. The determination of defined benefit plan expense and liabilities is dependent on various assumptions, including the expected annual rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and the rate of annual compensation increases. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from the Company's assumptions are accumulated as deferred actuarial gains or losses and amortized to expense in future periods. The Company's principal U.S. defined benefit plan is closed to employees hired after January 1, 2016 while shorter-tenured employees ceased accruing benefits effective October 1, 2016.
As of September 30, 2022, the U.S. pension plans were overfunded by $513 in total (approximately 16 percent in excess of the projected benefit obligation), including unfunded plans totaling $162. The non-U.S. plans were underfunded by $57, including unfunded plans totaling $236. The Company contributed a total of $43 to defined benefit plans in 2022 and expects to contribute approximately $40 in 2023. At year-end 2022, the discount rate for U.S. plans was 5.64 percent, and was 2.92 percent in 2021. The assumed investment return on plan assets was 6.00 percent in 2022, 6.50 percent in 2021 and 6.75 percent in 2020, and will be 6.00 percent for 2023. While management believes its assumptions used are appropriate, actual experience may differ. A 0.25 percentage point decrease in the U.S. and non-U.S. discount rates would have increased the total projected benefit obligation at September 30, 2022 by $100 and increased fiscal 2023 pension expense by $15. A 0.25 percentage point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase fiscal 2023 pension expense by $15. See Note 12.
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
The Company is a party to a number of pending legal proceedings and claims, including those involving general and product liability (including asbestos) and other matters, several of which claim substantial amounts of damages. The Company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs (including legal fees and expenses) will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are based on developments to date; management's estimates of the outcomes of these matters; and the Company's experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. The Company engages an outside expert to develop an actuarial estimate of its expected costs to resolve all pending and future asbestos claims, including defense costs, as well as its related insurance receivables. The reserve for asbestos litigation, which is recorded on an undiscounted basis, is based on projected claims through 2065.
Although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, the Company historically has been largely successful in defending itself against claims and suits that have been brought against it, and will continue to defend itself vigorously in all such matters. While the Company believes a material adverse impact is unlikely, given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future development could have a material adverse impact on the Company. See Note 13.
INCOME TAXES
Income tax expense and tax assets and liabilities reflect management's assessment of taxes paid or expected to be paid (received) on items included in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and consideration of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income taxes are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the
amount that will more likely than not be realized. This requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding the amount and timing of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, expected future taxable income, and the impact of tax planning strategies.
Uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns which remain subject to examination, along with positions expected to be taken in future returns. The Company provides for unrecognized tax benefits, based on the technical merits, when it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. Adjustments are made to the uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit; changes in applicable tax laws, including tax case rulings and legislative guidance; or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.
Cash repatriated to the U.S. is generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes. No provision is made for withholding taxes and any applicable U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries where these earnings are considered indefinitely invested or otherwise retained for continuing international operations. Determination of the amount of taxes that might be paid on these undistributed earnings if eventually remitted is not practicable. See Notes 1 and 14.

LEGAL MATTERS
At September 30, 2022, there were no known contingent liabilities (including guarantees, pending litigation, taxes and other claims) that management believes will be material in relation to the Company's financial statements, nor were there any material commitments outside the normal course of business.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Effective October 1, 2021, the Company adopted three accounting standard updates which had an immaterial or no impact on the Company's financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022. These included:
•Updates to Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 805, Business Combinations, which clarify the accounting for contract assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination. In general, this will result in contract liabilities being recognized at their historical amounts under ASC 606, rather than at fair value in accordance with the general requirements of ASC 805.
•Updates to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which require the recognition of a franchise tax that is partially based on income as an income-based tax with any incremental amount as a non-income based tax. These updates also make certain changes to intra-period tax allocation principles and interim tax calculations.
•Updates to ASC 321, Equity Securities, ASC 323 Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures, and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, which clarify how to account for the transition into and out of the equity method of accounting when evaluating observable transactions.
In fiscal 2021, the Company adopted two accounting standard updates and one new accounting standard, and in fiscal 2020 adopted updates to ASC 815, all of which had an immaterial impact on the Company's financial statements. These included:
•Updates to ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, which eliminate the requirement to measure impairment based on the implied fair value of goodwill compared to the carrying amount of a reporting unit’s goodwill. Instead, goodwill impairment will be measured as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value.
•Updates to ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, which align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a software hosting arrangement with the requirements for costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software.
•Adoption of ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which amends the impairment model by requiring entities to use a forward-looking approach to estimate lifetime expected credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables.
•Updates to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, which permit hedging certain contractually specified risk components. The updates also eliminate the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and simplify hedge documentation and effectiveness assessment requirements.
FISCAL 2023 OUTLOOK
Following the announcement of its Climate Technologies divestiture, Emerson will report financial results for Climate Technologies, InSinkErator and Therm-O-Disc as discontinued operations for all periods presented, beginning in 2023. The earnings from discontinued operations for 2023 are expected to be $10 billion to $11 billion, or $17 to $19 per share, including the net gains on 2023 divestitures.
Emerson expects order strength and backlog to support fiscal 2023 sales growth. For the full year, consolidated net sales from continuing operations are expected to be up 7 to 9 percent, with underlying sales up 6.5 to 8.5 percent excluding a 3.5 percent unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and a 4 percent favorable impact from acquisitions net of divestitures.
Earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to be $3.51 to $3.66 (which excludes any potential impact from the 45 percent common equity ownership in Climate Technologies' income or loss post-close), while adjusted earnings per share are expected to be $4.00 to $4.15, excluding a $0.13 per share impact from restructuring actions, a $0.61 per share impact from amortization of intangibles, $0.10 per share from interest income on the Climate Technologies note receivable, and $0.15 per share of interest income on undeployed proceeds from the Climate Technologies and InSinkErator divestitures.
The Company's fiscal 2023 results from continuing operations after the Climate Technologies divestiture (assumed to close March 31, 2023 for purposes of the guidance above) will include interest income from the $2.25 billion note receivable from Climate Technologies and reflect the 45 percent common equity ownership in the income, or loss, of Climate Technologies. Emerson will not control Climate Technologies post-closing and is therefore unable to estimate the amount of its 45 percent share of Climate Technologies' post-close results. The Company will exclude the interest income from the note receivable from Climate Technologies and its 45 percent share of Climate Technologies' operations in its calculation of fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per share. Also excluded from adjusted earnings per share is the interest income on any undeployed net proceeds. The effect of Emerson's 45 percent share of Climate Technologies is expected to be immaterial to post-closing cash flows. The fiscal 2023 outlook assumes approximately $1.2 billion of dividend payments and approximately $2 billion to be returned to shareholders through share repurchases.
