ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this prospectus. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this prospectus, particularly in “RISK FACTORS.” We caution the reader not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management’s analysis only as of the date of this Annual Report.
We are a smaller reporting company and have not generated any material revenues to date and have incurred substantial losses in connection with our limited operations. We need substantial capital to pursue our current plans to bring our first products to market. The first of such products is a proprietary gel-like protein-based biomedical material for injection into the afflicted body parts of animals suffering from osteoarthritis or other impairments to be marketed under the trade name Spryng™, formerly known as Kush®. It will provide to veterinarians an innovative treatment for dogs and horses suffering from osteoarthritis.
The independent auditor’s report accompanying our March 31, 2022 financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared “assuming that we will continue as a going concern,” which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. We have suffered recurring losses from operations, and our working capital is insufficient to fund our operations for the next 12 months. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
RESULTS OF OPERATION
* In October 2020, the Company approved a 1-for-4 reverse split of our outstanding shares of common stock that was made effective December 29, 2020. All share and per share data has been retroactively adjusted for this reverse split for all period presented.
For The Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2022 (“fiscal 2022”) Compared to The Year Ended March 31, 2021 (“fiscal 2021”)
Total Revenues. Revenues increased to $115,586 in fiscal 2022 compared to $12,578 in fiscal 2021 and consisted of sales to veterinary clinics. The Company began commercialization of its Spryng™ product in September 2021.
Total Cost of Sales. Cost of sales was $201,154 in fiscal 2022 compared to $10,695 for fiscal 2021. The increase is directly related to increased sales of the Spryng™ product. Cost of sales includes product costs related to the sale of products and labor and overhead costs. The increase and the negative gross margin are primarily attributed to our product costs and related product launch expenses from the commercialization of Spryng™ in September 2021.
Operating Expenses. Operating expenses increased to $4,970,960 in fiscal 2022 compared to $1,960,871 in fiscal 2021. Operating expenses consisted of general and administrative, sales and marketing, and research and development expenses. The increase is primarily due to increased G&A expenses and sales and marketing expenses related to the sale of our Spryng™ product.
General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses were $3,148,494 and $1,767,664 in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. General and administrative expenses include compensation and benefits, contracted services, consulting fees, stock compensation and incremental public company costs.
Sales and marketing expenses were $1,347,585 and $94,997 in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sales and marketing expenses include compensation, consulting, tradeshows and stock compensation costs to support the launch of our Spryng™ product.
Research and development (“R&D”) expenses were $474,881 and $98,230 in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase was related to clinical studies and efforts to support the launch of Spryng™.
Operating Loss. As a result of the foregoing, our operating loss was $5,056,528 and 1,958,988 in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase was related to the costs to support the launch of Spryng™ and the incremental public company costs.
Other Income (Expense). Other income was $41,533 in fiscal 2022 as compared to expense of $1,563,792 in fiscal 2021. Other income in fiscal 2022 consisted of the forgiveness of PPP Loan of $31,680 and net interest income of $9,853. Other expense in fiscal 2021 consisted primarily of derivative expense related to debt financing of $1,702,100 and interest expense of $228,595 partially offset by a gain on debt extinguishment of $366,903.
Net Loss. Our net loss in fiscal 2022 was $5,014,995 or ($0.57) as compared to a net loss of $3,522,780 or ($0.57) per share in fiscal 2021. The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 8,760,877 compared to 6,198,717 for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
On August 13, 2021, we closed an underwriting public offering of 2,500,000 units, at a price of $4.50 per unit. Net proceeds from the Public Offering were approximately $9,781,000, net of commissions and expenses of the offering. As of March 31, 2022, our current assets were $6,755,400 including $6,106,827 in cash and cash equivalents. In comparison, our current liabilities as of that date were $1,173,486 including $1,107,759 of accounts payable and accrued expenses. Our working capital as of March 31, 2022 was $5,581,914.
The Company has continued to realize losses from operations. However, as a result of our Public Offering, we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our anticipated operating costs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 10 months. We will need to raise additional capital in the future to support our efforts to commercialize Spryng™ and our ongoing operations. We expect to continue to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities from time to time for the foreseeable future to fund our business expansion. Our ability to obtain such additional capital will likely be subject to various factors, including our overall business performance and market conditions. There can be no guarantee that the Company will be successful in its ability to raise additional capital to fund its business plan.
Net Cash Used in Operating Activities - We used $4,174,957 of net cash in operating activities in fiscal 2022. This cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to our net loss of $5,014,995, forgiveness of PPP loan and accrued interest of $31,680 an increase in inventory of $98,313 and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $208,668 partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $144,874, stock compensation expense of $702,896 stock issued for services of $84,130 and investor relations services paid in stock of $220,050.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities - We used $183,183 of net cash in investing activities in fiscal 2022 consisting of purchase of equipment of $154,030 and costs capitalized to patents and trademarks of $29,154.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities - During fiscal 2022, we were provided with net cash of $10,441,390 from financing activities consisting of $10,242,912 in stock and warrants sale proceeds and a decrease in deferred offering costs of $280,163, which were partially offset by $81,685 in repayments of note payable, including those to directors and a related party.
Inventory
Inventories are stated at cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand through an inventory count.
At March 31, 2022, the Company’s inventory has a carrying value of $98,313 and is broken down into $11,889 of finished goods, $22,960 of work in process and $63,464 in raw material.
At March 31, 2021, the Company’s inventory has a carrying value of $0 and is broken down into $36,973 of finished goods inventory, $8,773 in raw material inventory, and $1,322 in packaging inventory offset by a reserve of $47,068.
MATERIAL COMMITMENTS
Note Payable and Accrued Interest
As of March 31, 2022, we are obligated on notes and accrued interest of $33,750.
PURCHASE COMMITMENTS
The Company issued purchase orders in fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 totaling $250,000 for inventory that we expect to receive within the next year.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
As of March 31, 2022, and as of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
GOING CONCERN
The independent auditors’ report accompanying our March 31, 2022 Form 10-K and financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. In August 2021, we raised approximately $9,781,000 from the sale of units in a Public Offering. Our working capital at March 31, 2022 was $5,581,914. We believe this working capital is sufficient to fund operations for the next ten months (see Liquidity and Capital Resources above).
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards in the United States of America. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements attached hereto. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
The Company has reviewed the FASB issued ASU accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during the periods reported and in future periods. The Company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted accounting principles and do not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the Company’s reported financial position or operations in the near term. The applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of the Company’s financial management.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) - Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts on an Entity’s Own Equity. The ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for the exceptions. The ASU also simplifies the diluted net income per share calculation in certain areas. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of the standard on the consolidated financial statements.
In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). The new ASU addresses issuer’s accounting for certain modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options. This amendment is effective for all entities, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this new guidance will have on its financial statements.
All other newly issued accounting pronouncements but not yet effective have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable.
