ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
We operate as two reportable business segments: Good Times Burgers and Frozen Custard restaurants (“Good Times”) and Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar restaurants (“Bad Daddy’s”). All of our Good Times restaurants compete in the quick service drive-thru segment of the restaurant industry while our Bad Daddy’s restaurants compete in the full-service casual dining segment of the restaurant industry. We believe that providing this additional financial information for each of our brands will provide a better understanding of our overall operating results. Refer to Note 10, Segment Reporting, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.
The Company’s fiscal year is a 52/53-week year ending on the last Tuesday of September. In a 52-week fiscal year, each of the Company’s quarterly periods comprises 13 weeks. The additional week in a 53-week fiscal year is added to the first quarter, making such quarter consist of 14 weeks. Our discussion for the fiscal years ending September 27, 2022 and September 28, 2021 each cover periods of 52 full calendar weeks.
The following tables present information about our reportable segments for the respective periods, all dollar values are represented in thousands:
(1) Restaurant operating costs are expressed as a percentage of restaurant sales.
(2) Includes direct and allocated corporate general and administrative costs.
Bad Daddy’s Restaurants
We currently operate forty company-owned and joint-venture Bad Daddy’s restaurants. We also license one restaurant in North Carolina. We anticipate opening one new Bad Daddy’s restaurant during fiscal 2023. Due to the unusual rate of inflation of our raw products, we cannot, at this time, reasonably predict our expected price increases during fiscal 2023 at our Bad Daddy’s restaurants.
Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custard Restaurants
We currently operate twenty-three company-owned and joint-venture Good Times restaurants all in the state of Colorado. In addition, we have eight Good Times franchise restaurants, six operating in Colorado and two in Wyoming.
Due to the unusual rate of inflation of our raw products, we cannot at this time reasonably predict our expected price increases during fiscal 2023 at our Good Times restaurants.
Impact of Inflation at Both Concepts
Commodity prices, particularly for key proteins have recently been at near-record highs and have exhibited extreme volatility. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 we experienced meaningful price inflation which has continued into our first quarter of 2023. We are experiencing price inflation in most goods, including paper and packaging, other restaurant supplies, and energy (utilities) costs.
In addition to food cost inflation, we have also experienced the need to meaningfully increase wages to attract workers in our restaurants. While we are hopeful that wage rate inflation moderates, the persistent shortage of qualified workers, rather than statutory wage rate increases, which have traditionally created rate pressure, is the primary factor creating upward pressure on wages, as demand for labor is currently significantly exceeding the supply of qualified workers.
We have historically used menu price increases to manage profitability in times of inflation, however the current unusually high rate of inflation, both of goods and labor, exceeds what we believe we can reasonably pass through to our customers without negatively affecting frequency and trial by our customers.
Same Store Sales
Same store sales for each brand represents the comparison of restaurant sales in the current year, to the same comparable weeks in the immediately preceding fiscal year for those stores open for at least 18 months. Same store sales is a commonly used metric in the restaurant industry and management believes it is an indicator of strength of a brand and its existing restaurant locations. Further, management believes that by excluding growth achieved through new unit development, same store sales provide a metric that measures organic growth within the Company’s existing restaurants.
Results of Operations for Fiscal 2022 Compared to Fiscal 2021
Net Revenues: Net revenues for fiscal 2022 increased $14,247,000 (11.5%) to $138,200,000 from $123,953,000 for fiscal 2021. Bad Daddy’s concept revenues increased $14,657,000 while our Good Times concept revenues decreased $410,000.
Bad Daddy’s restaurant sales increased $14,621,000 to $103,216,000 in fiscal 2022 from $88,595,000 in fiscal 2021. This increase is primarily due to increased traffic, including strong off-premise sales, as well as menu price increases. Bad Daddy’s same store restaurant sales increased 11.2% during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Bad Daddy’s restaurants are included in same store sales after they have been open a full eighteen months. This increase is due to average menu price increases throughout the year as well as the continued strength of off-premise sales and strong demand for in-person dining. The average menu price increase was approximately 5.7 % in 2022 over 2021. There were thirty-eight restaurants included in the same store sales base at the end of the fiscal year. Additionally, net revenues for fiscal 2022 were increased by $36,000 in higher franchise royalties and license fees compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily related to the Charlotte Airport licensee. Fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 include franchise advertising contributions of $9,000 and $15,000, respectively.
Additional sales data related to Bad Daddy’s company-owned and joint-venture restaurants:
Good Times restaurant sales decreased $429,000 to $34,034,000 in fiscal 2022 from $34,463,000 in fiscal 2021. This decrease is primarily due to the loss of sales associated with the closure of one restaurant in the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by menu price increases. Same store restaurant sales increased 1.1% during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. This increase is primarily due to menu price increases, slightly offset by lower traffic. One restaurant closed during each of fiscal 2022 and 2021 and were excluded from same store sales. The average menu price increase in fiscal 2022 over fiscal 2021 was approximately 7.7%. Additionally, revenues for fiscal 2022 were increased by $19,000 in higher franchise revenues compared to fiscal 2021. Fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 include franchise advertising contributions of $273,000 and $263,000, respectively.
Average Good Times restaurant sales for company-owned and joint venture restaurants open the entire 2022 and 2021 fiscal years were as follows:
During fiscal 2022, company-operated Good Times restaurants’ sales for restaurants that had been open a full eighteen months ranged from a low of $860,679 to a high of $2,411,766.
Food and Packaging Costs: For fiscal 2022, food and packaging costs increased $7,713,000 to $43,877,000 (32.0% of restaurant sales) compared to the increase in fiscal 2021 to $36,164,000 (29.4% of restaurant sales).
Bad Daddy’s food and packaging costs were $33,155,000 (32.1% of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2022, up from $26,123,000 (29.5% of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2021. This increase is primarily attributable to higher restaurant sales during the current fiscal year versus prior fiscal year. The increase, as a percent of sales, is attributable to significant inflation with most of our food and packaging products seeing meaningful unit price increases, partially offset by the impact of a 5.7 % average annual increase in menu pricing.
Good Times food and packaging costs were $10,722,000 (31.5% of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2022, up from $10,041,000 (29.1% of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2021. This increase is primarily attributable to the impact of higher purchase prices on food and paper goods, partially offset by the impact of a 7.7% increase in menu pricing.
Payroll and Other Employee Benefit Costs: For fiscal 2022, payroll and other employee benefit costs increased $5,466,000 to $46,515,000 (33.9% of restaurant sales) compared to the increase in fiscal 2021 to $41,049,000 (33.4% of restaurant sales).
Bad Daddy’s payroll and other employee benefit costs were $35,085,000 (34.0% of restaurant sales) for fiscal 2022, up from 30,058,000 (33.9% of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2021. The $5,027,000 increase is primarily attributable to greater hours to support increased guests at restaurants during the current year versus the same prior year period, as well as higher average pay rates. As a percent of sales, payroll and employee benefits costs increased by 0.1% primarily attributable to higher average wage rates paid to attract qualified employees.
Good Times payroll and other employee benefit costs were $11,430,000 (33.6% of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2022, up from $10,991,000 (31.9% of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2021. As a percent of sales, payroll and employee benefits costs increased by 1.7% in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. This increase, both in nominal dollars and as measured as a percent of restaurant sales, was primarily attributable to higher average wage rates. These higher wages are in-part driven by a combination of the significant statutory wage increase in the City and County of Denver and the impact of the extremely competitive labor market for qualified restaurant employees in Colorado.
Occupancy Costs: Occupancy costs include rent, real and personal property taxes, common area maintenance expenses, licenses and insurance expense. For fiscal 2022, occupancy costs increased $625,000 from $8,815,000 (8.3% of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2021 to $9,440,000 (6.9% of restaurant sales).
Bad Daddy’s occupancy costs were $6,668,000 (6.5% of restaurant sales) for fiscal 2022, up from $5,959,000 (6.7% of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2021. The $709,000 increase was primarily attributable to lease costs with newly opened restaurants and increased property tax assessments. The decrease as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the leveraging effect of higher restaurant sales.
Good Times occupancy costs were $2,772,000 (8.1% of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2022, down from $2,856,000 (8.3% of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2021. The decrease, as a percentage of sales, was due to the closure of one restaurant in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the leveraging effect of increased restaurant sales, decreases in property tax expense, end-of-term rent abatement, and associated with a lease termination agreement for one good times restaurant.
Other Operating Costs: For fiscal 2022, other operating costs increased $3,604,000 from $14,911,000 (12.1% of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2021 to $18,515,000 (13.5% of restaurant sales).
Bad Daddy’s other operating costs were $14,519,000 (14.1% of restaurant sales) for fiscal 2022, up from $11,647,000 (13.1% of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2021. The $2,872,000 increase was attributable to higher overall sales. As a percent of sales, the increase is attributable to higher increased spending on restaurant technology, and higher repair and maintenance expenses.
Good Times other operating costs were $3,996,000 (11.7% of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2022, up from $3,264,000 (9.5% of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to general price inflation in operating supplies costs, increases in commissions paid to delivery service providers due to increases in overall delivery sales, and higher repair and higher preventive maintenance expenses.
New Store Preopening Costs: For fiscal 2022, we incurred $51,000 of preopening costs compared to $766,000 in fiscal 2021. All of the preopening costs are related to our Bad Daddy’s restaurants. The costs in the prior year were related to a Bad Daddy’s restaurant opened near the end of fiscal 2021.
Preopening costs in the current fiscal year are attributable to one restaurant that was purchased from a franchisee in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Preopening costs in the prior fiscal year were primarily attributable to two restaurants that opened during the third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2021. Preopening costs typically occur over a period of approximately five months and we typically spend approximately $275,000 to $350,000 per location.
Depreciation and Amortization Costs: Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on capital expenditures for restaurants and corporate assets as well as amortization of acquired franchise rights and leasehold interests. For fiscal 2022, depreciation and amortization costs increased $53,000 from to $3,842,000 in fiscal 2021to $3,895,000 in fiscal 2022.
Bad Daddy’s depreciation costs increased $139,000 from $3,095,000 in fiscal 2021 to $3,234,000 in fiscal 2022. This increase was primarily attributable to the two new restaurants opened in final quarter of fiscal 2021 as well as the acquisition of our franchise unit in the second quarter of 2022.
Good Times depreciation costs decreased $86,000 from $747,000 in fiscal 2021 to $661,000 in fiscal 2022. This decrease is primarily attributable to assets reaching full amortization and the closure of a restaurant in fiscal 2022 associated with a landlord termination option.
General and Administrative Costs: General and administrative costs include all corporate and administrative functions. Components of this category include accounting and administrative costs, regional and franchise support salaries and benefits; professional and consulting fees; travel; corporate information systems; training; board of directors’ expenses; office rent; and legal expenses. For fiscal 2022, general and administrative costs increased $1,069,000 from $9,437,000 (7.6% of total revenue).in fiscal 2021 to $10,506,000 (7.6% of total revenue) in fiscal 2022.
The $1,069,000 increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2022 is primarily attributable to:
● Increase of $591,000 in legal and professional services fees
● Increase of $327,000 in recruiting and training-related costs, including travel and temporary lodging for new managers during their training period, costs related to our annual general manager conference, and costs related to a training event for multi-unit managers from both brands
● Increase of $124,000 related to a reduction of vendors fee income
● Increase of $109,000 related to regional manager expenses
● Increase of $155,000 related to increased home office payroll and benefit costs
● Increase of $88,000 related to business insurance including D&O, EPL, and cyber coverage
● Increase of $189,000 in technology-related expenses
● Increase of $56,000 in general travel-related expenses
● Increase of $31,000 in general office expenses
● Decrease of $473,000 in to, reduced health insurance costs and underwriting losses
● Decrease of $111,000 in incentive stock compensation
● Net decreases in all other expenses of $17,000
We expect general and administrative costs to continue to increase slightly from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023 due to increased insurance and health costs, and as we make investments in new human resource and financial management systems.
Advertising Costs: For fiscal 2022, advertising costs increased $1,082,000 from $2,082,000 (1.7% of total revenues) in fiscal 2021 to $3,164,000 (2.3% of total revenues) in fiscal 2022.
Bad Daddy’s advertising costs increased $959,000 from $868,000 (1.0% of total revenues) in fiscal 2021 to $1,827,000 (1.8% of total revenues) in fiscal 2022. The increase is primarily due to recognition of commission earned by third parties on gift cards sold through large-box retailers and a radio advertising campaign in Colorado. Bad Daddy’s advertising costs consist primarily of menu development, printing costs, local store marketing and social media. All restaurants contribute to an advertising materials fund based on a percentage of restaurant sales. The current and prior years include advertising costs of $9,000 and $15,000, respectively, associated with franchise advertising contributions.
We anticipate that in fiscal 2023, Bad Daddy’s advertising costs as a percentage of total revenues will remain consistent with fiscal 2022.
Good Times advertising costs increased $123,000 from $1,214,000 (3.5% of total revenues) in fiscal 2021 to $1,337,000 (3.9% of total revenues) in fiscal 2022. The increase is primarily due to increased advertising expenditures. Good Times advertising costs consists primarily of contributions made to the advertising materials fund and a regional advertising cooperative based on a percentage of restaurant sales which are used to provide radio advertising, social media, on-site and point-of-purchase materials. The percentage contribution paid to the regional advertising cooperative was reduced at the start of the current fiscal year associated with a change in expected media mix. Advertising costs are presented gross, with franchisee contributions to the fund being recognized as a component of franchise revenues.
We anticipate that in fiscal 2023 Good Times advertising costs as a percentage of net revenues will remain relatively stable, between approximately 3.0% and 3.5%.
Franchise Costs: For fiscal 2022, franchise costs decreased $5,000 from $27,000 in fiscal 2021 to $22,000 in fiscal 2022. The costs are primarily related to the Good Times franchised restaurants. We currently have minimal direct costs associated with maintaining our franchise systems as those employees overseeing franchisee relations primarily perform responsibilities associated with company operations.
Gain or Loss on Restaurant Asset Disposals: For fiscal 2022, the gain on restaurant asset disposals was $676,000 compared to a gain of $37,000 in fiscal 2021. The gain in both fiscal 2022 and 2021 is primarily comprised of a deferred gain on previous sale lease-back transactions related to two Good Times restaurants, as well as the termination of a lease of a good times restaurant.
Long-lived Asset Impairment Charges: For fiscal 2022, the asset impairment charge was $3,437,000 compared to no impairment charge being recorded in fiscal 2021. We review long-lived assets and intangibles subject to amortization for impairment when there are factors that indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. We recorded non-cash charges of $790,000 related to 3 Good Times restaurants located in Colorado. We recorded non-cash charges of $2,647,000 related to 2 Bad Daddy’s locations
Goodwill Impairment Charges: We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever indications of impairment arise. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, no goodwill impairment charges were deemed necessary.
Litigation Contingencies: The Company recorded a contingent loss of $332,000 in fiscal 2022 related to in-process litigation. No similar losses were recorded during Fiscal 2021.
(Loss) Income from Operations: Loss from operations was $878,000 in fiscal 2022 compared to income of $6,897,000 in fiscal 2021.
The change from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2022 was primarily attributable to the increase in net revenues, offset by an increase in asset impairment costs, an increase in food and packaging and payroll and other employee benefit costs, as well as other changes discussed in the "Occupancy Costs", :Other Operating Costs”, “New Store Preopening Costs”, “Depreciation and Amortization”, "General and Administrative Costs", “Advertising Costs”, “Franchise Costs”, and “Gain on Restaurant Asset Disposals” sections above.
Gain on Debt Extinguishment: There was no gain on debt extinguishment in fiscal 2022.
Gain on debt extinguishment in fiscal 2021 was $11,778,000. This gain was related to the forgiveness of the Company’s PPP loans. The breakdown of the forgiveness amount by operating segment is as follows:
Net (Loss) Income: Net loss for fiscal 2022 was $932,000 compared to net income of $18,406,000 in fiscal 2021. The change from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2022 was primarily attributable to the matters discussed in the "Net Revenues", "Food and Packaging Costs", “Payroll and Other Employee Benefits Costs,” "General and Administrative Costs", "Long-lived Asset Impairment Charges” sections above.
Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests: For fiscal 2022, the income attributable to non-controlling interests was $1,714,000 compared to $1,613,000 in fiscal 2021. The non-controlling interest represents the limited partner’s share of income in the Good Times and Bad Daddy’s joint-venture restaurants. $1,185,000 of the current year income is attributable to the Bad Daddy’s joint-venture restaurants, compared to $822,000 in the prior year. $529,000 of the current year income is attributable to the Good Times joint-venture restaurants, compared to $791,000 in the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA
EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA, adjusted for non-cash stock-based compensation expense, preopening expense, non-recurring acquisition costs, U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) rent in excess of cash rent, non-cash disposal of assets and non-cash asset impairment charges. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and operating results. Our management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (i) as a factor in evaluating management's performance when determining incentive compensation and (ii) to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies.
We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company's financial measures with other restaurants, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. In addition, you should be aware when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. Our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies do not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.
Our management does not consider EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company's financial statements. Some of these limitations are:
● Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
● Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
● Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debts;
● Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;
● Stock based compensation expense is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing performance for a particular period;
● Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and
● Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only as a supplementary measure. You should review the reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.
The following table reconciles net income (loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):
(a) Depreciation and amortization expenses are presented net of the share attributable to the non-controlling interest.
(1) Represents expenses directly associated with the opening of new restaurants, including preopening rent.
(2) Represents non-cash stock-based compensation as described in Note 8 to the financial statements.
(3) Represents the excess of cash rent incurred over the amount of GAAP rent recorded in the financial statements.
(4) Primarily related to deferred gains on previous sale-leaseback transactions on two Good Times restaurants.
(5) Represents costs recognized in connection the asset impairment charges as described in Note 1 to the financial statements.
Depreciation and amortization, preopening expense, and asset impairment charge have been reduced by any amounts attributable to non-controlling interests.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and Working Capital: As of September 27, 2022, we had a working capital deficit of $1,036,000. Our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day, or in the case of credit or debit card transactions, within a few days of the related sale. Although we have two to four weeks to pay many of our vendors, we currently are paying our primary foodservice vendors on 1-3 day payment terms to take advantage of early pay discounts. Our current working capital deficit is largely caused by the recognition of short-term lease liabilities, as we lease substantially all of our real estate and have both current- and long-term obligations to our landlords. We believe that we will have sufficient capital to meet our working capital, and recurring capital expenditure needs in fiscal 2023. As of September 27, 2022, the Company had approximately $204,000 in outstanding construction commitments related to signage upgrades at some of our currently operating Good Times restaurants. We anticipate any commitments in fiscal 2023 will be funded out of existing cash or future borrowings against the Cadence Credit Facility.
Financing
Cadence Credit Facility:
The Company maintains a credit agreement with Cadence Bank (“Cadence”) pursuant to which, as amended, Cadence has agreed to loan the Company up to $8,000,000 with a maturity date of January 31, 2023 (as amended, the “Cadence Credit Facility”). As amended by the various amendments, the Cadence Credit Facility accrues commitment fees on the daily unused balance of the facility at a rate of 0.25%. As of the date of filing of this report, any borrowings under the Cadence Credit Facility, as amended, bear interest at a variable rate based upon the Company’s election of (i) 2.5% plus the base rate, which is the highest of the (a) Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5%, (b) the Cadence Bank publicly announced prime rate, and (c) LIBOR plus 1.0%, or (ii) LIBOR, with a 0.250% floor, plus 3.5%. Interest is due at the end of each calendar quarter if the Company elects to pay interest based on the base rate and at the end of each LIBOR period if it elects to pay interest based on LIBOR. The Cadence Credit Facility includes provisions for the Administrative Agent of the facility to amend the facility to replace LIBOR with an alternate benchmark rate, which may be (but is not required to be) SOFR, at such point in time when appliable LIBOR rates are no longer available or no longer reliable. The exact timing of any transition of LIBOR to an alternate benchmark rate is not currently known. The Company is currently reviewing its future credit facility needs and intends to negotiate an amendment to the existing credit agreement or enter into a new credit agreement prior to January 31, 2023.
As of the date of filing this report, the Cadence Credit Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that the Company considers customary for an agreement of this type, including financial covenants setting a maximum leverage ratio of 5.15:1, a minimum pre-distribution fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25:1, a minimum post-distribution fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.10:1 and minimum liquidity of $2.0 million. As of the date of filing this report, the Company was in compliance with all of these financial covenants under the Cadence Credit Facility.
As a result of entering into the Cadence Credit Facility and the various amendments, the Company paid loan origination costs including professional fees of approximately $308,500 and is amortizing these costs over the term of the credit agreement.
The obligations under the Cadence Credit Facility are collateralized by a first-priority lien on substantially all of the Company’s assets.
As of the date of filing this report, there were no outstanding borrowings against the facility. Availability of the Cadence Credit Facility for borrowings is reduced by the outstanding face value of any letters of credit issued under the facility. As of the date of filing this report, there were no outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility.
On May 7, 2020, Good Times and three of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, BDI, Drive Thru, and BD of Colo (each a “Borrower”), entered into unsecured loans in the aggregate principal amount of $11,645,000 (the “Loans”) with Cadence Bank, N.A. (the “Lender”) pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program.
In June 2021, the SBA approved forgiveness in full of the Loans, including accrued interest, in the aggregate amount of $11,778,226, which was recognized as gain on debt extinguishment in the fiscal year ended September 28, 2021. The principal and accrued interest balance on each of these Loans is now zero, as of the forgiveness date specific to each of the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ Loans.
Total interest expense on notes payable and capital leases was $20,000 and $269,000 for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.

Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: We remain contingently liable on various leases underlying restaurants that were previously sold to franchisees. We have never experienced any losses related to these contingent lease liabilities, however if a franchisee defaults on the payments under the leases, we would be liable for the lease payments as the assignor or sub-lessor of the lease. Currently we have not been notified nor are we aware of any leases in default by the franchisees, however there can be no assurance that there will not be in the future which could have a material effect on our future operating results.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates: Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by the application of our accounting policies. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that require application of management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. While we apply our judgment based on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could vary from these assumptions. Additionally, in the context of the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, future facts and circumstances could change and impact our estimates and assumptions. It is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using different assumptions. The following is a description of what we consider to be our most significant accounting policies.
Leases: The Company determines if a contract contains a lease at inception. The Company's material long-term operating lease agreements are for the land and buildings for our restaurants as well as our corporate office. The initial lease terms range from 10 years to 20 years, most of which include renewal options of 10 to 15 years. The lease term is generally the minimum of the noncancelable period or the lease term including renewal options which are reasonably certain of being exercised up to a term of approximately 20 years.
Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date for material leases with a term of greater than 12 months. Operating lease liabilities represent the present value of future minimum lease payments. Since our leases do not provide an implicit rate, our operating lease liabilities are calculated using our estimated incremental borrowing rate based on a collateralized borrowing over the term of each individual lease. Minimum lease payments include only fixed lease components of the agreement, as well as variable rate payments that depend on an index, initially measured using the index at the lease commencement date.
Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset and are based upon the operating lease liabilities adjusted for prepaid or accrued lease payments, initial direct costs and lease incentives. Lease incentives are recognized when earned and reduce our operating lease asset related to the lease. They are amortized through the operating lease assets as reductions of rent expense over the lease term.
Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain of the Company’s operating leases contain clauses that provide for contingent rent based on a percentage of sales greater than certain specified target amounts. Variable lease payments that do not depend on a rate or index, escalation in the index subsequent to the initial measurement, payments associated with non-lease components such as common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, and short-term lease payments (leases with a term with 12 months or less) are expensed as incurred or when the achievement of the specified target that triggers the contingent rent is considered probable. During the fiscal year ended September 27, 2022 the Company incurred $136,000 of contingent rent.
Some of the leases provide for base rent, plus additional rent based on gross sales, as defined in each lease agreement. The Company is also generally obligated to pay certain real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges, and various other expenses related to properties, which are expensed as incurred.
Employee Medical Plans: We sponsor health and welfare plans that provides medical insurance benefits to certain of our employees. We partially self-insure against claims made by participants in this plan and maintain coverage above a certain threshold for claims against individual claimants within a plan year (the “stop loss limit”). Prior to each plan year, we underwrite the plans based upon their then-current membership and estimate aggregate claims costs for the next plan year for each plan on a per-member average basis. Estimated costs (net of any employee contribution) are recognized as part of restaurant labor for restaurant employees. Estimated costs (net of any employee contribution) for non-restaurant employees are recognized as part of General and Administrative expenses. During the year, we periodically review claims costs against estimates made prior to the inception of the plan year. Significant differences between actual and estimated claims activity (“underwriting losses” or “underwriting gains”) are recognized as part of General and Administrative expenses. Due to the relatively small number of members in the plans, should we have a significant number of members with high-cost claims in any given year, we may experience significant underwriting losses.
Non-controlling Interests: Non-controlling interests are presented as a separate item in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. Consolidated net income or loss attributable to non-controlling interests are presented on the face of the consolidated statement of operations. Additionally, changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions, and that deconsolidation of a subsidiary is recorded as a gain or loss based on the fair value on the deconsolidation date.
Income Taxes: We account for income taxes under the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We provide a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value. We continually review the realizability of our deferred tax assets, including an analysis of factors such as future taxable income, reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, and tax planning strategies. We assessed whether a valuation allowance should be recorded against our deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, using a “more likely than not” standard. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we considered both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets. In making such assessment, more weight was given to evidence that could be objectively verified, including recent cumulative losses. Future sources of taxable income were also considered in determining the amount of the recorded valuation allowance. Based on our review of this evidence, we determined that a full valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets was appropriate. As we increase earnings and utilize deferred tax assets in the future, it is possible the valuation allowance could be reduced or eliminated.
The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax and income tax in multiple U.S. state jurisdictions. The Company continues to remain subject to examination by federal authorities and state jurisdictions generally for fiscal years after 2017. The Company believes that its income tax filings positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded. The Company’s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. We have accrued $0 for interest and penalties as of September 27, 2022.
Variable Interest Entities: Once an entity is determined to be a Variable Interest Entity (VIE), the party with the controlling financial interest, the primary beneficiary, is required to consolidate it. We previously had three franchisees with notes payable and after analysis we had determined that, while the franchisees were VIE’s, we are not the primary beneficiary of the entities, and therefore they are not required to be consolidated. We no longer have any notes receivable from any of our franchisees.
