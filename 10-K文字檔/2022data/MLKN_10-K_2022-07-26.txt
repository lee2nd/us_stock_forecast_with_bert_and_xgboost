Executive Overview
MillerKnoll is a collective of dynamic brands that comes together to design the world we live in. From the spaces we make that help us live and work better, to how we manufacture our products, to the ways we solve challenges facing our customers and global community, design is our tool for creating positive impact. Our optimism leads us as we redefine modern for the 21st century, shaping a future that’s more sustainable, caring, and beautiful for all people and our planet.
In July 2021, the Company finalized the acquisition of Knoll, Inc. (“Knoll”) in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $1.8 billion. On November 1, 2021, Herman Miller, Inc. changed its name to MillerKnoll, Inc., and the company began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol MLKN.
MillerKnoll's products are sold internationally through controlled subsidiaries or branches in various countries including the United Kingdom, Denmark, Italy, France, the Netherlands, Canada, Japan, Mexico, Australia, Singapore, China, Hong Kong, India, and Brazil. The Company’s products are sold in over 100 countries primarily through independent contract furniture dealers, direct customer sales, owned and independent retailers, direct-mail catalogs, and the Company’s eCommerce platforms.
The Company is globally positioned in terms of manufacturing operations. In North America, manufacturing operations are in Connecticut, Illinois, Georgia, New York, North Carolina, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin in the United States, as well as Toronto and Mexico City. In Europe, the Company's manufacturing presence is in the United Kingdom and Italy. Manufacturing operations globally also include facilities located in Brazil, Mexico, China, and India. The Company manufactures products using a system of lean manufacturing techniques collectively referred to as the MillerKnoll Performance System (MKPS). For its contract furniture business, MillerKnoll strives to maintain efficiencies and cost savings by minimizing the amount of inventory on hand. Accordingly, production is order-driven with direct materials and components purchased as needed to meet demand. These factors result in a high rate of inventory turns related to our manufactured inventories.
A key element of the Company's manufacturing strategy is to limit fixed production costs by sourcing component parts from strategic suppliers. This strategy has allowed the Company to increase the variable nature of its cost structure, while retaining proprietary control over those production processes that the Company believes provide a competitive advantage. As a result of this strategy, the Company's manufacturing operations are largely assembly-based .
A key element of the Company's growth strategy is to scale the Global Retail business through the Company's Design Within Reach ("DWR"), HAY, and Herman Miller retail operations. The Global Retail business provides a channel to bring MillerKnoll's iconic and design-centric products to retail customers, along with other proprietary and third-party products, with a focus on modern design. The Company continues to transform its Global Retail business through store expansion & fleet optimization, which will be complemented by continued focus on assortment expansion (including proprietary and exclusive products), the launch of new eCommerce sites and ongoing digital optimization of existing eCommerce sites and marketing programs.
The Company is comprised of various operating segments as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The operating segments are determined on the basis of how the Company internally reports and evaluates financial information used to make operating decisions. The Company has identified the following segments:
•Americas Contract - Includes the operations associated with the design, manufacture, and sale of furniture and textile products for work-related settings, including office, healthcare, and educational environments, throughout North America and South America. In addition to the Herman Miller brand, naughtone brand, and the DWR Contract business, this segment includes the operations associated with the design, manufacture, and sale of high-craft furniture products and textiles including Geiger wood products, Maharam textiles, and Herman Miller Healthcare.
