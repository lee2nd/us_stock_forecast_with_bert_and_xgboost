ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this annual report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. You should read the “Risk Factors” and “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” sections of this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
We are a biotechnology company devoted to discovering and developing innovative therapies designed to treat immune-mediated diseases. Our lead product candidate, reproxalap, is a first-in-class treatment in late-stage development for dry eye disease (DED) and allergic conjunctivitis (AC). We have additional product candidates in development for autoimmune diseases and other immune-mediated diseases, as well as for proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) and other retinal diseases. We currently intend to commercialize our products directly or through collaborations. None of our product candidates have been approved for sale in the United States or elsewhere.
Our lead product candidate reproxalap is a RASP (reactive aldehyde species) modulator that has demonstrated statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements across a number of Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials in DED and AC when administered topically to the eye as an ophthalmic solution. Additionally, in a Phase 1 clinical trial, ADX-629, a first-in-class orally available RASP modulator, was well-tolerated and no treatment-related adverse events were observed. Relative to subjects treated with placebo, reduction in the commonly described pro-inflammatory RASP malondialdehyde was observed in ADX-629 treated subjects. A growing body of clinical evidence supports the potential and relevance of RASP modulation as a new and differentiated mechanism of action. We have discovered and are developing additional RASP modulator. The RASP modulator platform represents a unique and novel pharmacologic approach that, unlike almost all drugs in use today, does not directly inhibit or activate a particular protein but instead targets a family of small molecules that in turn affect the activity and structure of many proteins at once. RASP modulation, therefore, has the potential to down-regulate pro-inflammatory systems or groups of proteins, and may lead to multiple beneficial clinical effects while avoiding toxicity associated with single-target inhibition or activation.
As we continue to execute on our strategy of expanding our product candidate pipeline, we may license or acquire new immune-modulating approaches with novel therapeutic potential. In January 2019, we acquired Helio Vision, Inc. (Helio) and thereby obtained rights to ADX-2191, a vitreous-compatible methotrexate formulation for intraocular injection, a serious sight-threatening retinal disease with no approved treatment and primary vitreoretinal lymphoma (PVRL), a rare cancer with no approved treatment. In addition, in December 2016, we in-licensed ADX-1612, which inhibits the protein chaperome, a mechanistically differentiated approach for the potential treatment of inflammatory diseases. In the future, we may enter into additional partnerships that facilitate the development and commercialization of our product candidates.
Since our incorporation, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenues largely depends upon our ability, alone or with others, to complete development of our product candidates to obtain regulatory approvals for and to manufacture, market, and sell our product candidates. The results of our operations will vary significantly from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter, and depend on a number of factors, including risks related to our business and industry, risks relating to intellectual property and other legal matters, risks related to our common stock, and other risks that are detailed in the section of this annual report on Form 10-K entitled “Risk Factors".
In December 2018, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement SM (2018 Jefferies Sales Agreement) with Jefferies LLC (Jefferies), as sales agent, pursuant to which we offered and sold, shares of our common stock, for aggregate sales proceeds of $50.0 million from time to time through Jefferies. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold, at a volume-weighted average price of $4.62, an aggregate of 9.4 million shares of common stock
and received $40.7 million after deducting commissions related to the 2018 Jefferies Sales Agreement and other offering costs. As of December 31, 2020, we had sold the maximum allowable amount and no further sales may be made under the 2018 Jefferies Sales Agreement.
In March 2019, we entered into the Hercules Credit Facility, which provided for a term loan of up to $60.0 million, $15.0 million of which has been drawn-down as of December 31, 2021. In April 2021, the Hercules Credit Facility was amended to, among other things, increase the amount which may become available for draw-down prior to May 2023, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions contained therein, from $10.0 million to $20.0 million. The Hercules Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. Affirmative covenants include, among others, covenants requiring us to maintain our legal existence and governmental approvals, deliver certain financial reports, and maintain insurance coverage. Negative covenants include, among others: restrictions on transferring any part of our business or intellectual property; incurring additional indebtedness; engaging in mergers or acquisitions; paying dividends or making other distributions; making investments; and creating other liens on our assets, in each case subject to customary exceptions. The Hercules Credit Facility, as amended, is described in Note 9 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2021, $15.0 million was outstanding under the Hercules Credit Facility, and no additional amounts were available for borrowing.
In January 2021, we sold 7.9 million shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at $9.50 per share, for an aggregate gross cash purchase price of $74.7 million or proceeds of $70.0 million after underwriters’ discount, commissions, and other offering expenses.
In March 2021, we entered into an Open Market Sales Agreement SM (2021 Jefferies Sales Agreement) with Jefferies, as sales agent, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time through Jefferies, shares of common stock providing for aggregate sales proceeds of up to $100.0 million. We have no obligation to sell any shares under the 2021 Jefferies Sales Agreement, and could at any time suspend solicitations and offers under the 2021 Jefferies Sales Agreement. No sales had been made pursuant to the 2021 Jefferies Sales Agreement as of December 31, 2021.
In May and June 2021, we sold an aggregate of 10.2 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $12.50 per share, in an underwritten public offering, for an aggregate gross cash purchase price of $127.8 million or proceeds of approximately $119.8 million after underwriters’ discount, commissions, and other offering expenses, which included the partial exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares.
We will need to raise additional capital in the form of debt or equity or through partnerships to fund additional development of our product candidates and, subject to regulatory approval, if any, the commercialization of our product candidates, and we may in-license, acquire, or invest in complementary businesses or products. In addition, as capital resources permit, we may augment or otherwise modify the clinical development plans described herein. However, any disruption in the capital markets caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could make any financing more challenging, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
Our Agreement with Madrigal
We are developing ADX-1612 pursuant to a License Agreement with Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Madrigal), entered into on December 26, 2016 (Madrigal Agreement). Pursuant to the Madrigal Agreement, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license from Madrigal under certain patents and patent applications, and other licenses to intellectual property, to develop and commercialize Hsp90 inhibitors, including ADX-1612 (investigated in oncology under the name ganetespib), (collectively, Madrigal Agreement Products). We have agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to develop Madrigal Agreement Products.
In consideration for the rights licensed under the Madrigal Agreement, we paid Madrigal an upfront license fee of $250,000 and are obligated to make future regulatory and development and sales-dependent milestone payments to Madrigal of less than $340 million in the aggregate (over 80% of such amount being tied to our achievement of increasingly greater annual worldwide net sales milestones), as well as royalty payments to Madrigal at a rate which, as a percentage of net sales, is in the high single digits for products containing ADX-1612 and mid-single digits for any other Hsp90 inhibitor product. We are also obligated under the Madrigal Agreement to pay Madrigal a percentage of certain sublicense revenue that we receive in connection with entering into any sublicensing arrangements with any third parties, at a percentage rate which tiers downward from the mid-twenties to low-single digits based on the development stage of the product at the time of the sublicense.
The Madrigal Agreement will remain in effect until all payment obligations under the Madrigal Agreement expire. We may terminate the Madrigal Agreement in its entirety or on a Madrigal Agreement Product-by Madrigal Agreement Product basis with timely notice to Madrigal. Either party may terminate the Madrigal Agreement for uncured material breach by the other party or upon certain insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings involving the other party, both with timely notice to the other party. In addition, Madrigal has the right to terminate the Madrigal Agreement if we, our affiliates, or sublicensees interferes with, challenges the validity or enforceability of, opposes the extension of, or grant of a supplementary protection certificate with respect to any of our licensed patents under the Madrigal Agreement. In the event of an early termination of the Madrigal Agreement, all rights licensed and developed by us under the Madrigal Agreement may revert back to Madrigal. Each party has agreed to indemnify the other party for certain third party claims arising under the Madrigal Agreement.
Our Agreement with MEEI
We are developing ADX-2191 pursuant to an Exclusive License Agreement with Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (MEEI) originally entered into in July 2016 between MEEI and Helio Vision, Inc., as amended, (MEEI Agreement). We assumed the MEEI Agreement in connection with our 2019 acquisition of Helio Vision.
Pursuant and subject to the MEEI Agreement, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license from MEEI to develop and commercialize ADX-2191 under certain patents and patent applications, and other licenses to intellectual property (MEEI Patent Rights). We have agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to develop ADX-2191 and to meet certain specified effort and achievement benchmarks by certain dates.
In consideration for the rights licensed under the MEEI Agreement, Helio Vision issued MEEI a number of shares of its preferred stock and Helio Vision agreed to pay non-creditable non-refundable license maintenance fees to MEEI of $15,000 on each of the second and third anniversary of the MEEI Agreement, $25,000 on each of the fourth and fifth anniversary of the MEEI Agreement and $35,000 on the sixth and each subsequent anniversary of the MEEI Agreement during the term of such agreement. In addition, Helio Vision was obligated to make future sales-dependent milestone payments to MEEI of up to the low seven figures in the aggregate, as well as royalty payments to MEEI at a rate which, as a percentage of net sales, is in the low single digits for products that incorporate or use the MEEI Patent Rights in the United States and as a percentage in the low single digits for products that incorporate or use the MEEI Patent Rights outside the United States. We are also obligated under the MEEI Agreement to pay MEEI a percentage of certain sublicense revenue that we receive in connection with entering into any sublicensing arrangements with any third parties, at a percentage rate which tiers downward from low-double digits to mid-single digits based on the date of the sublicense. Following our acquisition of Helio Vision, we became obligated to make any future payments owed under the MEEI Agreement. There is no additional equity consideration issuable under the MEEI Agreement.
The MEEI Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration date of the last to expire patent licensed under the MEEI Agreement. We may terminate the MEEI Agreement with timely written notice to MEEI. MEEI has the right to terminate the MEEI Agreement if we, subject to certain specified cure periods, cease all business operations with respect to licensed products, fail to pay amounts due under the MEEI Agreement, fail to comply with certain due diligence obligations, default in our obligation to maintain insurance, one of our officers is convicted of a felony
relating to the manufacture, use, sale or importation of licensed products, we materially breach any provisions of the MEEI Agreement or in the event of our insolvency or bankruptcy.
In the event of an early termination of the MEEI Agreement, all rights licensed and developed by us under the MEEI Agreement may revert back to MEEI. We have agreed to indemnify MEEI for certain claims that may arise under the MEEI Agreement.
Our Acquisition of Helio Vision, Inc.
On January 28, 2019, we acquired Helio. Upon the closing of the acquisition, we issued an aggregate of 1,160,444 shares of common stock to the former securityholders and an advisor of Helio. In January 2021, pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement, we issued an additional 246,562 shares of common stock to the former securityholders of Helio. Subject to the conditions of the acquisition agreement, we are contingently obligated to make additional payments to the former securityholders of Helio as follows: (a) $10.0 million of common stock following approval by the FDA of a new drug approval application for the prevention and/or treatment of PVR or a substantially similar label prior to the 10th anniversary of the closing date; and (b) $2.5 million of common stock following FDA of a new drug approval application for an indication (other than PVR or a substantially similar label) prior to the 12th anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall we be obligated to issue more than 5,248,885 shares of common stock in the aggregate. Additionally, in the event of certain change of control or divestitures by us, certain former convertible noteholders of Helio will be entitled to a tax gross-up payment in an amount not to exceed $1.0 million.
Research and development expenses
We expense all of our research and development expenses as they are incurred. Research and development costs that are paid in advance of performance are capitalized as a prepaid expense until incurred. Research and development expenses primarily include:
•non-clinical development, preclinical research, and clinical trial and regulatory-related costs;
•expenses incurred under agreements with sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials; and
•employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel, and stock-based compensation expense.
Substantially all of our research and development expenses to date have been incurred in connection with reproxalap. We expect our research and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we advance reproxalap and other compounds through preclinical and clinical development. The process of conducting clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. We are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of reproxalap and our other product candidates. Clinical development timelines, the probability of success, and development costs can differ materially from expectations. We may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for our product candidates.
The costs of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project owing to, but not limited to, the following:
•per patient trial costs;
•the number of sites included in the trials;
•the countries in which the trials are conducted;
•delays of, or other effects on, clinical trials resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or for other reasons;
•the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;
•the design of the trials;
•the cost of drug manufacturing;
•the number of patients that participate in the trials;
•the number of doses that patients receive;
•the costs of assay development, assays, or other assessment of clinical trial endpoints;
•the cost of vehicle or active comparative agents used in trials;
•the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;
•potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies;
•the duration of patient follow-up;
•the phase of development the product candidate is in; and
•the efficacy and safety profile of our product candidates.
Included in research and development are expenses associated with asset acquisitions. Assets purchased in an asset acquisition transaction are expensed as in-process research and development unless the assets acquired are deemed to have an alternative future use. Acquired in-process research and development payments are immediately expensed, and include upfront payments, as well as transaction fees and subsequent milestone payments. Development costs incurred after the asset acquisition are expensed as incurred.
We do not expect reproxalap or any of our other product candidates to be commercially available, if at all, before at least 2023.
General and administrative expenses
Our general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of employee-related expenses, including benefits and stock-based compensation for our full-time employees during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Other general and administrative expenses include professional fees for auditing, tax, and legal services, including patent related costs. We expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we expand our operating activities, continue to incur additional costs associated with being a publicly-traded company, and maintain compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements. These increases will likely include higher consulting costs, legal fees, accounting fees, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance premiums, and fees associated with investor relations.
Other income (expense)
Total other income (expense) consists primarily of interest income we earn on interest-bearing accounts, and interest expense incurred on our outstanding debt.
Comprehensive loss
Comprehensive loss is defined as the change in equity during a period from transactions and other events and/or circumstances from non-owner sources. For the year ended December 31, 2021, comprehensive loss is equal to our net loss of $57.8 million and no unrealized loss on marketable securities. For the year ended December 31, 2020, comprehensive loss is equal to our net loss of $37.6 million and a realized loss on marketable securities of $5.9 thousand.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (US GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the expenses during the reported periods. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various
other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in order to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations.
Accrued Research and Development Expenses
As part of the process of preparing financial statements, we are required to estimate and accrue research and development expenses. This process involves the following:
•communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost;
•estimating and accruing expenses in our financial statements as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at the time; and
•periodically confirming the accuracy of our estimates with selected service providers and making adjustments, if necessary.
Examples of estimated research and development expenses that we accrue include:
•fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical studies;
•fees paid to contract manufacturing organizations in connection with non-clinical development, preclinical research, and the production of clinical study materials; and
•professional service fees for consulting and related services.
We base our expense accruals related to non-clinical development, preclinical studies, and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with organizations/consultants that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts may depend on many factors, such as the successful enrollment of patients, site initiation, and the completion of clinical study milestones. Our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur, or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates. To date, we have not experienced significant changes in our estimates of accrued research and development expenses after a reporting period. However, due to the nature of estimates, we cannot assure you that we will not make changes to our estimates in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of our clinical trials and other research activities.
COVID-19
We are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence and spread of variants of COVID-19, on all aspects of our business, including how the pandemic continues to impact our employees, clinical trials, development programs, supply chain, and other aspects of our operations. For example, patient enrollment in our GUARD trial was negatively impacted as a result of limited clinical trial staffing at study sites and some patients electing to delay surgery. While the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material adverse effect on our reported results for the year ended December 31, 2021, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact that the pandemic may have on our business, future results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. The extent to which our operations may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the outbreak, including the emergence and spread of variants of COVID-19, and
actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak. Furthermore, the impact of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the effects of continued disruptions to and volatility in the financial markets remains unknown.
Other Information
Net Operating Loss Carryforwards
As of December 31, 2021, we had federal and state income tax net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $226.0 million and $219.0 million, respectively. Federal NOL carryforwards generated through December 31, 2017 and state NOL carryforwards will expire at various dates through 2041. Federal NOLs generated during the years ended December 31, 2018 and thereafter will carry forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2021, we had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $6.9 million and $1.6 million, respectively, which will expire at various dates through 2041. Additionally, as of December 31, 2021, we had a federal orphan drug tax credit carryforward of approximately $1.0 million that expires in 2041.
Future changes in federal and state tax laws pertaining to net operating loss carryforwards may also cause limitations or restrictions from us claiming such net operating losses. If the net operating loss carryforwards become unavailable to us or are fully utilized, our future taxable income will not be shielded from federal and state income taxation absent certain U.S. federal and state tax credits, and the funds otherwise available for general corporate purposes would be reduced.
Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs and certain other tax assets (tax attributes) to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders’ lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years). Transactions involving our common stock within the testing period, even those outside our control such as purchases or sales by investors, could result in an ownership change. A limitation on our ability to utilize some or all our NOLs or credits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. We believe, prior to December 31, 2020 that three ownership changes occurred since inception, and that a fourth ownership change was triggered during the year ended December 31, 2021. Management believes that its aggregate Section 382 limitation (including the additional limitation for recognized "built-in gains") is sufficient so that no current impairment of its pre-ownership change tax attributes is required. Any future ownership changes, including those resulting from our recent or future financing activities, may cause our existing tax attributes to have additional limitations.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recent accounting pronouncements which may be applicable to us are described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in the annual report on Form 10-K.
Results of Operations
We anticipate that our results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors, including the progress of our research and development efforts, the timing and outcome of clinical trials, and regulatory requirements. Our limited operating history makes predictions of future operations difficult or impossible. Since our inception, we have incurred significant losses.
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Net loss. Net loss for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $57.8 million and $37.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had total stockholders’ equity of $205.7 million. Losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in our clinical trials and other research and development programs, amortization costs of founders’ stock related to the acquisition of Helio in January 2019, and from our general and administrative expenses.
Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses were $44.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $24.7 million for the same period in 2020. The increase of $20.2 million is primarily related to an increase in our external research and development expenditures based on planned clinical activities, partially offset by decreases in personnel related costs and $1.2 million in non-cash compensation costs in 2020 related to a portion of a contingent milestone in the Helio agreement that was recognized at December 31, 2020 and was settled in the first quarter of 2021.
General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of approximately $1.3 million is primarily related to increases in legal expenses, insurance costs, and consulting fees.
Acquired in-process research and development expenses. Acquired in-process research and development expenses were nil for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $1.8 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020 of in-process research and development expenses was associated with the January 2019 acquisition of Helio. At December 31, 2020, a contingent milestone related to Helio was determined to be probable and estimable, and we recorded $1.8 million of acquired in-process research and development expense related to a portion of the non-cash compensation costs that occurred as a result of the contingent milestone, which was settled in the first quarter of 2021.
Other income (expense). Total other income (expense) was approximately ($1.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to ($1.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Total other income (expense), for both periods, was principally comprised of interest income and interest expense.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have funded our operations primarily from the sale of equity securities and convertible equity securities and borrowings under credit facilities. Since inception, we have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities and have devoted substantially all our efforts to research and development. At December 31, 2021, we had total stockholders’ equity of approximately $205.7 million and cash and cash equivalents of $229.8 million. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we had net loss of approximately $57.8 million. We expect to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future.
In December 2018, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement SM (2018 Jefferies Sales Agreement) with Jefferies LLC (Jefferies), as sales agent, pursuant to which we offered and sold, shares of our common stock for aggregate sales proceeds of $50.0 million from time to time through Jefferies. From January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, we sold, at a volume-weighted average price of $4.62, an aggregate of 9.4 million shares of common stock with net proceeds of $40.7 million after deducting commissions related to the 2018 Jefferies Sales Agreement and other offering costs. As of December 31, 2020, we had sold the maximum allowable amount and no further sales may be made under the 2018 Jefferies Sales Agreement.
In January 2021, we closed an underwritten public offering in which we sold an aggregate of 7.9 million shares of common stock at $9.50 per share. The net proceeds of the offering were approximately $70.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering expenses.
In March 2021, we entered into an Open Market Sales Agreement SM (2021 Jefferies Sales Agreement) with Jefferies, as sales agent, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time through Jefferies, shares of common stock providing for aggregate sales proceeds of up to $100.0 million. We have no obligation to sell any shares under the 2021 Jefferies Sales Agreement, and could at any time suspend solicitations and offers under the 2021 Jefferies Sales Agreement. No sales had been made pursuant to the 2021 Jefferies Sales Agreement as of December 31, 2021.
In May and June 2021, we sold an aggregate of 10.2 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $12.50 per share, in an underwritten public offering, for an aggregate gross cash purchase price of $127.8 million or proceeds of approximately $119.8 million after underwriters’ discount, commissions, and other offering expenses, which included the partial exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares.
In March 2019, we entered into the Hercules Credit Facility (Loan and Security Agreement), pursuant to which a term loan of up to an aggregate principal amount of $60.0 million may be made available to us. The Loan and Security Agreement provides for (i) an initial term loan advance of up to $5.0 million at our option, which expired unutilized on April 15, 2019; (ii) three additional term loan advances of up to $15.0 million each, at our option, available to us upon the occurrence of certain funding conditions prior to September 30, 2019 (2019 Tranche), March 31, 2020 (2020 Tranche), and March 31, 2021 (2021 Tranche); and (iii) a final additional term loan advance (Fourth Loan Tranche) of up to $10.0 million prior to December 31, 2021, at our option, subject to approval by Lender’s investment committee. We drew down the 2019 Tranche in full in September 2019 and the 2020 Tranche and the 2021 Tranche expired unutilized prior to us satisfying the funding conditions for such tranche. On April 20, 2021, we entered into the First Amendment (First Amendment) to Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules. The First Amendment among other things, (i) increased the Fourth Loan Tranche from $10.0 million to $20.0 million and extended the deadline for drawing down the Fourth Loan Tranche to July 1, 2022; (ii) lowered the variable per annum rate of interest on borrowings under the Loan and Security Agreement to the greater of (a) the Prime Rate plus 3.10% or (b) 8.60%; (iii) extended the expiration of the period in which interest-only payments on borrowings under the Loan and Security Agreement are required from May 1, 2021 to July 1, 2022; and (iv) following the satisfaction of certain conditions in April 2021, further extended the expiration of the interest-only period and the deadline for drawing down the Fourth Loan Tranche to May 1, 2023. As of December 31, 2021, we had not satisfied the funding conditions for the Fourth Loan Tranche.
The Loan and Security Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. Affirmative covenants include, among others, covenants requiring us to maintain our legal existence and governmental approvals, deliver certain financial reports, and maintain insurance coverage. Negative covenants include, among others: restrictions on transferring any part of our business or intellectual property; incurring additional indebtedness; engaging in mergers or acquisitions; paying dividends or making other distributions; making investments; and creating other liens on our assets, in each case subject to customary exceptions. As of December 31, 2021, $15.0 million was outstanding under the Hercules Credit Facility, and no additional amounts were available for borrowing.
Following the effective time of the First Amendment, an aggregate of $35.0 million, subject to the terms and conditions of the Loan and Security Agreement, may be made available to us for borrowing, $15.0 million of which was funded prior to the date of the First Amendment.
Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, as of December 31, 2021, will be sufficient to fund our currently projected operating expenses through the end of 2023, including potential NDA submissions; initial commercialization of reproxalap, if approved; and continued early and late-stage development of our product candidates in ocular and systemic immune-mediated diseases. We will need to secure additional funding in the future, from one or more equity or debt financings, collaborations, or other sources, in order to carry out all of our planned research and development activities, commercialize our product candidates, or conduct any substantial additional development requirements requested by the FDA. At this time, due to the risks inherent in the drug development process, we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued clinical development of reproxalap and our other product candidates. Subsequent trials initiated at a later date will cost considerably more, depending on the results of our prior clinical trials, and feedback from the FDA or other third parties. Accordingly, we will continue to require substantial additional capital to continue our clinical development and potential commercialization activities. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:
•the progress, costs, results, and timing of our clinical development program for reproxalap and our other product candidates, including our current and planned clinical trials;
•the need for, and the progress, costs, and results of, any additional clinical trials of reproxalap or our other product candidates that we may initiate based on the results of our planned clinical trials or discussions with the FDA, including any additional trials the FDA or other regulatory agencies may require evaluating the efficacy and safety of reproxalap and our other product candidates;
•the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical trial initiation and enrollment and other aspects of our business, results of operations, and financial position;
•the outcome, costs, and timing of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals from the FDA, and any similar regulatory agencies;
•the timing and costs associated with manufacturing reproxalap and our other product candidates for clinical trials and other studies and, if approved, for commercial sale;
•our need and ability to hire additional management, development, and scientific personnel;
•the cost to maintain, expand, and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with licensing, filing, prosecuting, defending, and enforcing of any patents or other intellectual property rights;
•the timing and costs associated with establishing sales and marketing infrastructure;
•market acceptance of reproxalap and our other product candidates;
•the costs of acquiring, licensing, or investing in additional businesses, products, product candidates, and technologies; and
•our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems.
We may need or desire to obtain additional capital to finance our operations through debt, equity, or alternative financing arrangements. We may also seek capital through collaborations or partnerships with other companies. The issuance of debt could require us to grant additional liens on certain of our assets that may limit our flexibility. If we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, the terms and prices for these financings may be much more favorable to the new investors than the terms obtained by our existing stockholders. These financings also may significantly dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders. In addition, the disruption in the capital markets caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could make any financing more challenging, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to reduce the scope of our future activities, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. There can be no assurance that any additional financing required in the future will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
We will continue to incur costs as a public company including, but not limited to, costs and expenses for directors fees; increased directors and officers insurance; investor relations fees; expenses for compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related to rules implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq, on which our common stock is listed; and various other costs. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Operating Activities. Net cash used in operating activities was $42.6 million in 2021, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $37.5 million in 2020. The primary use of cash was to fund our operations. The increase in the amount of cash used in operating activities for 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily due to the timing of payments for research and development expenses in both years and higher research and development expenses in 2021.
Investing Activities. Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities in 2021 was ($7.8) thousand, related primarily to purchases of fixed assets. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2020 of $29.0 million, related primarily to the sales and maturities of marketable securities partially offset by the purchase of marketable securities.
Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $194.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, related primarily to the January and May 2021 public offerings, under which we sold an aggregate of 18.1 million shares of our common stock with net proceeds of $189.8 million after deducting commissions and other offering costs. In addition, we received $4.6 million from the proceeds from the exercise of stock options during 2021. Net cash provided by financing activities of $41.9 million for year ended 2020, related primarily the 2018 Jefferies Sales Agreement, under which we sold an aggregate of 9.4 million shares of our common stock resulting in $40.7 million in net proceeds after deducting commissions and other offering costs, and proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. Through December 31, 2021, we have not entered into and did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial collaborations, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purpose.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments. We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.
