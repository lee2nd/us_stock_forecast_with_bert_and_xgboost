Item 7. MANAGEMENTâ€™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020
The following information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Revenues
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded royalty revenues of $673,329 compared to $1,365,360 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $692,031 or 51%. The royalty rate that Starco Brands is paid varies on a per product basis of wholesale sales of our branded and non-corporate owned licensed products. Revenues are from our marketing licensing agreements with TSG and other affiliated companies, for various products mentioned above.
The decrease in the current year is primarily due to reductions in sales of our Breathe Hand Sanitizer (launched in 2020) and cleaning sprays, partially offset by growth in sales of Kleen-out, Winona Popcorn Spray, and, beginning in November, initial sales of Whipshots. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Breathe cleaning and sanitizer products accounted for approximately 20% of total royalty revenue, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 where Breathe cleaning and sanitizer products accounted for approximately 80% of total royalty revenue.
We believe that the decrease in our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 is in part due to COVID-19. In 2020, especially in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for consumer goods, and in particular sanitizers, skyrocketed. During the three months ended June 30, 2020, we saw demand increase for our Winona Popcorn Spray, Breathe cleaning products and Breathe Hand Sanitizer. As the initial panic and hoarding of cleaning supplies dwindled during 2021, and the increasing availability of vaccines became widespread, many retailers in the US evaluated their inventories and determined that they had, for many product categories, and in particular sanitization supplies, had too much stock due to a reduction in consumer frenzy over those products. As a result, the Company experienced a slowdown in demand for both our Breathe cleaning products and Breathe Hand Sanitizer.
Operating Expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2021, compensation expense increased $100,300, or 54% to $285,837 compared to $185,537 for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increased consulting support and the impact of non-cash compensation to strategic advisors.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company incurred $460,363 in professional fees compared to $145,416 in the prior period, an increase of $314,947, or 217%. Professional fees are mainly for accounting, auditing and legal services associated with our quarterly filings as a public company and advisory and valuation services. The increase is primarily due to an increase in legal fees for intellectual property and licensing transactions related to the launch of Whipshots.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company incurred $2,217,730 in marketing, general and administrative expense as compared to $507,278 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $1,710,452, or 337%. The increase can be attributed primarily to spending on promotional content and marketing to support the launch of Whipshots.
We did not incur any significant COVID-19 related expenses during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Other income and expense
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had total other loss of $34,473 compared to other income of $16,157 for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had interest expense of $30,973 and a non-cash loss on assets of $3,500, without any offset from subleasing income or gains on extinguishment of debt. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded other income from subleasing its office space of $15,750 and a gain on extinguishment of debt of $37,580. This was offset by interest expense of $37,173.
Net loss
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a net loss of $2,325,074 as compared to a net income of $543,286 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease from net loss to net income is the result of the decrease in our revenue and the large increase in spending to support the launch of Whipshots.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $18,388,186 at December 31, 2021.
We netted $1,518,421 from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to $1,100,000 of loan advances from Ross Sklar, our CEO, $600,000 of equity investments from unaffiliated parties, and $52,822 of net advances to fund corporate insurance policies, less share repurchases of $65,700 and other repayment activity. This compared to a net $102,798 of financings primarily from related party advances for the year ended December 31, 2020. A majority of our financing activity consisted of payments to and from related parties.
We currently require monthly cash for operating expenses in excess of our revenue, but are approaching break-even. Operating expenses include items such as marketing and administrative costs, consultant compensation, insurance, legal and other professional fees, compliance and website maintenance.

On June 28, 2021, STCB executed an additional promissory note with Ross Sklar in the principal amount of $100,000 with the same terms as the January 24, 2020 note and a maturity date of June 28, 2023.

On December 13, 2021, STCB executed a fourth promissory note with Ross Sklar in the principal amount of $500,000 with the same terms as the prior notes and a maturity date of December 12, 2023. As of December 31, 2021, there was $1,200,000 of principal and $8,626 of accrued interest due on these notes.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, contingencies and taxes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We are subject to various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when management concludes that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted.
Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that an entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: (i) identification of the promised goods in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.
The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606 at contract inception, the Company reviews the contract to determine which performance obligations the Company must deliver and which of these performance obligations are distinct. The Company recognizes as revenues the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied.
The Company earns its revenue from the licensing agreements it has with TSG and Temperance, each a related party. The Company licenses the right for TSG to manufacture and sell certain Starco Brands products. The amount of the licensing revenue received varies depending upon the product and is determined beforehand in each agreement. The Company recognized its revenue only when it receives a report of sales made by TSG to a third party.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
