RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Working Capital
Cash Flows
Operating Revenues
During the year ended April 30, 2022, the Company recorded revenues of $719,998 compared to revenues of $48,520 during the year ended April 30, 2021. Revenues were derived from royalties earned from oil and gas interests and the increase is due to the fact that the fiscal 2022 represented the first full fiscal year of royalty revenues and the Company also increased its investment in additional royalty producing properties in order to generate additional royalty revenue income.
Operating Expenses and Net Loss
During the year ended April 30, 2022, the Company recorded operating expenses of $3,870,118 compared to $3,014,593 during the year ended April 30, 2021. The increase in operating expenses was due to increases in consulting fees of $300,278, project expenditures of $84,622, reclassification of depletion expenses of $50,185 and general and administrative fees of $747,449 due to an overall increase in operating activity as a result in an increase in investments in additional oil and gas royalty investments which resulted in an increase in day-to-day operating expenditures. The Company also saw an increase in depletion expense of $515,541 as a result of a full year of oil and gas royalty operations for the year and also due to an increase in the number of oil and gas royalty properties which increased the amount of depletion expense recorded during the year, and an increase in professional fees of $47,525 due to increase in costs related to the Company’s SEC filings as a result of the continued growth and investment in its operations which resulted in additional time and costs incurred for accounting, audit, and legal professional fees incurred by the Company. The increases were offset by a decrease in management fees of $204,000 as the Company did not issue any share-based compensation in the current year to management and officers of the Company, and a decrease of $661,764 in impairment of oil and gas properties as the market price of oil and natural gas increased in the current year compared to the prior year, which resulted in less likelihood of impairment loss of carrying value under the full cost method of accounting for the Company’s oil and natural gas operations.
Net loss for the year ended April 30, 2022 was $3,422,146 as compared with $3,315,000 during the year ended April 30, 2021. In addition to the increase in operating expenses, the Company recorded $40,000 of commitment fees and $236,748 of finance charges relating to the costs incurred for the Company’s debt financing including its Series A and C preferred stock, which was offset by expenditures incurred in fiscal 2021 that were not incurred in fiscal 2022 including $121,974 loss on the change in fair value of derivative liability relating to the fluctuation of fair value of the conversion feature embedded in convertible notes payable, and $366,057 in interest expense related to debt servicing costs with respect to outstanding convertible debentures during the year.
For the year ended April 30, 2022, the Company recorded a loss per share of $0.00 as compared with a loss per share of $0.03 per share for the year ended April 30, 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of April 30, 2022, the Company's total asset balance was $5,085,057, compared to $3,217,998 as at April 30, 2021 and the increase is a reflection of the Company’s continued focus and objective to increase the number and value of various oil and gas royalty projects. Overall, the Company increased its carrying value of oil and gas properties of $1,042,653, and property and equipment of $2,778,721 and was offset by a decrease in cash of $1,946,691 as the cash was used to acquire the various additional investments in land, equipment, and oil and gas royalty properties.
As of April 30, 2022, the Company had total liabilities of $1,474,482 compared with total liabilities of $562,242 as at April 30, 2021. The increase in total liabilities was due the recognition of $1,228,018 of warrant liabilities relating to the issuance of 125,043,566 share purchase warrants with respect to its Series C preferred stock offering, which was determined using the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model assuming an expected life of 5 years, volatility between 314-318%, risk free rate between 1.2-1.7% per annum, and no expected forfeitures or dividends. The increase was offset by decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $43,533 due to timing differences between when the invoices are received by the Company and when the Company initiates payment, as well as a decrease in convertible preferred Series B stock liability of $214,940 as these amounts were exercised by former management of the Company.
As of April 30, 2022, the Company had a working capital deficit of $1,157,272 compared with a working capital surplus of $1,723,019 as of April 30, 2021. The decrease in working capital was due to the fact that the Company recorded the fair value of $1,228,018 for the liability portion related to share purchase warrants that were issued to the warrant holder.
During the year ended April 30, 2022, the Company issued 451,550,000 common shares for net proceeds of $3,920,500, issued 15,030,769 common shares with a fair value of $214,940 related to conversion of Series A preferred stock, issuance of 19,200,000 common shares with a fair value of $194,690 for services, 4,000,000 common shares issued to settle accounts payable with a fair value of $40,000 and 6,500,000 common shares with a fair value of $74,750

The increase was due to an increase in operating activities during the year including the acquisition of oil and gas interests which resulted an increase in general and administrative and overhead costs, including consulting and management fees for the sourcing of oil and gas properties, and professional fees relating to drafting and reviewing legal documents relating to the acquisition of the oil and gas interests.

Evaluation of Ability to Maintain Current Level of Operations
In connection with preparing the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022, management evaluated whether there were conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raised substantial doubt about our ability to meet our obligations as they became due for the next twelve months from the date of issuance of our Fiscal 2022 consolidated financial statements. Management assessed that there were such conditions and events, including a history of recurring operating losses, negative cash flows from operating activities, the continued negative impact by the volatility of the global oil and gas markets, a strong U.S. dollar in certain markets making our products more expensive in such markets, the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and ongoing global geopolitical tensions. We incurred a net loss for the year ended April 30, 2022 of $3,422,146 as compared with $3,315,000 during the year ended April 30, 2021. In addition to the increase in operating expenses, the Company recorded $40,000 of commitment fees and $236,748 of finance charges relating to the costs incurred for the Company’s debt financing including its Series A and C preferred stock, which was offset by expenditures incurred in fiscal 2021 that were not incurred in fiscal 2022 including $121,974 loss on the change in fair value of derivative liability relating to the fluctuation of fair value of the conversion feature embedded in convertible notes payable, and $366,057 in interest expense related to debt servicing costs with respect to outstanding convertible debentures during the year.
Our ability to continue current operations and to execute on management’s plan is dependent on our ability to generate cash flows from operations. Management believes that we will continue to make progress on our path to profitability through increased revenue streams
We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive acquisitions and activities. During the year ended April 30, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of $3,422,146 and used cash of $1,150,005 for operating activities. As at April 30, 2022, the Company had a working capital deficit of $1,157,272 and an accumulated deficit of $14,258,891. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The audited financial statements included in this Form 10-K does not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
We may seek to raise funds by selling additional securities (through the at-the-market offering or otherwise) to the public or to selected investors or by obtaining debt financing. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially favorable terms or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities, the fully diluted ownership percentages of existing stockholders will be reduced. In addition, any equity or debt securities that we would issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock or preferred stock.
Based on our current operating plan, management anticipates that, given current working capital levels and current financial projections, including price increases, we will be able to meet our financial obligations as they become due over the next twelve months from the date of issuance of our Fiscal 2022 financial statements.
Depending on the timing of revenue recognition, our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned. The amount of capital that we will need in the future will require us to achieve significantly increased sales volume, which is dependent on many factors, including:
●
the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy;
●
the continuing impact from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine;
●
oil and gas prices; and
●
global supply
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Future Financings
We will continue to rely on equity sales of our common shares in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund planned acquisitions and exploration activities.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, we
evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
●Our revenue consists of royalty payments from mineral leases and oil and gas investments.
●We reclassified depletion expenses to conform the current period standards. The reclassification had no material impact on our audited consolidated financial statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
