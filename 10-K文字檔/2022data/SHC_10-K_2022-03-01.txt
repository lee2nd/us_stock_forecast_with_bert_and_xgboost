Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including the factors we describe in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
OVERVIEW
We are a leading global provider of mission-critical end-to-end sterilization solutions and lab testing and advisory services for the healthcare industry. We are driven by our mission: Safeguarding Global Health®. We provide end-to-end sterilization as well as microbiological and analytical lab testing and advisory services to help ensure that medical, pharmaceutical and food products are safe for healthcare practitioners, patients and consumers in the United States and around the world. Our customers include more than 40 of the top 50 medical device companies and nine of the top ten global pharmaceutical companies (based on revenue). Our services are an essential aspect of our customers’ manufacturing process and supply chains, helping to ensure sterilized medical products reach healthcare practitioners and patients. Most of these services are necessary for our customers to satisfy applicable government requirements. We give our customers confidence that their products meet regulatory, safety and effectiveness requirements. With our industry-recognized scientific and technological expertise, we help to ensure the safety of millions of patients and healthcare practitioners around the world every year. Across our 65 facilities worldwide, we have over 3,000 employees who are dedicated to safety and quality. We are a trusted partner to approximately 5,500 customers in over 50 countries.
We serve our customers throughout their product lifecycles, from product design to manufacturing and delivery, helping to ensure the sterility, effectiveness and safety of their products for the end user. We operate across two core businesses: sterilization services and lab services. Each of our businesses has a longstanding record and is a leader in its respective market, supported and connected by our core capabilities including deep end market, regulatory, technical and logistics expertise. The combination of Sterigenics, our terminal sterilization business, and Nordion, our Co-60 supply business, makes us the only vertically integrated global gamma sterilization provider in the sterilization industry. This provides us with additional insights and allows us to better serve our customers. For financial reporting purposes, our sterilization services business consists of two reportable segments, Sterigenics and Nordion, and our lab services business consists of one reportable segment, Nelson Labs.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded net revenues of $931.5 million, net income of $117.1 million, Adjusted Net Income of $245.8 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $481.2 million. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA are financial measures not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). For the definition of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures from net income (loss), please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”
TRENDS AND KEY FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
We expect that our performance and financial condition will continue to be driven by the key trends impacting our industries, customers and their end markets as outlined in Item 1, “Business”. In addition, we believe the following trends and key factors have underpinned our recent operating results and may continue to affect our performance and financial condition in future periods.
•Continue to drive organic growth. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we continued to drive organic growth through increasing utilization of our existing capacity and expanding our capacity and service offerings. In our Sterigenics business, we made strategic investments to expand capacity at existing facilities and build new facilities. In our Nordion business, we remain focused on developing new supply relationships and expanding our capabilities to source Co-60 from additional reactors. In our Nelson Labs business, we continue to expand capacity to meet demand for microbiological testing and extractables and leachables testing. We are making investments to expand our geographic reach, technical expertise and regulatory know-how to stay ahead of the dynamic and increasingly stringent
regulatory landscape in the healthcare industry. Nelson Labs and Sterigenics also launched an Expert Advisory Services organization designed to drive growth in our advisory services offering.
•Disciplined and strategic M&A activity. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed two business acquisitions that expanded our addressable market and enhanced our global capabilities and footprint. In March 2021, we acquired BioScience Laboratories, LLC based in Bozeman, Montana, bringing expertise in antimicrobial and virology testing to our Nelson Labs segment. On November 4, 2021 we acquired Regulatory Compliance Associates Inc. (“RCA”) headquartered in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin. RCA is an industry leader in providing life sciences consulting focused on quality, regulatory, and technical consulting for the pharmaceutical, medical device and combination device industries. RCA will expand and further strengthen the technical consulting and expert advisory capabilities of Nelson Labs. We are continuing to pursue strategic acquisitions to grow our footprint and expand our capabilities.
•Litigation related costs and exit activities. We are currently the subject of a series of tort lawsuits alleging personal injury by purported exposure to EO emitted by our facilities in Willowbrook, Illinois and Atlanta, Georgia. We are also the subject of litigation with local officials in Georgia to allow us to resume operations at our Atlanta EO facility. In addition, we are defendants in a lawsuit brought by the State of New Mexico Attorney General alleging that emissions of EO from our Santa Teresa facility constitute a public nuisance and materially contributed to increased health risks suffered by residents in the area. We deny these allegations and are vigorously defending against these claims. We expect that our litigation costs will increase during the pendency of these cases, particularly as the per occurrence limit of our environmental liability insurance was reached for the Willowbrook litigation in the second quarter of 2020 and as we prepare for the commencement of the first personal injury trials for the Willowbrook litigation currently scheduled to occur in 2022. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” and Note 20, “Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and 2019, we recorded costs of $45.7 million, $36.7 million and $11.2 million, respectively, representing professional fees related to litigation associated with our EO sterilization facilities and other related professional fees. On September 30, 2019, we announced plans to exit our EO sterilization operations in Willowbrook and recorded a fixed asset impairment and have continued to incur certain transitional costs during the closure process including lease costs, payroll and utility expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded costs of $2.3 million, $2.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, relating to the closure of our Willowbrook facility.
•Impacts of our IPO and other public company costs. We completed the initial public offering of our common stock in November 2020. The IPO generated net proceeds of $1.2 billion after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering costs. As a newly public company we incurred significant expenses during the year ended December 31, 2021 that we did not incur as a private company. Those costs include additional board fees and director and officer liability insurance expenses, as well as third-party and internal resources related to accounting, auditing, Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance, legal, and investor and public relations expenses. These costs are generally classified as Selling, General & Administrative (“SG&A”) expenses. Additionally, in connection with our IPO, we implemented the 2020 Plan (as previously defined in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”), a long-term equity incentive plan to align our equity compensation program with public company plans and practices. We expect to grant additional stock-based awards to employees under the 2020 Plan in the first quarter of 2022.
•Borrowings, financing costs and financial leverage. We paid $58.8 million of cash for interest on long-term debt for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $211.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. A combination of lower outstanding borrowings and reduced pricing on our debt resulted in this reduction of $152.5 million year over year. On January 20, 2021 we amended our Term Loan to reduce the interest rate spread over LIBOR from 4.50% to 2.75%, and the LIBOR floor from 1.00% to 0.50%. For 2021, the changes resulted in an effective reduction in current interest rates of 2.25%. Interest savings in 2021 were offset by cash and non-cash charges associated with the repricing amendment. On March 26, 2021, we amended our Revolving Credit Facility to reduce the interest rate spread over LIBOR applicable to revolving loans from 3.50% to 2.75%. In addition, on August 27, 2021, we redeemed in full all of the $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of the First Lien Notes.
In connection with this activity, we incurred total costs of $20.7 million, which includes the write-off of debt discounts and issuance costs and an early redemption premium. Based on the current principal balance of our long-term debt and current market interest rates, we expect cash interest in 2022 to be approximately $58.4 million.
•Foreign currency exchange rates. As a result of our global operations, we generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We translate the assets, liabilities, net revenues and expenses of all of our operations into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates, and therefore we experience gains and losses related to exchange rate fluctuations.
