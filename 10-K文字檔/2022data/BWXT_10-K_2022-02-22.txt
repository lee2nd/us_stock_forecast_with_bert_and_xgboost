Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Statements we make in the following discussion, which express a belief, expectation or intention, as well as those that are not historical fact, are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, could differ materially from those we express in the following discussion as a result of a variety of factors, including the risks and uncertainties we have referred to under the heading "Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements" in Item 1 and throughout Item 1A of this Report.
General
We are a leading supplier of nuclear components and fuel to the U.S. Government; provide technical, management and site services to support governments in the operation of complex facilities and environmental remediation activities; supply precision manufactured components, nuclear fuel and services for the commercial nuclear power industry; supply critical medical radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals; and develop nuclear technologies for a variety of applications, including medical radioisotopes, advanced nuclear power sources and advanced nuclear reactors. In general, we operate in capital-intensive industries and rely on large contracts for a substantial amount of our revenues. We operate in three reportable segments: Nuclear Operations Group, Nuclear Power Group and Nuclear Services Group. We are currently exploring growth strategies across our segments through strategic investments and acquisitions to expand and complement our existing businesses. We would expect to fund these opportunities with cash generated from operations or by raising additional capital through debt, equity or some combination thereof.
Outlook
Nuclear Operations Group
We expect the backlog of our Nuclear Operations Group segment of approximately $4,511 million at December 31, 2021 to produce revenues of approximately $1,573 million in 2022, not including any change orders or new contracts that may be awarded during the year.
The revenues of our Nuclear Operations Group segment are largely a function of defense spending by the U.S. Government. As a supplier of major nuclear components for certain U.S. Government programs, we are a significant participant in the defense industry and have not been negatively impacted by federal budget reductions to date. We believe many of our programs are well-aligned with national defense and other strategic priorities as we supply high-end equipment for submarines and aircraft carriers for the U.S. Navy. However, it is possible that reductions in federal government spending could have an adverse impact on the operating results and cash flows of this segment in the future.
We expect that orders for nuclear components will continue to be a significant part of backlog for the foreseeable future. In addition, the U.S. Navy issued its fiscal year 2022 long-range shipbuilding plan in June 2021, which maintains previous recommendations to increase the size of its fleet of ships to include additional submarines and aircraft carriers. While the current presidential administration may make further changes with its fiscal year 2023 budget submission, we have made additional capital expenditures and investments in personnel to meet this anticipated growth in demand and we expect to continue making such expenditures and investments.
Nuclear Power Group
We expect the backlog of our Nuclear Power Group segment of approximately $644 million at December 31, 2021 to produce revenues of approximately $260 million in 2022, not including any change orders or new contracts that may be awarded during the year. The revenues in this segment primarily depend on the demand and competitiveness of nuclear energy. The activity of this segment depends on the timing of maintenance and refueling outages, the cyclical nature of capital expenditures and major refurbishment and plant life extension projects, as well as the demand for nuclear fuel and fuel handling equipment primarily in the Canadian market, which could cause variability in our financial results.
Our Nuclear Power Group segment's offerings also include medical radioisotope products, radiopharmaceuticals and medical devices for use in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic treatments. The medical isotope business will be the platform from which we plan to launch our Molybdenum-99 product line and a number of future radioisotope-based imaging, diagnostic and therapeutic products.
Nuclear Services Group
A significant portion of this segment's operations is conducted through joint ventures, which typically earn fees, and we account for them following the equity method of accounting. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report for financial information on our equity method investments. As a result, this segment reports minimal backlog and revenues.
Given our specialized capabilities of full life-cycle management of special materials, facilities and technologies, we believe our Nuclear Services Group segment is well-positioned to participate in the continuing cleanup, operation and management of critical government-owned nuclear sites, laboratories and manufacturing complexes maintained by the DOE, NASA and other federal agencies. However, it is possible that reductions in federal government spending could have an adverse impact on the operating results and cash flows of this segment in the future.
This segment also specializes in the development of advanced technologies. The nature, timing and duration of any related contracts are dependent on the demand and funding availability for such technologies.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management's application of accounting policies. We believe the following are our most critical accounting policies that we apply in the preparation of our financial statements. These policies require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain, and the impact of these policies have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report for further discussion of significant accounting policies.
Contracts and Revenue Recognition
We generally recognize estimated contract revenue and resulting income over time based on the measurement of the extent of progress toward completion using total costs incurred as a percentage of the total estimated project costs for individual performance obligations. We review contract price and cost estimates periodically as the work progresses and reflect adjustments proportionate to the percentage-of-completion in income in the period when those estimates are revised. If a current estimate of total contract costs indicates a loss on a contract, the projected loss is recognized in full when determined. It is possible that current estimates could materially change for various reasons, including, but not limited to, fluctuations in forecasted labor productivity or steel and other raw material prices. We routinely review estimates related to our contracts, and revisions to profitability are reflected in the quarterly and annual earnings we report. In the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized net favorable changes in estimates related to long-term contracts that increased operating income by approximately $26.5 million, $42.8 million and $71.6 million, respectively.
Although we continually strive to improve our ability to estimate our contract costs and profitability, adjustments to overall contract costs due to unforeseen events could be significant in future periods. We recognize contract change orders or changes in scope of work in contract revenues, to the extent of costs incurred, when we believe collection is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We recognize income from claims when formally agreed with the customer. We regularly assess the collectability of contract revenues and receivables from customers.
Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefits
We utilize actuarial and other assumptions in calculating the cost and benefit obligations of our pension and postretirement benefits. The assumptions utilized in the determination of our cost and obligations include assumptions regarding discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, mortality and health care cost trends. The assumptions utilized represent our best estimates based on historical experience and other factors.
We calculate the majority of our pension costs under both financial accounting standards ("FAS") in accordance with GAAP and CAS in accordance with the FAR. We have prepared our consolidated financial statements and segment reporting disclosures utilizing pension costs calculated under FAS. Pension costs calculated under CAS are utilized as the basis for recovery of pension costs on our U.S. Government contracts. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our CAS
pension costs attributed to U.S. Government contracts totaled $29.0 million, $43.6 million and $46.7 million, respectively. The amount of recoverable CAS pension costs recognized as revenue on an annual basis may differ from the amounts noted above. See further discussion of our accounting for contracts and revenue recognition above and in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
Actual experience that differs from these assumptions or future changes in assumptions will affect our recognized benefit obligations and related costs. We immediately recognize net actuarial gains and losses in earnings in the fourth quarter as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Net actuarial gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension and postretirement benefit plans or when assumptions, which are revisited annually through our update of our actuarial valuations, change due to current market conditions or underlying demographic changes. The primary factors contributing to net actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value the obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets. The effect of changes in the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets assumptions in combination with the actual return on plan assets can result in significant changes in our estimated pension and postretirement benefit cost and our consolidated financial condition.
The following sensitivity analysis shows the impact of a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and return on plan assets on our FAS pension benefit plan obligations and expense for the year ended December 31, 2021:
(1)Excludes effect of annual mark to market adjustment.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Each year, we evaluate goodwill at each reporting unit to assess recoverability, and impairments, if any, are recognized in earnings. We perform a qualitative analysis when we believe that there is sufficient excess fair value over carrying value based on our most recent quantitative assessment, adjusted for relevant facts and circumstances that could affect fair value. Deterioration in macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance, share price decline or entity and reporting unit specific events could cause us to believe a qualitative test is no longer appropriate.
When we determine that it is appropriate to test goodwill for impairment utilizing a quantitative test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. We utilize both the income and market valuation approaches to provide inputs into the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units, which would be considered by market participants.
Under the income valuation approach, we employ a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit. This model requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions regarding future revenues, costs, margins, capital expenditures, changes in working capital, terminal year growth rate and cost of capital. Our cash flow models are based on our forecasted results for the applicable reporting units. Actual results could differ materially from our projections. Some assumptions, such as future revenues, costs and changes in working capital are company driven and could be affected by a loss of one or more significant contracts or customers, failure to control costs on certain contracts, a decline in U.S. Government funding or a decline in demand based on changing economic or regulatory conditions. Changes in external market conditions may affect certain other assumptions, such as the cost of capital. Market conditions can be volatile and are outside of our control.
Under the market valuation approach, we employ the guideline publicly traded company method, which indicates the fair value of the equity of each reporting unit by comparing it to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. After identifying and selecting guideline companies, we analyze their business and financial profiles for relative similarity. Factors such as size, growth, risk and profitability are analyzed and compared to each of our reporting units. Assumptions include the selection of our peer companies and use of market multiples, which could increase or decrease based on the profitability of our competitors and performance of their stock, which is often dependent on the performance of the stock market and general economy as a whole.
Adverse changes in the assumptions utilized in our impairment test could cause a reduction or elimination of excess fair value over carrying value, resulting in potential recognition of impairment. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to goodwill in the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value.
We completed our annual review of goodwill for each of our reporting units for the year ended December 31, 2021, which indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill. The fair value of our reporting units was substantially in excess of carrying value.
Each year, we evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets to assess recoverability, and impairments, if any, are recognized in earnings. We perform a qualitative assessment when testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment to determine whether events or circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used in determining fair value have occurred that indicate that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. Deterioration in macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, cost factors or overall financial performance could cause us to believe a qualitative test is no longer appropriate. When quantitative assessments are performed, we primarily utilize income-based valuation approaches. Under the income-based valuation approach, we employ a relief from royalty method of valuation. This method requires significant assumptions, including assumed royalty rate, future revenues and cost of capital. Assumptions related to operating performance, such as future revenues, could be affected by loss of a customer contract, a decline in U.S. Government funding or a decline in demand based on changing economic or regulatory conditions. Changes in external market conditions may affect certain other assumptions, such as the cost of capital. Market conditions can be volatile and are outside of our control.
Adverse changes in these assumptions utilized within our indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test could cause a reduction or elimination of excess fair value over carrying value, resulting in potential recognition of impairment.
We have completed our annual review of our indefinite-lived intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2021, which indicated that we had no impairment. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets was substantially in excess of carrying value.
Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Cleanup Costs
We accrue for future decommissioning of our nuclear facilities that will permit the release of these facilities to unrestricted use at the end of each facility's service life, which is a requirement of our licenses from the NRC and the CNSC. In estimating fair value, we use present value of cash flows expected to be incurred in settling our obligations. To the extent possible, we perform a marketplace assessment of the cost and timing of performing the retirement activities. We apply a credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate to our expected cash flows in our determination of fair value. Actual costs incurred to decommission our facilities may differ from the accreted liability. For environmental liabilities associated with assets that we no longer operate, we have accrued amounts based on the estimated costs of cleanup activities, net of the anticipated effect of any applicable cost-sharing arrangements. We adjust the estimated costs as further information develops or circumstances change. Given the long-lived nature of these facilities, we are required to estimate retirement costs that will be incurred in the future, which may extend up to 40 years at the time the asset retirement obligation is established. Due to the significance of the remaining useful life of these facilities, the timing of retirement and future costs for material components of the asset retirement obligations, such as labor and waste disposal fees, could differ from our estimates. An exception to this accounting treatment relates to the work we perform for two facilities for which the U.S. Government is obligated to pay substantially all the decommissioning costs.
COVID-19 Assessment
General
We continue to monitor COVID-19 and its impacts and potential impacts on our business. We have received notifications from the U.S. and Canadian governments designating BWXT as an essential business given our roles in national security, energy production and medical manufacturing. We continue to operate our facilities and have taken numerous precautions to mitigate exposure and protect the health and well-being of our workforce, including arranging for the vaccination of our workforce, where possible.
To date, we have experienced localized and episodic operational challenges as a result of employee illness, quarantines and social distancing protocols. Because developments related to the spread of COVID-19 and its impacts continue to change, it is difficult to predict any future impact at this time. We have experienced, and may experience further, disruptions to demand for certain of our products and services and our operations in the future as a result of, among other things, national, state, provincial or local government enforced quarantines, vaccine mandates and related labor issues, worker illness, absenteeism or attrition, supply chain disruptions and travel and other restrictions. For similar reasons, COVID-19 may also adversely impact
our supply chain and other manufacturers, which could delay our receipt of essential goods and services. Any number of these potential risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Government Assistance
On March 27, 2020, the U.S. Government enacted the CARES Act, which among other things, provided employers an option to defer payroll tax payments for a limited period. As of December 31, 2021, we have deferred $21.4 million of payroll taxes which are due in two equal installments by early January 2022 and 2023. Additionally, on April 11, 2020, the Canadian Government enacted the CEWS under the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan to prevent large layoffs and help employers offset a portion of their employee salaries and wages for a limited period. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized subsidies under the CEWS as offsets to operating expenses of $5.4 million and $20.4 million, respectively. The Canadian Government extended the CEWS to May 2022 with a number of modifications. These modifications significantly decreased the amount of claims for which we qualified when compared to the prior year.
See Item 1A of this Report for an additional discussion of risks of COVID-19 on our business.
Results of Operations - Years Ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019
Selected financial highlights are presented in the table below:
This section discusses our 2021 and 2020 results of operations and contains year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of our 2019 results and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Report can be found in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Consolidated Results of Operations
Consolidated revenues increased slightly to $2,124.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $2,123.5 million in 2020, due to an increase in our Nuclear Power Group segment revenues of $35.8 million, which was partially offset by decreases in revenues in our Nuclear Operations Group and Nuclear Services Group segments of $23.7 million and $13.0 million, respectively.
Consolidated operating income decreased $12.7 million to $345.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $358.6 million in 2020. Operating income in our Nuclear Operations Group and Other segments decreased by $17.4 million and $2.0 million, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by increases in our Nuclear Power Group and Nuclear Services Group segments of $0.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively. We also experienced lower Unallocated Corporate expenses of $4.7 million in 2021 when compared to the prior year.
Nuclear Operations Group
Revenues decreased by 1.4%, or $23.7 million, to $1,622.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $1,646.3 million in 2020. The decrease was primarily related to the timing of the procurement of certain long-lead materials when compared to the prior year, which was partially offset by additional volume in the manufacture of nuclear components for U.S. Government programs and additional volume in our naval nuclear fuel and downblending operations.
Operating income decreased $17.4 million to $308.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $326.0 million in 2020. The decrease was due to the operating income impact of the changes in revenue noted above as well as lower levels of net favorable contract adjustments recorded in the current year when compared to the prior year.
Nuclear Power Group
Revenues increased by 9.6%, or $35.8 million, to $407.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $371.3 million in 2020. The increase was primarily related to higher levels of in-plant inspection, maintenance and modification services totaling $26.2 million in addition to increases in revenues related to our nuclear fuel handling capabilities of $13.3 million. We also experienced higher levels of revenue in our fuel fabrication and medical radioisotopes businesses when compared to the prior year. These increases were partially offset by lower activity in our nuclear components business of $19.8 million, primarily associated with a major steam generator design and supply contract.
Operating income increased $0.6 million to $52.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $52.0 million in 2020, due to the operating income impact of the changes in revenues noted above as well as a $2.0 million gain resulting from the settlement of contingent consideration associated with the Precision Manufacturing acquisition. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the amount of wage subsidies we received under the CEWS to offset the effects of COVID-19 on our Canadian operations of $15.0 million when compared to the prior year.
Nuclear Services Group
Revenues decreased by 9.5%, or $13.0 million, to $123.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $136.5 million in 2020, primarily attributable to the divestiture of our U.S.-based commercial nuclear services business during the second quarter of 2020 and lower revenues at our Naval Reactors decommissioning and decontamination project. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in design and engineering work executed by our advanced technologies business, particularly in the space and defense markets.
Operating income increased $1.5 million to $27.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $26.4 million in 2020 due to higher site fee income, which was partially offset by the operating income impact associated with the changes in revenues noted above.
Other
Operating income decreased $2.0 million to a loss of $24.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a loss of $22.3 million in 2020, primarily due to an increase in costs associated with the commercialization of our medical radioisotope technology.
Unallocated Corporate
Unallocated corporate expenses decreased $4.7 million to $18.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $23.6 million in 2020, primarily due to a decrease in legal and consulting costs associated with due diligence activities in addition to a $2.6 million reserve related to a franchise tax audit of years prior to 2016, which was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Other Income (Expense)
During the year ended December 31, 2021, other income (expense) increased $46.2 million to a gain of $49.9 million compared to a gain of $3.6 million in 2020. A component of other income (expense) is net periodic benefit cost inclusive of mark to market adjustments due to our immediate recognition of net actuarial gains (losses) for our pension and postretirement benefit plans. Net periodic benefit cost resulted in an increase to other income of $61.3 million when compared to the prior year, caused by increased gains related to mark to market adjustments totaling $39.6 million. This increase was offset by an early redemption premium of $10.8 million and the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs totaling $4.2 million associated with the redemption of the Senior Notes due 2026, as defined below.
Provision for Income Taxes
For the year ended December 31, 2021, our provision for income taxes increased $6.4 million to $89.4 million, while income before provision for income taxes increased $33.5 million to $395.7 million when compared to the prior year. Our effective tax rate was 22.6% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 22.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were higher than the U.S. corporate income tax rate of 21% primarily due to state income taxes within the U.S. and the unfavorable rate differential associated with our Canadian earnings. These unfavorable rate impacts were partially offset by benefits recognized for excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments of $0.3 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report for further information on income taxes.
Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices
Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, using historical U.S. dollar accounting ("historical cost"). Statements based on historical cost, however, do not adequately reflect the cumulative effect of increasing costs and changes in the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar, especially during times of significant and continued inflation.
In order to minimize the negative impact of inflation on our operations, we attempt to cover the increased cost of anticipated changes in labor, material and service costs, either through an estimate of those changes, which we reflect in the original price, or through price escalation clauses in our contracts. However, there can be no assurance we will be able to cover all changes in cost using this strategy.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our overall liquidity position, which we generally define as our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents plus amounts available for borrowings under our credit facility, decreased by approximately $301.6 million to $347.7 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $649.3 million at December 31, 2020, primarily attributable to an increase in net borrowings of long-term debt to fund capital expansion projects and repurchases of common stock. We experienced net cash generated from operations in each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Typically, the fourth quarter has been the period of highest cash flows from operating activities because of the timing of payments received from the U.S. Government on accounts receivable retainages and cash dividends received from our joint ventures.
Credit Facility
On March 24, 2020, we entered into an Amendment No. 1 to Credit Agreement, which amended the Credit Agreement dated as of May 24, 2018 (as amended, the "Credit Facility") with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto. The Credit Facility provides for a $750 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"). All obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are scheduled to mature on March 24, 2025. The proceeds of loans under the Revolving Credit Facility are available for working capital needs, permitted acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.
The Credit Facility allows for additional parties to become lenders and, subject to certain conditions, for the increase of the commitments under the Credit Facility, subject to an aggregate maximum for all additional commitments of (1) the greater of (a) $250 million and (b) 65% of EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Facility, for the last four full fiscal quarters, plus (2) all voluntary prepayments of the Term Loans, plus (3) additional amounts provided the Company is in compliance with a pro forma first lien leverage ratio test of less than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00.
The Company's obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of the Company's present and future wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries. The Credit Facility is secured by first-priority liens on certain assets owned by the Company and its subsidiary guarantors (other than its subsidiaries comprising its Nuclear Operations Group segment and a portion of its Nuclear Services Group segment).
The Revolving Credit Facility requires interest payments on revolving loans on a periodic basis until maturity. We may prepay all loans under the Credit Facility at any time without premium or penalty (other than customary Eurocurrency breakage costs), subject to notice requirements.
The Credit Facility includes financial covenants that are tested on a quarterly basis, based on the rolling four-quarter period that ends on the last day of each fiscal quarter. The maximum permitted leverage ratio is 4.00 to 1.00, which may be increased to 4.50 to 1.00 for up to four consecutive fiscal quarters after a material acquisition. The minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio is 3.00 to 1.00. In addition, the Credit Facility contains various restrictive covenants, including with respect to debt, liens, investments, mergers, acquisitions, dividends, equity repurchases and asset sales. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all covenants set forth in the Credit Facility.
Outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at our option at either (1) the Eurocurrency rate plus a margin ranging from 1.0% to 1.75% per year or (2) the base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.0% to 0.75% per year. We are charged a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, and that fee ranges from 0.15% to 0.225% per year. Additionally, we are charged a letter of credit fee of between 1.0% and 1.75% per year with respect to the amount of each financial letter of credit issued under the Credit Facility, and a letter of credit fee of between 0.75% and 1.05% per year with respect to the amount of each performance letter of credit issued under the Credit Facility. The applicable margin for loans, the commitment fee and the letter of credit fees set forth above will vary quarterly based on our leverage ratio. Based on the leverage ratio applicable at December 31, 2021, the margin for Eurocurrency rate and base rate revolving loans was 1.50% and 0.50%, respectively, the letter of credit fee for financial letters of credit and performance letters of credit was 1.50% and 0.90%, respectively, and the commitment fee for the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility was 0.20%.
As of December 31, 2021, borrowings and letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility totaled $400.0 million and $36.2 million, respectively. As a result, as of December 31, 2021 we had $313.8 million available under the
Revolving Credit Facility for borrowings and to meet letter of credit requirements. As of December 31, 2021, the interest rate on outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility was 1.61%.
The Credit Facility generally includes customary events of default for a secured credit facility. Under the Credit Facility, (1) if an event of default relating to bankruptcy or other insolvency events occurs with respect to the Company, all related obligations will immediately become due and payable; (2) if any other event of default exists, the lenders will be permitted to accelerate the maturity of the related obligations outstanding; and (3) if any event of default exists, the lenders will be permitted to terminate their commitments thereunder and exercise other rights and remedies, including the commencement of foreclosure or other actions against the collateral.
If any default occurs under the Credit Facility, or if we are unable to make any of the representations and warranties in the Credit Facility, we will be unable to borrow funds or have letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility.
Senior Notes due 2026
We issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due 2026 (the "Senior Notes due 2026") pursuant to an indenture dated May 24, 2018, among the Company, certain of our subsidiaries, as guarantors, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. On July 15, 2021, using cash on hand and borrowings under the Credit Facility, we redeemed the Senior Notes due 2026 at a redemption price equal to 102.688% of the principal amount, resulting in an early redemption premium of $10.8 million and the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs totaling $4.2 million. These charges were recorded in our consolidated statement of income during the year ended December 31, 2021 as components of Other - net and Interest expense, respectively.
Senior Notes due 2028
We issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due 2028 (the "Senior Notes due 2028") pursuant to an indenture dated June 12, 2020 (the "2020 Indenture"), among the Company, certain of our subsidiaries, as guarantors, and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association (formerly known as U.S. Bank National Association) ("U.S. Bank"), as trustee. The Senior Notes due 2028 are guaranteed by each of the Company's present and future direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that is a guarantor under the Credit Facility.
Interest on the Senior Notes due 2028 is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on June 30 and December 30 of each year at a rate of 4.125% per annum. The Senior Notes due 2028 will mature on June 30, 2028.

Other Arrangements
We have posted surety bonds to support regulatory and contractual obligations for certain decommissioning responsibilities, projects and legal matters. We utilize bonding facilities to support such obligations, but the issuance of bonds under those facilities is typically at the surety's discretion, and the bonding facilities generally permit the surety, in its sole discretion, to terminate the facility or demand collateral. Although there can be no assurance that we will maintain our surety bonding capacity, we believe our current capacity is adequate to support our existing requirements for the next twelve months. In addition, these bonds generally indemnify the beneficiaries should we fail to perform our obligations under the applicable agreements. We, and certain of our subsidiaries, have jointly executed general agreements of indemnity in favor of surety underwriters relating to surety bonds those underwriters issue. As of December 31, 2021, bonds issued and outstanding under these arrangements totaled approximately $109.5 million.
Other
Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Investments
In the aggregate, our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents and investments decreased by $8.2 million to $53.1 million at December 31, 2021 from $61.4 million at December 31, 2020, primarily due to the items discussed below. Our domestic and foreign cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:
Our working capital increased by $70.2 million to $314.1 million at December 31, 2021 from $243.9 million at December 31, 2020, primarily attributable to changes in net contracts in progress and advance billings due to the timing of project cash flows and lower levels of incentive compensation recognized in the current year.
Our net cash provided by operating activities increased by $189.6 million to $386.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $196.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily attributable to the timing of project cash flows.
Our net cash used in investing activities increased by $39.3 million to $304.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $265.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in cash used in investing activities was
primarily attributable to an increase in purchases of property, plant and equipment of $56.0 million, offset by our acquisition of Precision Manufacturing for $15.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Our net cash used in financing activities increased by $115.2 million to $90.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $25.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to an increase in the repurchases of common stock of $203.8 million compared to the prior year and the change in bank overdrafts of $88.7 million in 2021. These increases in cash usage were partially offset by an increase in net borrowings of long-term debt of $275.2 million compared to the prior year.
At December 31, 2021, we had short-term and long-term investments with a fair value of $13.4 million. Our investment portfolio consists primarily of U.S. Government securities, corporate bonds and mutual funds.
Cash Requirements
We believe we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity, along with cash generated from operations and continued access to debt markets, to satisfy our cash requirements for the next 12 months and beyond.
Our cash requirements as of December 31, 2021 include the following contractual obligations:
Our contingent commitments under letters of credit and surety bonds currently outstanding expire as follows:
Other cash requirements include, among other things, capital expenditures, payment of dividends, repurchases of common stock, capital contributions for joint ventures and contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
Since 2017, we have made considerable investments in property, plant and equipment to support the growth of our Nuclear Operations Group and Nuclear Power Group segments. Significant projects included the expansion of Nuclear Operations Group facilities to support increased demand from the U.S. Government and the commercialization of our medical radioisotope technology in our Nuclear Power Group segment. We expect these heightened spending levels to begin to decline in 2022 as these capital expansion projects near completion.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid $79.7 million in dividends to holders of our common stock. The declaration and payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our business, legal and regulatory requirements and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.
In April 2021, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase an indeterminate number of shares of our common stock up to an aggregate market value of $500 million. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased $225.8 million in shares of our common stock under this and prior share repurchase authorizations. As of December 31, 2021, the total remaining share repurchase authorization was $417.6 million. See Item 5 of this Report for additional share repurchase information.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, one of our joint ventures was awarded a DOE contract, which we expect to transition in 2022. Over the next 12 months, we anticipate significant initial capital contributions related to this joint venture.
We expect cash requirements totaling approximately $13.7 million for contributions to our pension plans in 2022. In addition, we anticipate cash requirements totaling approximately $1.6 million for contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2022.
