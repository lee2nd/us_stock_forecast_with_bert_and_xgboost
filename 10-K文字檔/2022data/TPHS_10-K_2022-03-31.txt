Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion related to our consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A detailed discussion of the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 is not included herein and can be found in the Management's Discussion and Analysis section in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 31, 2021.
Overview
We are a real estate holding, investment, development and asset management company. Our largest asset is currently 77 Greenwich Street in Lower Manhattan (“77 Greenwich”), which is nearing completion of development as a mixed-use project consisting of a 90-unit residential condominium tower, retail space and a New York City elementary school. We also own a recently built 105-unit, 12-story multi-family property located at 237 11th Street in Brooklyn, New York (“237 11th”), and, through joint ventures, a 50% interest in a recently built 95-unit multi-family property known as The Berkley, located at 223 North 8th Street, Brooklyn, New York (“The Berkley) which is under contract for sale, and a 10% interest in a recently built 234-unit multi-family property located one block from The Berkley at 250 North 10th Street (“250 North 10th”). In addition we own a property occupied by retail tenants in Paramus, New Jersey. See Item 2. Properties above for a more detailed description of our properties. In addition to our real estate portfolio, we also control a variety of intellectual property assets focused on the consumer sector, a legacy of our predecessor, Syms Corp. (“Syms”). We also had approximately $247.5 million of federal net operating loss carry forwards (“NOLs”) at December 31, 2021, which can be used to reduce our future taxable income and capital gains.
We continue to evaluate new investment opportunities, with a focus on newly constructed multi-family properties in New York City as well as properties in close proximity to public transportation in the greater New York metropolitan area. We consider investment opportunities involving other types of properties and real estate related assets, as well as repurchases of our common stock, taking into account our cash position, liquidity requirements, and our ability to raise capital to finance our growth. In addition, we may selectively consider potential acquisition, development and fee-based opportunities, as well as disposition, sale or consolidation opportunities.
Impact of COVID-19
Our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 and resulting restrictions and such impact could continue to be material. The extent of the impact going forward will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be
predicted, including the severity and duration of the outbreak, in New York City in particular, the success of actions taken to contain or treat COVID-19, actions taken by governmental entities, companies and individuals in response to the pandemic and reactions to such actions, the impact on local and broader economic activity and capital markets from the COVID-19 pandemic and new information that emerges with respect to the foregoing and other aspects of COVID-19. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact the Company’s business, operations and financial results in the future will depend on numerous evolving factors that the Company is not able to predict at this time, including, but not limited to, the impact on sales of residential condominium units at 77 Greenwich, which has been material, and the impact on the timing for construction of 77 Greenwich; the impact on the timing of the 237 11th litigation due to backlog in the New York City court system and the slowdown in judicial proceedings, and the receipt of any payments we may receive in connection with the litigation; increased operating costs related to cleaning and disinfecting our properties; the effect of the pandemic on our tenants and their ability to make rental payments; the impact of decisions of the NYC Rent Guidelines Board on our ability to raise rents; our ability to raise capital in the form of equity, debt, asset sales or otherwise on acceptable terms or at all and our ability to enter into strategic or other transactions. These developments and events have and will continue to adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price, which has been and is anticipated to continue to be material, although in recent months we have seen indications of a recovery in the New York City real estate market and improvements in the financing markets, including our ability to successfully refinance our 237 11th mortgage loan in June 2021 and our 77 Greenwich construction facility in October 2021. See Note 1 - Business to our consolidated financial statements and Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
Vacancy rates for multi-family properties across all boroughs of New York City increased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the largest increases in Manhattan. The work from home phenomenon resulted in significant number of people moving out of urban areas to suburban areas. This drove a drop in rental rates and an increase in concessions resulting in lower net effective rents, primarily on new leases. In recent months, with the implementation of COVID-19 vaccination programs and companies encouraging employees to return to the office, more potential tenants are moving back into New York City, which has resulted in an increase in face rents and a reduction in concessions. New York State imposed a moratorium on tenant evictions in March 2020 which has been extended several times, and was in place until January 15, 2022. Rent collections at our properties have been strong and in line with pre-pandemic collection rates. Notwithstanding these broader market trends, signs of distress, including discounted sales prices and debt workouts, in the New York City investment market have been almost non-existent over the past year. Multi-family property sales transaction volumes increased in 2021 compared to 2020 and properties are being sold at record prices.
Transactions, Development and Other Activities During 2021
Continued Progress in Development of 77 Greenwich
As of December 31, 2021, all residential unit finishes were complete through the 34th floor and the 35th floor was prepped for wood flooring. We have received our TCOs for floors 11-30 and 32-34, the lobby, mechanical rooms and portions of the cellar and anticipate receiving TCOs for the balance of the development through completion of the project. The project was approximately 92% complete at December 31, 2021.
Other Activities
● In June 2021, we refinanced the senior loan on 237 11th with a $60.0 million loan from a new lender. Remediation work was completed as of December 31, 2021 and the property was 97.1% leased. We also signed a lease for the remaining retail space such that the retail space was 100% leased as of December 31, 2021. See Item 2. Properties above for additional information.
● In October 2021, we closed on a new $166.7 million inventory loan for 77 Greenwich and repaid the more expensive construction loan. The new loan has no sales pace or financial covenants for the first 18 months.
● Simultaneous with the closing of the inventory loan in October 2021, we closed on an increase of $22.0 million to our 77 Greenwich mezzanine loan with an affiliate of the lender under our Corporate Credit Facility and amended that facility.
● In October 2021, we completed a private placement and raised approximately $4.8 million.
● In December 2021, we completed a rights offering and raised approximately $1.7 million.
● As of December 31, 2021, we had closed on the sale of 14 residential condominium units at 77 Greenwich, at an aggregate gross sales price of $24.8 million, and as of March 31, 2022 we had closed on three additional residential condominium units at an aggregate gross sales price of $6.3 million. Other units are under contract that are expected to close in the coming months, as they are completed and TCOs are received, allowing for their occupancy. Units that closed during 2021were generally lower priced, smaller units on the building’s lower floors, many of which entered into contract during the height of the pandemic. These units were completed first and were covered by the initial TCOs. Getting these units under contract allowed us to obtain approval from the New York State Attorney General and therefore start the closing process on residential units. All proceeds from the sales of residential condominiums are applied first to repayment of our 77 Greenwich Mortgage Loan (as defined below) until it has been repaid in full.
Results of Operations
Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020
Rental revenues increased by approximately $1.6 million to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This consisted of an increase in rent revenues of approximately $1.6 million to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $911,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, partially offset by a decrease in tenant reimbursements of approximately $26,000 to $56,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $82,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in total revenues and its related components was due to higher occupancy, higher face rents and less rent concessions at 237 11th during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the progress made in remediating the construction related defects.
Other income increased by approximately $92,000 to $355,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $263,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 which consisted mainly of the forgiveness of our PPP Loan of $243,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by lower SCA construction supervision fees we recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021 in accordance with the revenue recognition policies effective after the closing on the sale of the school condominium to the SCA in April 2020.
In connection with the commencement of sales of residential condominium units at 77 Greenwich for the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded gross sales proceeds of approximately $24.8 million. Units that closed during 2021were generally lower priced, smaller units on the building’s lower floors, many of which entered into contract during the height of the pandemic. These units were completed first and were covered by the initial TCOs. Getting these units under contract allowed us to obtain approval from the New York State Attorney General and therefore start the closing process on residential units.
Property operating expenses decreased by approximately $757,000 to $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was principally due to reduced expenses associated with 237 11th, including approximately $3.7 million in lower costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 to repair the construction related defects and $220,000 less in other operating expenses. These reductions were partially offset by increases of $220,000 in leasing commissions incurred as more apartment units at 237 11th were leased as they became fully remediated, as well as increases in general advertising and marketing expenses of $2.9 million related to the sale of residential condominium units at 77 Greenwich, $2.4 million of which was an out-of-period adjustment from prior years. Property operating expenses consisted primarily of expenses incurred for utilities, payroll, COVID-19 related supplies and general operating expenses as well as repairs and maintenance and leasing commission at 237 11th as well as general advertising and marketing expenses.
Real estate tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $74,000 remained consistent with the year ended December 31, 2020 at $79,000.
General and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $463,000 to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately $422,000 related to stock-based compensation, $2.4 million related to payroll and payroll related expenses, $1.1 million related to other corporate expenses, including board fees, corporate office rent and insurance and $597,000 related to legal, accounting and other professional fees. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately $708,000 related to stock-based compensation, $2.5 million related to payroll and payroll related expenses, $980,000 related to other corporate expenses, including board fees, corporate office rent and insurance and $788,000 related to legal, accounting and other professional fees which included approximately $200,000 of legal fees to resolve a legacy Syms claim related to the multiemployer pension plan.
Pension related costs decreased by approximately $278,000 to $67,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $345,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. These costs represent professional fees and other periodic pension costs incurred in connection with the legacy Syms Pension Plan. See Note 8 - Pension Plan to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
In connection with the commencement of sales of residential condominium units at 77 Greenwich for the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded cost of sales of approximately $24.4 million, which consists of construction and capitalized operating costs that are allocated to the respective condominium units being sold.
Transaction related costs decreased by approximately $128,000 to $5,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $133,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. These costs represent professional fees and other costs incurred in connection with the underwriting and evaluation of potential acquisitions and investments for transactions that were not consummated, as well as costs for potential leases at our retail properties that were not consummated.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased modestly by approximately $96,000 to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, depreciation and amortization expense consisted of depreciation for 237 11th of approximately $1.7 million and the amortization of lease commissions, acquired in-place leases and warrants of approximately $1.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, depreciation and amortization expense consisted of depreciation for 237 11th of approximately $1.7 million and the amortization lease commissions, acquired in-place leases and warrants of approximately $1.1 million. The slight increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to amortization of warrants.
Gain on sale of condominium of $24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 consists of the sale of the school condominium to the SCA of $20.0 million and an additional gain of $4.2 million related to the recognition of our construction supervision fee. This gain was recorded upon the closing on the sale of the school condominium to the SCA in April 2020.
Equity in net loss from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased by approximately $1.0 million to $555,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Equity in net loss from unconsolidated joint ventures represents our 50% share in The Berkley and our 10% share in 250 North 10th. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our share of the loss is primarily comprised of operating income before depreciation of $1.7 million offset by depreciation and amortization of $1.5 million, interest expense of $745,000 and the change in the fair market value of the interest rate swap of $77,000. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our share of the loss was primarily comprised of operating income before depreciation of $1.8 million offset by depreciation and amortization of $2.6 million and interest expense of $800,000.
Unrealized gain on warrants decreased by approximately $892,000 to $73,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from a $965,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. This represents the change in the fair market valuation of the warrants due mainly to the change in our stock price on the measurement date.
Interest expense, net increased by approximately $1.6 million to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, there was approximately $21.2 million of gross interest expense incurred, $18.2 million of which was capitalized into real estate under development,
and $2,000 of interest income. For the year ended December 31, 2020, there was approximately $17.2 million of gross interest expense incurred, $15.7 million of which was capitalized, and $57,000 of interest income. The increase in gross interest expense was due to the larger and growing borrowings outstanding on the 77 Greenwich Construction Facility during the period, which was refinanced in October 2021, as well as new borrowings under the 77 Mortgage Loan, Corporate Credit Facility, Mezzanine Loan and secured line of credit as described in more detail in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section below.
Interest expense - amortization of deferred costs increased approximately $932,000 to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $202,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was principally due to deferred finance costs of $567,000 that were expensed in June 2021 due to the refinancing of the 237 11th Loan, as well as the amortization of finance costs for our loans and secured line of credit that were not capitalized as part of real estate under development.
We recorded $265,000 in tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $306,000 in tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Net loss attributable to common stockholders increased by approximately $23.0 million to $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from net income of $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of the changes discussed above, principally due to the gain on sale of the school condominium to the SCA in April 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
COVID-19 Pandemic, Management’s Plans and Liquidity
The COVID-19 pandemic and related matters, including government actions, shifts in residential consumer sentiment and changes to the broader and local economies, have had a significant adverse impact on our business. While we believe many of these trends will reverse and the New York City economy and residential real estate markets will continue the improvement seen to date in 2022, given our focus on New York City residential real estate, our business has been particularly impacted, and may continue to be, as described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although the impact of the pandemic has impeded the sale of residential condominium units at 77 Greenwich, the pace of signing contracts has increased in 2021, and we closed on 14 residential condominium units in 2021 and have closed on three additional residential condominium units as of March 31, 2022, and residents are moving into their respective units. Units sold during 2021 were smaller, lower floor units that went under contract and closed during the height of the pandemic. These units were completed first and were covered by the initial TCOs obtained. Getting these units under contract allowed us to obtain AG approval of our condominium plan and start closing on residential unit sales. However, we have a limited amount of unrestricted cash and liquidity available for working capital and our cash needs are variable under different circumstances. Although there are no assurances that any transactions will be completed on acceptable terms or at all, we are currently exploring pursuing a variety of capital raising and other transactions, including the sale of certain assets or interests in assets, capital raises through equity offerings, including our ATM Program, debt borrowings, refinancings, including refinancing the Paramus line of credit and property at 237 11th, and/or strategic transactions, in each case, with the goal of maximizing the value of the assets and attributes of the Company while balancing short-term liquidity constraints. In addition, The Berkley is under contract for sale for a price of $71,020,000, which is currently anticipated to close in April 2022.
We currently expect that our principal sources of funds to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements for working capital and funds for acquisition and development or redevelopment of properties, tenant improvements, leasing costs, and repayments of outstanding indebtedness will include some or all of the following:
(1) cash on hand;
(2) proceeds from new debt financings, increases to existing debt financings and/or other forms of secured or unsecured debt financing;
(3) proceeds from equity or equity-linked offerings, including rights offerings or convertible debt or equity or equity-linked securities issued in connection with debt financings;
(4) cash flow from operations; and
(5) net proceeds from divestitures of properties or interests in properties, including the sale of The Berkley by our joint venture.
Cash flow from operations is primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio, the net effective rental rates achieved on our leases, the collectability of rent, operating escalations and recoveries from our tenants and the level of operating and other costs.
As of December 31, 2021, we had total cash and restricted cash of $24.8 million, of which approximately $4.3 million was cash and cash equivalents and approximately $20.5 million was restricted cash. As of December 31, 2020, we had total cash and restricted cash of $16.1 million, of which approximately $6.5 million was cash and cash equivalents and approximately $9.6 million was restricted cash. Restricted cash represents amounts required to be restricted under our loan agreements, letters of credit (see Note 10 - Loans Payable and Secured Line of Credit to our consolidated financial statements for further information), deposits on residential condominium sales at 77 Greenwich and tenant related security deposits.
At this time, we believe our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, together with proceeds that may be raised from the sale of The Berkley, which is under contract, subject to usual closing conditions and currently anticipated to close in April 2022, planned refinancing of the Paramus line of credit, or sale of the Paramus property and sales of the larger, higher floor condominium units at 77 Greenwich will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs and projected capital and other expenditures associated with our operations over the next 12 months, and the Company has concluded that management’s current plan alleviates the substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Additionally, we continue to evaluate opportunities to raise capital through sales of equity, including under our ATM program, debt issuances or refinancings, including refinancing the property located at 237 11th Street, and continue to evaluate dispositions of other properties or other assets and/or sales of partial interests in properties. Facts and circumstances could change in the future that are outside of management’s control, such as additional government mandates, health official orders, travel restrictions and extended business shutdowns due to COVID-19, and the impact of such matters on residential sentiment in New York City in particular.
Corporate Credit Facility
In December 2019, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Corporate Credit Facility” or “CCF”) with an affiliate of a global institutional investment management firm as initial lender (the “CCF Lender”) and Trimont Real Estate Advisors, LLC, as administrative agent (the “Corporate Facility Administrative Agent”), pursuant to which the CCF Lender agreed to extend us credit in multiple draws aggregating $70.0 million, which provided for an increase by $25.0 million subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and the consent of the CCF Lender. Draws under the Corporate Credit Facility were originally permitted to be made during the 32-month period following the closing date of the CCF (the “Closing Date”). The CCF matures on December 19, 2024, subject to extensions until December 19, 2025 and June 19, 2026, respectively, under certain circumstances. The CCF provided for the proceeds of the Corporate Credit Facility to be used for investments in certain multi-family apartment buildings in the greater New York City area and certain non-residential real estate investments approved by the CCF Lender in its reasonable discretion, as well as in connection with certain property recapitalizations and in specified amounts for general corporate purposes and working capital. The CCF bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) 5.25% and (ii) a scheduled interest rate (the “Cash Pay Interest Rate”) based on six-month periods from the Closing Date, which Cash Pay Interest Rate, from the Closing Date until the six-month anniversary of the Closing Date initially equaled 4.0% and increases by 125 basis points in each succeeding six-month period, subject to increase during the extension periods. A $2.45 million commitment fee was payable 50% on the initial draw and 50% as amounts under the CCF are drawn, with any remaining balance due on the last date of the draw period, and a 1.0% exit fee is payable in respect of CCF repayments. As of December 31, 2021, we had paid $1.85 million of the commitment fee. The CCF may be prepaid at any time subject to a prepayment premium on the portion of the CCF being repaid.
At December 31, 2021, the Corporate Credit Facility had an outstanding balance of $35.75 million, excluding deferred finance fees of $2.9 million, and an effective interest rate of 9.63%. Accrued interest totaled approximately $3.8 million at December 31, 2021, which included approximately $413,000 of interest that was paid the first week of January 2022. See Note 10 - Loans Payable and Secured Line of Credit to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
In connection with the December 2020 transaction noted below, the Company entered into an amendment to the Corporate Credit Facility (the “Corporate Facility Amendment”) pursuant to which, among other things, (i) the CCF Lender and the Corporate Facility Administrative Agent permitted the Company to enter into the Mezzanine Loan Agreement (as defined below), the amendment to the 77 Greenwich Construction Facility and related documents, (ii) the commitment made by the CCF Lender under the Corporate Credit Facility was reduced by the amount of the Mezzanine Loan (as defined below) from $70.0 million to $62.5 million, subject to increase by $25.0 million upon satisfaction of certain conditions and the consent of the CCF Lender, and (iii) the multiple on invested capital, or MOIC, amount that would be due and payable by the Company upon the final repayment of the loan pursuant to the Corporate Credit Facility if no event of default exists and is continuing under the Corporate Credit Facility at any time prior to December 22, 2022, was amended to combine the Corporate Credit Facility and the Mezzanine Loan for purposes of calculating the MOIC, to the extent not previously paid, if any. See Note 10 - Loans Payable and Secured Line of Credit to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
In connection with the closing of the 77 Mortgage Loan and amendment to the Mezzanine Loan described below, we entered into amendments, dated as of October 22, 2021 and November 10, 2021, to our CCF pursuant to which, among other things, the parties agreed that no additional funds will be drawn under the CCF, the minimum liquidity requirement was made consistent with the 77 Mortgage Loan Agreement until May 1, 2023 and the MOIC provisions were revised to provide that (i) the MOIC amount due upon final repayment of the CCF loan was amended to be consistent with the Mezzanine Loan such that if no event of default exists and is continuing under the CCF at any time prior to June 22, 2023, the amount due will be combined with the Mezzanine Loan, to the extent not previously paid, if any, and (ii) the amount of the CCF used to calculate the MOIC was reduced to $35.75 million.
In connection with the Corporate Credit Facility, we also entered into a warrant agreement with the CCF Lender pursuant to which we issued to the CCF Lender ten-year warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase up to 7,179,000 shares of our common stock. In connection with the Corporate Facility Amendment, the exercise price of the Warrants was amended from $6.50 per share to $4.31 per share, payable in cash or pursuant to a cashless exercise. See Note 11 - Stockholders Equity - Warrants to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the warrants.
As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all covenants of the CCF.
77 Greenwich Construction Facility
In December 2017, we closed on a $189.5 million construction facility for 77 Greenwich (the “77 Greenwich Construction Facility”). We drew down proceeds as costs related to the construction of the new mixed-use building were incurred. There was an outstanding balance of approximately $159.4 million on the 77 Greenwich Construction Facility at September 30, 2021. See Note 10 - Loans Payable and Secured Line of Credit to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. As a result of the refinancing transaction in October 2021, the 77 Greenwich Construction Facility was repaid in full.
77 Mortgage Loan
In October 2021, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours (the “Mortgage Borrower”) entered into a loan agreement with Macquarie PF Inc., a part of Macquarie Capital, the advisory, capital markets and principal investment arm of Macquarie Group, as lender and administrative agent (the “77 Mortgage Lender”), pursuant to which 77 Mortgage Lender agreed to extend credit to Mortgage Borrower in the amount of up to $166.7 million (the “77 Mortgage Loan”), subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions (the “77 Mortgage Loan Agreement”). The 77 Greenwich Construction Facility had an aggregate balance of $159.4 million at the time it was repaid in full at closing of the 77 Mortgage Loan. We borrowed $133.1 million on the closing date of the 77 Mortgage Loan and the balance of the funds used to repay the facility were obtained from an increase in the Mezzanine Loan, the Berkley Partner Loan as well as funds raised through the Private Placement. The $33.6 million remaining availability will be used to, among other things, complete construction of 77 Greenwich and fund carry costs while the residential condominium units are being sold.
The 77 Mortgage Loan has a two-year term with an option to extend for an additional year under certain circumstances and is secured by the Mortgage Borrower’s fee interest in 77 Greenwich. The 77 Mortgage Loan bears interest at a rate
per annum equal to the greater of (i) 7.00% in excess of LIBOR and (ii) 7.25%; provided that, if, on April 22, 2023, the outstanding principal balance of the 77 Mortgage Loan, together with any accrued and unpaid PIK Interest and unpaid Additional Unused Fee (as those terms are defined below) is equal to or greater than $91.0 million, the rate per annum will be equal to the greater of (i) 9.00% in excess of LIBOR and (ii) 9.25%. If cash flow from 77 Greenwich (including proceeds from the sales of residential units) is insufficient to pay interest payments when due, any accrued but unpaid interest will remain unpaid and interest will continue to accrue on such unpaid amounts (“PIK Interest”) until the cumulative PIK Interest and Additional Unused Fee accrues to $4.5 million (the “Threshold Amount”), after which all such amounts in excess of the Threshold Amount shall be paid in cash on a monthly basis until such amounts are less than the Threshold Amount. As advances of the 77 Mortgage Loan are made to Mortgage Borrower and the outstanding principle balance of the 77 Mortgage Loan increases, net proceeds from the sales of condominium units will be paid to 77 Mortgage Lender to reduce the outstanding balance of the 77 Mortgage Loan. A 1% per annum fee (the “Additional Unused Fee”) on a $3.0 million portion (the “Additional Amount”) of the 77 Mortgage Loan, is payable on a monthly basis on the undrawn portion of such Additional Amount. To the extent the 77 Mortgage Loan is not fully funded by October 22, 2022 (April 22, 2023 in the case of amounts with respect to construction work related to the new handicapped accessible subway entrance on Trinity Place), 77 Mortgage Lender may in its discretion force fund the remaining balance other than the Additional Amount into a reserve account held by 77 Mortgage Lender and disbursed in accordance with the terms of the 77 Mortgage Loan Agreement. The 77 Mortgage Loan is prepayable without penalty, subject to 77 Mortgage Lender receiving a minimum total return of $15.26 million, or if an advance has been made of the Additional Amount, the sum of $15.26 million, plus 10% of the Additional Amount that has been disbursed, in each case, inclusive of interest and fees, and must be prepaid in part in certain circumstances such as in the event of the sale of residential and retail condominium units. Mortgage Borrower is required to achieve completion of the construction work and the improvements for the Project on or before July 1, 2022, subject to certain exceptions. The 77 Mortgage Loan Agreement also includes additional customary affirmative and negative covenants for loans of this type, with the first sales pace covenant in April 2023.
In connection with the 77 Mortgage Loan Agreement, we entered into guarantees with the 77 Mortgage Lender pursuant to which we guaranteed the completion and payment of costs and expenses related to the construction; the payment of accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, costs, expenses and payments due and payable with respect to the 77 Mortgage Loan or 77 Greenwich; and the payment when due of all amounts due to 77 Mortgage Lender, as a result of “bad-boy” provisions. Mortgage Borrower and the Company also entered into an environmental compliance and indemnification undertaking for the benefit of 77 Mortgage Lender. Additionally, Mortgage Borrower is required to provide a letter of credit in an amount not less than $4.0 million. The letter of credit will be reduced to $3.0 million following, among other things, (x) final completion of the Project, subject to certain exceptions, and (y) paydown of the 77 Mortgage Loan to a basis of $625 per square feet of the unsold residential units.
As of December 31, 2021, the 77 Mortgage Loan had been paid down by approximately $8.9 million through closed sales of residential condominium units to a balance of $125.4 million and we had accrued $1.8 million in PIK interest, which is recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all covenants under the 77 Mortgage Loan.
Mezzanine Loan
In December 2020, we entered into a mezzanine loan agreement with an affiliate of the CCF Lender (the “Mezzanine Loan Agreement”, and the loan thereunder, the “Mezzanine Loan”). The Mezzanine Loan was originally for the amount of $7.5 million and has a term of three years with two one-year extension options, exercisable under certain circumstances. The collateral for the Mezzanine Loan was the borrower’s equity interest in its direct, wholly-owned subsidiary, which owns 100% of the equity interests in the borrower under the 77 Greenwich Construction Facility. The blended interest rate for the 77 Greenwich Construction Facility and the Mezzanine Loan, assuming the 77 Greenwich Construction Facility and the Mezzanine Loan are fully drawn, was 9.44% on an annual basis. Interest on the Mezzanine Loan is not payable on a monthly basis but instead is automatically added to the unpaid principal amount on a monthly basis (and therefore accrues interest) and is payable in full on the maturity date of the Mezzanine Loan. Upon final repayment of the Mezzanine Loan, a MOIC will be due on substantially the same terms as provided for in the CCF. The Mezzanine Loan may not be prepaid prior to prepayment in full of the 77 Greenwich Construction Facility, but if the 77 Greenwich Construction Facility is being prepaid in full, the Mezzanine Loan may be prepaid simultaneously therewith. Subject to the prior sentence the Mezzanine Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part, without penalty or premium (other than payment of the MOIC amount,
if applicable, as provided above), upon prior written notice to the lender under the Mezzanine Loan. In connection with the Mezzanine Loan, the Company entered into a completion guaranty, carry guaranty, equity funding guaranty, recourse guaranty and environmental indemnification undertaking substantially consistent with the Company’s existing guarantees made to the 77 Greenwich Lender in connection with the 77 Greenwich Construction Facility.
In October 2021, the Mezzanine Loan Agreement was amended and restated to, among other things, (i) increase the amount of the loan thereunder by approximately $22.77 million, of which $0.77 million reflects interest previously accrued under the original Mezzanine Loan, (ii) reflected the pledge of the equity interests in the Mortgage Borrower to the Mezzanine Lender as additional collateral for the Mezzanine Loan and (iii) conform certain of the covenants to those included in the 77 Mortgage Loan Agreement, as applicable. Additionally, the existing completion guaranty, carry guaranty, recourse guaranty and environmental indemnification executed in connection with the original Mezzanine Loan Agreement were amended to conform to the mortgage guarantees and mortgage environmental indemnity made in connection with the 77 Mortgage Loan (and the existing equity funding guaranty was terminated).
As of December 31, 2021, the Mezzanine Loan had a balance of $30.3 million and accrued interest totaled approximately $1.1 million. See Note 10 - Loans Payable and Secured Line of Credit to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Mezzanine Loan.
237 11th Loans
In May 2018, in connection with the acquisition of 237 11th, we entered into two-year interest-only financings with an aggregate principal amount of $67.8 million, which was comprised of a $52.4 million mortgage loan and a $15.4 million mezzanine loan bearing interest at a blended average rate of 3.72% over the 30-day LIBOR, each with a one-year extension option upon satisfaction of certain conditions. The mezzanine loan was repaid in full in February 2020. In June 2020, the maturity of the 237 11th mortgage loan was extended to June 2021 and amended to include a delayed draw facility of $4.25 million. In conjunction with the amendment, a LIBOR floor of 50 basis points was put in place, the spread was increased by 25 basis points to 2.25% and the exit fee was increased by 50 basis points to 1.0%. In June 2021, we repaid the 237 11th mortgage loan’s balance of $56.4 million in full and paid an exit fee of $567,000.
Simultaneously, in June 2021, in connection with the refinancing of the 237 11th mortgage loan, we entered into a $50.0 million senior loan (the “237 11th Senior Loan”) and a $10 million mezzanine loan (the “237 11th Mezz Loan” and together with the 237 11th Senior Loan, the “237 11th Loans”), provided by Natixis, bearing interest at a blended rate of 3.05% per annum. The 237 11th Loans have an initial term of two years and three one-year extension options. The first extension option is not subject to satisfaction of any financial tests. $1.5 million of the 237 11th Senior Loan proceeds were held back by Natixis to cover debt service and operating expense shortfalls, as well as leasing related costs. There was an outstanding balance of $48.7 million from the 237 11th Senior Loan and $10.0 million from the 237 11th Mezz Loan at December 31, 2021.
From time to time, properties that we own, acquire or develop may experience defects, including concealed defects, or damage due to natural causes, defective workmanship or other reasons. In these situations, we pursue our rights and remedies as appropriate with insurers, contractors, sellers and others. Due to certain construction defects at 237 11th that resulted in water penetration into the building and damage to certain apartment units and other property, which defects we believe were concealed and which would have required significant invasive work of a type not usually required or permitted, especially on a newly-built asset, to be detected, we submitted proofs of loss to our insurance carrier for property damage and business interruption (lost revenue) in March 2019. The insurance carrier subsequently disclaimed coverage for the losses and we filed a complaint against the carrier alleging that it breached the insurance policy by denying coverage. We also filed legal claims against the seller, its parent company, and the general contractor to recover damages arising from the defective construction. In addition, the general contractor has impleaded into that litigation several subcontractors who performed work on the property. Management expects to recover some portion of the cost incurred to repair the property through the litigations and/or settlement negotiations with the seller, its parent company, the general contractor, the subcontractors, and the insurance carrier, although the amount of damages that may be recoverable in litigation and/or potential settlement negotiations are uncertain at this time, as is the timing of receipt of any such payments, which has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resulting backlog in the court system and slowdown
in judicial proceedings. We have engaged in mediation with the seller, its parent company, the general contractor, and the third-party defendants impleaded by the general contractor to explore the possibility of settling the case involving those parties, but to date, have not reached an agreement. We incurred significant cash outflows for costs associated with these repairs and remediation, which commenced in September 2019. As of December 31, 2021, remediation work was complete. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we collected approximately 100% of rent due. As of December 31, 2021, the property was approximately 97.1% leased.
The Berkley Loan
We own a 50% interest in a joint venture formed to acquire and operate The Berkley, which is currently under contract for sale. In December 2016, the joint venture closed on the acquisition of The Berkley through a wholly-owned special purpose entity for a purchase price of $68.885 million, of which $42.5 million was financed through a 10-year loan (the “Berkeley Loan”) secured by The Berkley, and the balance was paid in cash, half of which was funded by us. On February 28, 2020, in connection with a refinancing, the Berkley Loan was repaid in full and it was replaced with a new 7-year, $33.0 million loan (the “New Berkley Loan”) which bears interest at a fixed rate of 2.717% and is interest only during the initial five years. It is pre-payable at any time and can be increased by up to $6.0 million under certain circumstances. We and our joint venture partner are joint and several recourse carve-out guarantors under the New Berkley Loan.
The Berkley Partner Loan
In October 2021, we entered into a loan agreement with our partner in The Berkley JV, pursuant to which our partner agreed to lend us up to $10.5 million principal amount, $500,000 of which is available only to be applied to interest payments, secured by our interest in the joint venture entity, maturing in one year, with two 12-month extension options subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. The loan bears interest at a rate of 10% per year, with a portion deferred until maturity. $10.0 million was funded at closing of the loan and is the balance of the loan at December 31, 2021.
Secured Line of Credit
Our $12.75 million secured line of credit with Webster Bank (formerly known as Sterling National Bank) is secured by the Paramus, New Jersey property. In March 2021, we entered into an amendment to extend the maturity date to March 2022, and in February 2022 it was extended to March 2023. The secured line of credit, which prior to the amendment, bore interest at 200 basis points over the 30-day LIBOR, now bears interest at the prime rate, currently 3.25%. The secured line of credit is pre-payable at any time without penalty. As of December 31, 2021, the secured line of credit had an outstanding balance of $12.75 million and an effective interest rate of 3.25%.
250 North 10th Note
We own a 10% interest in a joint venture with TF Cornerstone (the “250 North 10th JV”) formed to acquire and operate 250 North 10th, a recently built 234-unit apartment building in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York. On January 15, 2020, the 250 North 10th JV closed on the acquisition of the property through a wholly-owned special purpose entity for a purchase price of $137.75 million, of which $82.75 million was financed through a 15-year mortgage loan (the “250 North 10th Note”) secured by 250 North 10th and the balance was paid in cash. Our share of the equity totaling approximately $5.9 million was funded through a loan (the “Partner Loan”) from our joint venture partner. The Partner Loan bears interest at 7.0% and is prepayable any time within its four year term. Our partner has the option of having the Partner Loan repaid in our common stock if the price of our common stock exceeds $6.50 per share at the time of conversion. The non-recourse 250 North 10th Note bears interest at 3.39% for the duration of the loan term and has covenants, defaults, and a non-recourse carve out guaranty executed by us. We earned an acquisition fee at closing and are entitled to ongoing asset management fees and a promote upon the achievement of certain performance hurdles.
Private Placement Transaction and Rights Offering
On October 22, 2021, we entered into a private placement agreement with certain existing shareholders (“Investors”), pursuant to which we issued to the Investors an aggregate of 2,539,473 shares of our common stock at a price of $1.90 per share, and we received gross proceeds of $4.8 million, which closed on the same day.
On December 8, 2021, we closed on a common stock rights offering to existing shareholders at a price of $1.90 per share, which resulted in the issuance of 903,576 shares of our common stock and we received gross proceeds of $1.7 million.
At-The-Market Equity Offering Program
In August 2021, we entered into an "at-the-market" equity offering program (the “ATM Program”), to sell up to an aggregate of $10.0 million in shares of our common stock.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold 701,327 shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $1.4 million (excluding approximately $169,000 in professional and brokerage fees) at a weighted average price of $1.95 per share. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $8.6 million of our common stock remained available for issuance under the ATM Program.
Cash Flows
Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020
Net cash used in operating activities decreased by approximately $3.1 million to $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was mainly due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and pension liabilities of $2.3 million over the same period last year.
Net cash used in investing activities decreased by approximately $41.0 million to $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $55.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the $22.3 million in net proceeds from the closing on sales of residential condominium units at 77 Greenwich during 2021, as well as a reduction of $15.4 million in net additions to real estate this period compared to the same period last year. In addition, we contributed $5.4 million to our investment in The Berkley joint venture in connection with the pay-down of its mortgage during the year ended December 31, 2020. This was partially offset by a decrease of $2.0 of deferred real estate deposits on residential condominium units compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
Net cash provided by financing activities decreased by approximately $32.7 million to $30.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $62.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities primarily relates to the $134.3 million, $21.2 million, $58.7 million, $22.8 million, $10 million and $3.3 million in borrowings from the 77 Mortgage Loan, 77 Greenwich Construction Facility, the New 237 11th Loans, the Mezzanine Loan, the Berkley Partner Loan and the 237 11th Loan, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to borrowing $35.75 million, $42.1 million, $7.5 million, $5.0 million, $723,000 and $243,000 in proceeds from the Corporate Credit Facility, 77 Greenwich Construction Facility, the Mezzanine Loan, the Secured Line of Credit, the 237 11th Loan and the Paycheck Protection Program loan, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2020. This was partially offset by the payment of the 77 Greenwich Construction Facility of $160.3 million, 237 11th Loan of $56.4 million and the 77 Mortgage Loan of $8.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to repaying the $15.4 million 237 11th mezzanine loan, $8.0 million on the 77 Greenwich Construction Facility and $2.5 million on the Secured Line of Credit during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Material Cash Requirements
We estimate that for the year ending December 31, 2022, our cash requirements will be approximately $105,000 for capital expenditures and development or redevelopment expenditures (including tenant improvements and leasing commissions) on existing properties, other than for 77 Greenwich which will be funded under the 77 Mortgage Loan, including our portion of our two joint venture properties. We anticipate funding these capital expenditures through cash on hand and operating cash flow. We currently anticipate that the proceeds available under the 77 Mortgage Loan, together with equity funded by us to date, will be sufficient to complete the construction and development of 77 Greenwich without us making any further equity contributions. Future property acquisitions may require substantial capital investments for refurbishment and leasing costs.
Net Operating Losses
We believe that our U.S. federal NOLs as of the emergence date of the Syms bankruptcy were approximately $162.8 million and believe our U.S. federal NOLs as of December 31, 2021 were approximately $247.5 million. In connection with the conveyance of the school condominium to the SCA, we applied approximately $11.6 million of federal NOLs against taxable capital gains of approximately $18.5 million. Since 2009 through December 31, 2021, we have utilized approximately $23.8 million of the federal NOLs. Pursuant to the TCJA, corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) credit carryforwards are eligible for a 50% refund in tax years 2018 through 2020, and beginning in tax year 2021, any remaining AMT credit carryforwards are 100% refundable. As a result of these new rules, we had recorded a tax benefit and refund receivable of $3.1 million in 2017 in connection with our valuation allowance release. We received approximately $1.6 million of the refund receivable in October 2019, and the balance of approximately $1.5 million in July 2020.
On March 27, 2020, the “Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act” was signed into law. The CARES Act accelerated the ability of corporations to recover AMT credits, permitting a full refund for tax years 2018 and 2019. The CARES Act also included provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferral of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carrybacks and carryforwards, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations, increased limitations on qualified charitable contributions, and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. It also appropriated funds for the SBA Paycheck Protection Program loans that are forgivable in certain situations to promote continued employment, as well as Economic Injury Disaster Loans to provide liquidity to small businesses harmed by COVID-19. Management is monitoring the impact that the CARES Act may have on the Company. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows for fiscal years 2021 and 2020.
Based on management’s assessment, it is more likely than not that the entire deferred tax assets will not be realized by future taxable income or tax planning strategies. Accordingly, a valuation allowance of $66.6 million was recorded as of December 31, 2021.
We believe that certain of the transactions that occurred in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy in September 2012, including the rights offering and the redemption of the Syms shares owned by the former majority shareholder of Syms in accordance with the Plan, resulted in us undergoing an “ownership change,” as that term is used in Section 382 of the Code. However, while the analysis is complex and subject to subjective determinations and uncertainties, we believe that we should qualify for treatment under Section 382(l)(5) of the Code. As a result, we believe that our NOLs are not subject to an annual limitation under Section 382. However, if we were to undergo a subsequent ownership change in the future, our ability to utilize our NOLs could be subject to limitation under Section 382. In addition, the TCJA limited the deductibility of NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 to 80 percent of taxable income (computed without regard to the net operating loss deduction) for the taxable year. However, the CARES Act suspended the 80% limitation on the use of NOLs for tax years beginning before January 1, 2021, and allowed losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021 to be carried back up to five years.
Even if all of our regular U.S. federal income tax liability for a given year is reduced to zero by virtue of utilizing our NOLs, we may still be subject to state, local or other non-federal income taxes.
Our certificate of incorporation includes a provision intended to help preserve certain tax benefits primarily associated with our NOLs. This provision generally prohibits transfers of stock that would result in a person or group of persons becoming a 4.75% stockholder, or that would result in an increase or decrease in stock ownership by a person or group of persons that is an existing 4.75% stockholder.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in Note 2 - Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this report. Certain of the accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are particularly important for an understanding of the financial position and results of operations presented in the historical consolidated financial statements included in this report and require the application of significant judgment by management and, as a result, are subject to a degree of uncertainty.
Critical Accounting Policies
a. Real Estate - Real estate assets are stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. All costs related to the improvement or replacement of real estate properties are capitalized. Additions, renovations and improvements that enhance and/or extend the useful life of a property are also capitalized. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance, repairs and improvements that do not materially prolong the useful life of an asset are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as described in the table below:
b.
Real Estate Under Development - We capitalize certain costs related to the development and redevelopment of real estate including initial project acquisition costs, pre-construction costs and construction costs for each specific property. Additionally, we capitalize operating costs, interest, real estate taxes, insurance and compensation and related costs of personnel directly involved with the specific project related to real estate under development. Capitalization of these costs begin when the activities and related expenditures commence, and ceases when the property is held available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity at which time the project is placed in service and depreciation commences. Revenue earned under short-term license agreements at properties under development is offset against these capitalized costs.
c.
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets - We periodically review long-lived assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We consider relevant cash flow, management’s strategic plans and significant decreases, if any, in the market value of the asset and other available information in assessing whether the carrying value of the assets can be recovered. When such events occur, we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows, excluding interest charges, from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If this comparison indicates an impairment, the carrying amount would then be compared to the estimated fair value of the long-lived asset. An impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its estimated fair value. 77 Greenwich is a residential condominium development project currently in the development stage and management’s assessment for impairment indicators requires significant assumptions and estimates in relation to the status and progress of the development costs against budget, forecasting estimated costs to complete the project, estimated sales velocity and estimates of sales proceeds from the sale of completed condominiums. We considered all the aforementioned indicators of impairment for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. No provision for impairment was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2021 or 2020, respectively.
d.
Income Taxes - We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method as required by the provisions of ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which we do not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not.
ASC 740-10-65 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under ASC 740-10-65, we may recognize the tax benefit from an
uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. ASC 740-10-65 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and increased other disclosures. As of both December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had determined that no liabilities are required in connection with unrecognized tax positions. As of December 31, 2021, our tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2018 through December 31, 2021 are subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service. Our state returns are open to examination for the years December 31, 2017 or 2018 through December 31, 2021, depending on the jurisdiction.
e.
Revenue Recognition - Leases with tenants are accounted for as operating leases. Minimum rents are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective lease, beginning when the tenant takes possession of the space. The excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases are included in deferred rents receivable. In addition, retail leases typically provide for the reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance and other property operating expenses. As lessor, when reporting revenue, we have elected to combine the lease and non-lease components of our operating lease agreements and account for the components as a single lease component in accordance with ASC Topic 842. Lease revenues and reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance and other property operating expenses are presented in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income as “rental revenues.” Also, these reimbursements of expenses are recognized within revenue in the period the expenses are incurred. We assess the collectability of our accounts receivable related to tenant revenues. We applied the guidance under ASC 842 in assessing our lease payments: if collection of rents under specific operating leases is not probable, then we recognize the lesser of that lease’s rental income on a straight-line basis or cash received, plus variable rents as earned. Once this assessment is completed, we apply a general reserve, as provided under ASC 450-20, if applicable.
Revenues on sale of residential condominiums reflects the gross sales price and related profits from sales of residential condominium units are recognized at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the units are transferred to the buyer. Our performance obligation, to deliver the agreed-upon condominium, is generally satisfied in less than one year from the original contract date. Cash proceeds from unit closings held in escrow for our benefit are included in restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheets. Customer cash deposits on residential condominiums that are in contract are recorded as restricted cash and the related liability is recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets. Our cost of sales consists of allocated expenses related to the initial acquisition, demolition, construction and development of the condominium complex, including associated building costs, development fees, salaries, benefits, bonuses and share-based compensation expense, including other directly associated overhead costs, as well as qualifying interest and financing costs.
f.
Stock-Based Compensation - We have granted stock-based compensation, which is described below in Note 12 - Stock-Based Compensation. We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation-Stock Compensation,” which establishes accounting for stock-based awards exchanged for employee services and ASU No. 2018-07, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting,” which provides additional guidance related to share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods or services from non-employees. Under the provisions of ASC 718-10-35, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award on that date, and is expensed at the grant date (for the portion that vests immediately) or ratably over the related vesting periods.
