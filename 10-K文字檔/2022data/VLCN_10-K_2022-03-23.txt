ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
We are an all-electric, off-road powersports vehicle company developing and manufacturing electric two and four-wheel motorcycles and utility terrain vehicles (UTVs), also known as side-by-sides. In October 2020, we launched our offerings with two off-road motorcycles - the Grunt and the Runt. We initially began taking orders on our website for these initial offerings and began delivering the Grunts in the third quarter of 2021. Due to delays in development and the estimated cost to manufacture the Runt, we are still evaluating whether to manufacture and sell this product. We terminated our direct-to-consumer sales platform as of November 24, 2021, and as of that date, U.S. customers made deposits for 360 Grunts (net of cancellations), plus accessories and a delivery fee representing total deposits of $2.2 million. These orders are cancelable by the customer until the vehicle is delivered and after a 14-day acceptance period, therefore the deposits have been recorded as deferred revenue. We are assembling the Grunt in a leased production facilities in Round Rock, Texas. Based on our current production capacity, we believe we will deliver all of these orders by second quarter of 2022.
Beginning in November we began negotiating dealership agreements with retail partners to display and sell our vehicles and accessories. Customers will be able to buy our vehicles and accessories directly from a local dealership. Some of these retail partners will also provide warranty and repair services to our customers. Through December 31, 2021, we have entered into 33 dealership agreements.
We are designing an upgraded Grunt, the 2023 Grunt EVO, that will have a belt drive rather than a chain drive, an upgraded rear shock, a new seat and will be available in additional colors and have aftermarket accessory upgrades such as handlebars, grips, foot pegs and seats. The pricing for the 2023 Grunt EVO and accessories has not yet been determined. We expect the Grunt EVO to be available beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022.
We are also designing, and expect to introduce, the 2023 Grunt LE in the first quarter of 2023 which, like the Grunt EVO, will have a belt drive, but will also have a larger, integrated battery, black frame and additional color schemes along with other aftermarket upgrades. Pricing for the Grunt LE and related accessories have not yet determined. In addition, we are evaluating an additional model, 2023 Grunt XL (Hunt/Fish edition), and the features and release of this model has not been determined but would be focused on features attractive to hunters and anglers.
In the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect to begin selling the 2023 Volcon Brat E-Bike. Pricing for the Brat has not yet been determined and this will be manufactured by a third-party.
We expect to introduce the Volcon Stag in 2022 which we expect to be available for sale in the second half of 2023. The Stag will be followed with the introduction of a higher performance, longer range UTV (to be named) which we expect to be available for sale in 2024.
We have signed a lease for a dedicated, built-to-suit manufacturing facility on 53 acres in Liberty Hill, Texas, 25 miles northwest of downtown Austin from an entity controlled by our founders. We are evaluating an amendment to the lease that will provide additional tenant improvements and access to an additional 17 acres of land. If we agree to the amendment, we expect to begin production of the Stag, and possibly other vehicles, at this facility in the second half of 2023. We are also evaluating other options for facilities to lease to produce the Stag, including the possibility to fully outsource the manufacturing to a third-party.
We plan to sell our vehicles and accessories globally in a three-phase rollout of export sales- Latin America importers started in 2021, Canada and Europe expected in 2022 and Australia expected in 2023, subject to homologation requirements of each country, if any. Export sales are executed through individual importers in each country that buy vehicles by the container. Each importer will sell vehicles to local dealers or directly to customers. Local dealers will provide warranty and repair services for vehicles purchased in their country.
As of December 31, 2021, we have received orders from Latin America importers for 92 Grunts and delivered 24 of them. Payment for these orders is due prior to shipment and are cancelable until shipped. Based on our current production capacity, we believe we will be able to fulfill all pending orders by the second quarter of 2022.
Results of Operations
We were formed on February 21, 2020; therefor the financial information for 2020 is from the date of inception through December 31, 2020.
Due to recurring losses, there is no provision for income taxes for any period presented.
Revenue
Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $448,819 and represents the sale of 75 Grunts and accessories of $17,390. There were no sales during 2020.
Cost of goods sold
Cost of goods sold for year ended December 30, 2021, was $10,507,454. Costs include labor costs of $1,064,539 for employees and contractors performing parts purchasing, assembly and quality control testing of Grunts and stock-based compensation of $264,314 for share based awards for employees. Part costs for Grunts sold during the period was $1,489,649. Facilities costs were $148,683 for our manufacturing facility and inventory warehousing costs. Shipping costs for inventory purchases was $1,143,442. In addition, the Company recorded a write down of inventory of $5,450,007 to record inventory at its net realizable value.
In the next 6-9 months we could experience manufacturing delays due to shipping constraints in our supply chain. We expect cost of goods sold to increase as we sell higher quantities of Grunts, but we expect the cost per Grunt to decrease as we gain efficiencies in the manufacturing process and the cost of parts is reduced as we purchase in higher volumes and source additional suppliers.
Sales and marketing
Sales and marketing expenses relate to costs to increase exposure and awareness for our products and developing our network of U.S. dealers and international distributors. Sales and marketing expenses for the period ended December 30, 2020, were not significant as we did not have significant operations during this period.
Sales and marketing expenses were $2,872,620 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and were primarily related to expenses associated with promoting our products and brand of $1,260,800, professional fees of $412,429, primarily composed of legal fees of $161,398 to develop our dealer network and evaluate compliance with dealer laws across the United States and $92,888 for consulting fees related to the development of our international and domestic sales channels, employee payroll costs of $645,103, stock-based compensation of $313,718 for share-based awards granted to employees and consultants and $177,628 of facilities costs, primarily to operate our dealership in Denver, Colorado.
We expect sales and marketing expense to increase as we expand our U.S. dealer and international distributor networks and promote our products.
General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative expenses relate to costs for our finance, accounting and administrative functions to support the development, manufacturing and sales of our products. General and administrative expenses for the period ended December 31, 2020, were $833,277 and were primarily related to professional fees and related consulting, finance, accounting and legal costs in connection with establishing the Company and developing the future product development and sales plans. Payroll costs were not significant as the we only had 4 employees, all hired in the fourth quarter of 2020.
General and administrative expenses were $15,783,409 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and were primarily related to expenses associated with employee payroll costs of $679,147, stock-based compensation of $13,504,435 (consisting of $13,031,989 due to warrants issued to our founders in March 2021 and $472,446 due to share based awards granted to employees and consultants), professional fees of $804,703, including legal fees of $187,040, tax and accounting fees of $284,290, recruiting fees of $216,677 and IT consulting, outsourcing and other fees of $116,696 and insurance costs of $402,994.
We expect general and administrative expenses, other than stock-based compensation related to the founder warrants, to increase as we increase staffing to support sales, manufacturing, product development and to comply with public company reporting and compliance requirements.

We expect product development costs to increase in the future as our product development activities expand for new vehicle models.
Interest and Other Expenses
Interest expense for the period ended December 31, 2020 relates to interest on our note payable used to purchase a vehicle in December 2020. Interest and other expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily relates to interest on our notes payable used to purchase two vehicles and interest paid on the promissory notes issued in September 2021 and repaid in October 2021 with the proceeds from our initial public offering plus accretion of the discount on the issuance of the promissory notes.

Net loss for the period ended December 31, 2021 was $40,125,109, compared to $1,374,413 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
On December 31, 2021, we had cash of $5.6 million and we had working capital of $4.4 million. Since inception in February 2020, we have funded our operations from proceeds from debt and equity sales.
Cash used in operating activities
Operating activities for the period from February 21, 2020 (inception) to December 31, 2020, mainly included research and development costs, and professional fees for consultants and attorneys for the formation of the Company and early product development efforts. Some of these costs were paid for by the founders on behalf of the Company.
Net cash used in operating activities was $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and includes all of our operating costs except stock-based compensation, write down of inventory and prepaid inventory and depreciation and amortization. Cash used in operating activities includes increases in inventory and prepaid inventory totaling $8.2 million as we made payments and deposits to purchase raw materials to begin production of the Grunt in 2021 for delivery to customers, cash provided by customer deposits of $2.2 million and an increase in accounts payable of $1.4 million.

Cash used in investing activities for the period ended December 31, 2020, was not significant. Net cash used in investing activities was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and mainly included purchases of equipment and tooling related to the manufacturing of the Grunt.
Cash provided by financing activities
Cash provided from financing activities for the period ended December 31, 2020, was $1.9 million and was primarily related to proceeds received from the SAFE offering described below offset by net payments on related party notes payable.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $30.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
In January 2021, we completed a WeFunder SAFE offering which was convertible into preferred stock upon future financing events. We received gross proceeds of $2,258,940 and paid expenses of $53,500.
In February 2021, we completed an offering of our Series A preferred stock. We received gross proceeds of $2,669,978 and issued 415,287 shares of Series A preferred stock. We paid commissions and expenses of $205,470 and issued 79,750 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 79,750 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $2.57 to placement agents in connection with the offering. This equity financing resulted in the SAFE investments of $2.0 million as of December 31, 2020, converting into 424,269 shares of Series A preferred stock and the WeFunder SAFE investments converting into 351,832 shares of Series A preferred stock.
From April 2021 to September 2021, we sold 1,105,827 shares of Series B preferred stock at $9.50 per share resulting in gross proceeds of $10.5 million. We paid commissions and expenses of $890,026 and issued 123,295 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 197,272 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $3.80 to placement agents in connection with the offering.
On September 10, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with a lender for a 6% promissory note of $2 million. The promissory note has a maturity date of one year from inception or immediately upon the completion of this offering. For providing the above promissory note, the Company agreed to issue 266,664 shares of our common stock and agreed to pay $35,000 of the placement agent’s and investor’s legal costs and paid a 6% commission to the placement agent, who is the underwriter of this offering. Such payment is cash compensation for providing services for a private placement in accordance with FINRA Rule 5110 Supplementary Material .01(b)(2).
In October 2021, the Company completed its initial public offering and sold 3,251,875 shares of its common stock at $5.50 per share. The underwriter was also issued 162,594 warrants to purchase the Company’s common stock at $6.88 per share. The Company received net proceeds of $16.6 million after expenses of $2.9 million, including the fair value of the warrants issued to the underwriter.
Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain continued financial support from our stockholders, necessary equity financing to continue operations and the attainment of profitable operations. As of December 31, 2021, we had incurred an accumulated deficit of $41.5 million since inception and have generated less than $0.5 million in revenue. Additionally, management anticipates that our cash on hand as of December 31, 2021, plus the proceeds received from the offering of our common stock that closed in February 2022 is insufficient to fund planned operations, including the development of our vehicles, beyond one year from the date of the issuance of the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 30, 2021. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. We may be required to raise additional proceeds to fund our operations and there is no guarantee that we will be able to raise funding with favorable terms, if at all. Additionally, any equity issuance to raise additional proceeds during the 12 months following our February 2022 public offering would require the consent of our underwriter from our February 2022 offering.
JOBS Act Accounting Election
The recently enacted JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.
We have implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and may impact our financial statements and we do not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
Critical Accounting Policies
No critical accounting policies or estimates existed as of December 31, 2021.
