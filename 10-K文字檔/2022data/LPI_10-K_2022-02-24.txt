Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020, and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Additionally, see "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. The following discussion contains "forward-looking statements" that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the differences can be material. Please see "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and "Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors." Unless otherwise specified, references to "average sales price" refer to average sales price excluding the effects of our derivative transactions.
We are an independent energy company focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties, primarily in the Permian Basin of West Texas. Since our inception, we have grown primarily through our drilling program coupled with select strategic acquisitions and joint ventures.
Our financial and operating performance included the following for the periods presented and corresponding changes for such periods:
_____________________________________________________________________________
(1)Our oil, NGL and natural gas sales increased as a result of a 149% increase in average sales price per BOE and were partially offset by a 7% decrease in total volumes sold.
(2)Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes non-cash full cost ceiling impairments totaling $889.5 million.
(3)See pages 64-66 for discussion and calculations of these non-GAAP financial measures.
(4)See Note 19.d to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for discussion of changes in our estimated proved reserve quantities of oil, NGL and natural gas.
On October 18, 2021, we closed the Pioneer Acquisition, and issued 959,691 shares of our common stock constituting a portion of the purchase price. See Note 4.a to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional discussion of the Pioneer Acquisition.
On July 1, 2021, we closed the Sabalo/Shad Acquisition, and issued 2,506,964 shares of our common stock constituting a portion of the purchase price. On July 1, 2021, we also closed the Working Interest Sale. See Note 4.a to our consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional discussion of the Sabalo/Shad Acquisition and Working Interest Sale.
On July 16, 2021, we closed a private offering and sale of $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.750% senior unsecured notes due 2029. We received net proceeds from the offering of approximately $392.0 million (after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses), which were used for general corporate purposes, including, repaying a portion of the borrowings outstanding under our Senior Secured Credit Facility.
On January 14, 2022, we borrowed an additional $50.0 million and on January 31, 2022, we repaid $10.0 million on the Senior Secured Credit Facility. As a result, the outstanding balance under the Senior Secured Credit Facility was $145.0 million as of February 21, 2022. See Notes 7.d and 18.a to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional discussion of the Senior Secured Credit Facility.
Although much of the demand for oil and natural gas lost during COVID-19 has recovered, we are not able to predict the duration or ultimate impact that the pandemic will have on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We continue to closely monitor local infection rates and to conform to guidelines and best practices encouraged by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization and other governmental and regulatory authorities as we have implemented appropriate return-to-work policies while minimizing interruptions to our operations. To date, these measures have not had a material effect on our workforce productivity.
We maintain an active, multi-year commodity derivatives strategy to minimize commodity price volatility and support cash flows needed for operations. We are currently operating three drilling rigs and two completions crews. We expect to release one drilling rig and one completions crew by the end of first-quarter 2022 and maintain two drilling rigs and one completions crew for the remainder of 2022. Our planned capital expenditures for 2022 are expected to be approximately $520.0 million. However, we will continue to monitor commodity prices and service costs and adjust activity levels in order to proactively manage our cash flows and preserve liquidity.
Our results of operations are heavily influenced by oil, NGL and natural gas prices. Historically, commodity prices have experienced significant fluctuations; however, the volatility in the prices has substantially increased in recent years. Another collapse in commodity prices may affect the economic viability of, and our ability to fund our drilling projects, as well as the economic valuation and economic recovery of oil, NGL and natural gas reserves. See "Critical accounting estimates" for further discussion of our oil, NGL and natural gas reserve quantities and standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.
We have entered into a number of commodity derivative contracts that have enabled us to offset a portion of the changes in our cash flow caused by fluctuations in price and basis differentials for our sales of oil, NGL and natural gas, as discussed in "
