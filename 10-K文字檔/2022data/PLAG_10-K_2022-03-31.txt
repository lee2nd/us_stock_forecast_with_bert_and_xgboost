The accompanying audited consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. However, the Company has incurred a net loss of $9,740,486 attributable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Results of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company’s audited consolidated financial statement for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020 and related notes to that.
Net Revenues. Our net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 amounted to $37.77 million, which represents an increase of approximately $34.13 million, or 938%, from $3.64 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. This increase was attributable to the acquisition of certain subsidiaries and VIEs.
Cost of Revenues. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we experienced an increase in cost of revenue of $31.6 million or 1331%, in comparison to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, from approximately $2.37 million to $33.9 million. This increase was mainly due to the acquisition of certain subsidiaries and VIEs.
Gross Profit. Our gross profit increased by $2.58 million, or 203% to $3.85 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $1.27 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. This increase was mainly attributable to the acquisition of certain subsidiaries and VIEs.
Operating Expenses
Selling and Marketing Expenses. Our selling and marketing expenses increased by $1.89 million, or 1183%, to $2.05 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $0.16 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. This increase was mainly due to our effort to expand our business.
General and Administrative Expenses. We experienced an increase in general and administrative expense of $3.33 million from $3.90 million to approximately $7.22 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. This cost increase was mainly due to the increase of the professional service fees and expenses incurred by the newly acquired business operation.
Net Loss
Our net loss decreased by $1.06 million, or 10%, to a net loss of $9.99 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from $11.05 million in net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was mainly due to our effort to expand our business.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
In assessing our liquidity, we monitor and analyze our cash-on-hand and operating and capital expenditure commitments. Our liquidity needs meet our working capital requirements, operating expenses, and capital expenditure obligations. In the reporting period in the fiscal year 2021, our primary sources of financing have been cash generated from operations and private placements.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash) of $1.13 million compared to $3.42 million as of December 31, 2020. The debt to assets ratio was 40.41% and 16.65% as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. We expect to continue to finance our operations and working capital needs in 2021 from cash generated from operations and, if needed, private financings. Suppose available liquidity is insufficient to meet our operating and loan obligations as they come due. In that case, our plans include pursuing alternative financing arrangements or reducing expenditures as necessary to meet our cash requirements. However, there is no assurance that we will raise additional capital or reduce discretionary spending to provide liquidity if needed. We cannot be sure of the availability or terms of any alternative financing arrangements.
The following table provides detailed information about our net cash flow for all financial statement periods presented in this report.
