Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The liabilities of the Company exceed the reported value of its assets. Management’s efforts and activities have been, and continue to be, to sell assets of the Company to repay its indebtedness and to pay administrative expenditures in keeping an inactive company in existence. The aggregate remaining land inventory is less than 68 acres, consisting of multiple parcels located in two Florida counties. These parcels have limited value because of associated development constraints such as wetlands, easements and other obstacles to development and sale. At December 31, 2021 the carrying value of the land inventory was $10,000. The Company is seeking to realize full market value for such land. However, certain land parcels may be of so little value and marketability that the Company may elect not to pay the real estate taxes on selected parcels, which may eventually result in a de facto liquidation of such property by subjecting such property to a tax sale.
In management’s judgment, the assets will be insufficient to satisfy much, if any, of the outstanding indebtedness of the Company. Consequently, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a “going concern,” as that term is used for generally accepted accounting purposes. The asset carrying values shown in the financial statements, are judged to be reasonable estimates of the value, when viewed in the context of the entirety of the financial statements.
In early 2019, the Board of Directors of PGI concluded that PGI met and continues to meet all conditions under which a registrant may be deemed an “Inactive Entity” as that term is defined or contemplated in Rule 3-11 of Regulation S-X and as the term “Inactive Registrant” is further contemplated in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance’s Financial Reporting Manual section 1320.2. Under Rule 3-11 of Regulation S-X, the financial statements required thereunder with respect to an Inactive Registrant for purposes of reports pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including but not limited to annual reports on Form 10-K, may be unaudited. A representative of PGI informally discussed its view that PGI is an Inactive Registrant with a staff member of the Chief Accountant’s Office in the Division of Corporation Finance in February 2019.
As an Inactive Registrant, PGI currently intends to continue to timely file Annual Reports on Forms 10-K with the SEC, including this Form 10-K, as well as Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q and any other required reports. PGI currently intends to include in such Annual Reports all annual consolidated financial statements required to be included therein pursuant to Regulation S-X. The consolidated financial statements were audited prior to 2019 by BKD, LLP and a review was performed with respect to 2019 by Milhouse & Neal. However, due to its inactive status and diminishing financial resources, the aforementioned consolidated financial statements have not been reviewed or audited by a PCAOB registered public accounting firm for the year 2021 and 2020.
Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)
PGI meets all of the conditions in Rule 3-11 of Regulation S-X for an “Inactive Registrant” which are:
(a)
Gross receipts not in excess of $100,000;
(b)
Not purchasing or selling any of its own stock or granted options therefor;
(c)
Expenditures for all purposes not in excess of $100,000;
(d)
No material change in the business has occurred during the fiscal year;
(e)
No securities exchange or governmental authority having jurisdiction over the entity requires the entity to furnish audited financial statements.
PGI Has been a SEC registrant for over 40 years. As the Company reviews its circumstances, it has met the conditions as an Inactive Registrant since 2017.
The Company, formerly a Florida residential developer, is dormant with less than 68 acres of remaining landholdings, much of which has little value due to various restrictions. The Company’s consolidated financial statements show it has a Stockholders’ Deficiency of $95.1 million as of December 31, 2021. BKD, the Company’s PCAOB registered public accounting firm until the date the Company filed its Form 10-K for Fiscal 2018 which was February 25, 2019, expressed a “going concern” opinion with respect to the Company for its Fiscal 2018 financial statements and had expressed such opinions for many years previously. PGI has had no trading of its securities in many years. Any future real estate transactions by the Company will be limited, uncertain as to timing and as to value. Ultimately, PGI expects that proceeds from sales of its remaining real estate, if any, will provide some minimal recoveries for PGI’s senior debtholders.
The Company’s financial statement indebtedness includes its 6.0% subordinated convertible debentures which matured in May, 1992, with a remaining face amount of $8,025,000; and various notes payable, with a remaining face amount of $1,198,000.
The cumulative amount due for the 6% subordinated convertible debentures which matured in May 1992, includes the face amount of $8,025,000 plus accrued interest of $29,512,000 as of December 31, 2021. The subordinated convertible debentures have been in payment default for over twenty-five years. It is unclear whether any action on behalf of the bondholders is presently likely, given the negative net worth of the Company and continuing passage of time.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Revenues
Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $92,000 to $94,000 compared to revenues of $2,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of real estate sales of $90,000 in 2021. There were no sales of real estate in 2020. Other income increased by $2,000 to $4,000 compared to other income of $2,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Other income in 2021 represents income from a settlement claim from over 30 years ago when the Company was operating as a home builder. Other income in 2020 represents recoveries of lot lien receivables which had been fully provided for cancellation.
Costs and Expenses
Costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased by $399,000 when compared to the same period in 2020 as follows:
The cost of real estate sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $15,000 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, solely as a result of costs and expenses incurred in connection with sales of real estate in 2021. There was no such expense for the comparable period in 2020 because there were no sales of real estate during such period.
Interest expense relating to the Company’s current outstanding debt held by non-related parties, increased by $20,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest expense relating to the Company’s outstanding debt for subordinated convertible debentures, increased by $23,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of interest accruing on past due balances which increased at various intervals throughout the year for accrued but unpaid interest. This increase was offset by a $3,000 decrease in interest expense for notes payable due to a decrease in the average prime interest rate of 3.25% for 2021 compared to 3.54% for 2020.
Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)
The Company recognized $410,000 in forgiveness of debt and accrued interest during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Trustee of the 6.5% subordinated convertible debentures, which matured in June, 1991, provided notice of final distribution to the holders of such debentures on September 2, 2014. In connection with such final distribution, the Trustee designated the remaining balance of the debenture reserve fund held by the Trustee for final distribution of $92 per $1,000 in face amount to holders of such debentures who surrender their respective debenture certificates.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the remaining balance of the reserve fund of $13,000 was disbursed in escheatment to the states of the respective debenture holders. The remaining debentures with a face amount of $138,000 were surrendered with the escheatment of respective funds to the states of the debenture holders. Accordingly, the Company has recognized $125,000 in forgiveness of debt during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, accrued interest of $285,000 on such debentures that are considered surrendered was recorded as forgiveness of interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2020. There were no debentures surrendered or escheated in 2021.
Taxes and assessments were $5,000 during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Consulting and accounting expense was $24,000 and $34,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Accounting service fees paid to Love Real Estate Company (“LREC”), an affiliate of LIC, decreased by $10,000 in 2021 compared to 2020 due to a decrease in accounting services with the Company not being reviewed by a PCAOB registered public accounting firm effective with the March 31, 2020 periodic filing with the SEC. In addition, a quarterly consulting fee is paid to LREC of one-tenth of one percent of the carrying value of the Company’s assets.
Legal and professional expenses decreased by $35,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021 when compared to the same period in 2020 as follows:
Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)
General and administrative expenses decreased by $1,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to a decrease in the quarterly consulting fees paid to LREC. The Company pays LREC a quarterly consulting fee of one-tenth of one percent of the carrying value of the Company’s assets which have been consistently decreasing.
The net loss was $1,412,000 ($.39 per share loss) for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a net loss of $1,105,000 ($.33 per share loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020. Included in the 2021 and 2020 loss per share computation is $640,000 ($.12 per share of Common Stock) of annual cumulative preferred stock dividends in arrears.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Total assets decreased by $241,000 at December 31, 2021 compared to total assets at December 31, 2020 reflecting the following changes:
Net cash used in operating activities was $23,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to cash used in operations of $228,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net cash used in operations consists of cash received from operations less cash expended for operations.
Cash received from operations during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $94,000, which represents $90,000 from real estate sales and $4,000 in miscellaneous income from a settlement claim from when the Company was operating as a home builder. Cash received from operations in the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2,000, which represents miscellaneous income from a recovery of a lot lien receivable which had been fully provided for cancellation.
Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)
Cash expended for operations during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $117,000 which represents a decrease of $113,000 compared to cash expended for operations of $230,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020.
The decrease of $75,000 in payments of interest for accrued related party interest is a result of interest paid on collateralized debt of $50,000 in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $125,000 in 2020.
Liabilities were $95,149,000 at December 31, 2021 compared to $93,764,000 at December 31, 2020, reflecting the following changes:
Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased by $3,000 at December 31, 2021, compared to December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of timing differences.
Accrued real estate taxes increased by $1,000 at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 due to the accrual of penalties and interest on delinquent real estate taxes.
Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)
Accrued interest increased by $1,387,000 at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 reflecting changes in the following accrued interest categories:
The increase in accrued interest of $1,375,000 relating to the convertible subordinated debentures represents interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021. The accrued interest relating to convertible subordinated debentures increased due to the additional accrual of interest and no payment of previously accrued interest on the Company’s debentures (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8). The notes payable and convertible subordinated debentures, including accrued interest, are past due.
The decrease in accrued interest of $50,000 for the related party convertible debentures is due to the payment of accrued interest on the collateralized convertible debentures during the year ended December 31, 2021. The remaining balance of accrued interest on the collateralized convertible debentures is $52,740,000.
The increase of $62,000 of accrued interest relating to the Company’s other outstanding debt represents interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021. The notes payable and convertible subordinated debentures, including accrued interest, are past due.
The Company’s stockholders’ deficiency increased to $95,081,000 at December 31, 2021 from a $93,669,000 stockholders’ deficiency at December 31, 2020, reflecting the 2021 net loss of $1,412,000.

Forward Looking Statements
The discussion set forth in this Item 7, as well as other portions of this Form 10-K, may contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based upon the information currently available to management of the Company and management’s perception thereof as of the date of the Form 10-K. When used in this Form 10-K, words such as “anticipates,” “estimates,” “believes,” “appears”, “expects,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. Such state-ments are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results of the Company’s operations could materially differ from those forward-looking statements. The differences could be caused by a number of factors or combination of factors including, but not limited to: changes in the real estate market in Florida and the counties in which the Company owns any property; the overall national economy and financial markets; institution of legal action by the bondholders for collection of any amounts due under the subordinated convertible debentures (notwithstanding the Company’s belief that at least a portion of such actions might be barred under applicable statute of limitations); changes in management strategy; and other factors set forth in reports and other documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time.
