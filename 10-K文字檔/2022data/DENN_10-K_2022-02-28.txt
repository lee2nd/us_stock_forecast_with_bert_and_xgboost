Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto.
Overview
Denny’s restaurants are operated in 50 states, the District of Columbia, two U.S. territories and 11 foreign countries with principal concentrations in California (23% of total restaurants), Texas (12%) and Florida (8%). At December 29, 2021, the Denny’s brand consisted of 1,640 franchised, licensed and company restaurants. Of this amount, 1,575 of our restaurants were franchised or licensed, representing 96% of the total restaurants, and 65 were company restaurants.
Our revenues are derived primarily from two sales channels, which we operate as one segment: company restaurants and franchised and licensed restaurants. The primary sources of revenues are the sale of food and beverages at our company restaurants and the collection of royalties, advertising revenue, initial and other fees and occupancy revenue from restaurants operated by our franchisees under the Denny’s name. Sales and customer traffic at both company and franchised restaurants are affected by the success of our marketing campaigns, new product introductions, product quality enhancements, customer service, availability of off-premise dining options, and menu pricing, as well as external factors including competition, economic conditions affecting consumer spending and changes in guests’ tastes and preferences. Sales at company restaurants and royalty, advertising and fee income from franchised restaurants are also impacted by the opening of new restaurants, the closing of existing restaurants, the sale of company restaurants to franchisees and the acquisition of restaurants from franchisees.
Costs of company restaurant sales are exposed to volatility in two main areas: payroll and benefit costs and product costs. The volatility of payroll and benefit costs results primarily from changes in wage rates and increases in labor related expenses, such as medical benefit costs and workers’ compensation costs. Additionally, changes in guest counts and investments in store-level labor impact payroll and benefit costs as a percentage of sales. Many of the products sold in our restaurants are affected by commodity pricing and are, therefore, subject to price volatility. This volatility is caused by factors that are fundamentally outside of our control and are often unpredictable. In general, we purchase food products based on market prices or we set firm prices in purchase agreements with our vendors. In an inflationary commodity environment, our ability to lock in prices on certain key commodities is imperative to controlling food costs. In addition, our continued success with menu management helps us offer menu items that provide a compelling value to our customers while maintaining attractive product costs and profitability. Packaging costs and delivery fees (included as a component of other operating expenses) also fluctuate with changes in delivery and off-premise sales.
Our fiscal year ends on the last Wednesday in December. As a result, a fifty-third week is added to a fiscal year every five or six years. Fiscal 2021 and 2019 each included 52 weeks of operations, whereas 2020 included 53 weeks of operations. We estimate that the additional operating week added approximately $6.3 million of operating revenue in 2020.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
In an effort to provide greater transparency due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Denny's is providing the following tables that present monthly results for 2021:

Growing and Revitalizing the Brand
Over the last five years, our growth initiatives have led to 139 new restaurant openings. During 2021, our franchisees opened 20 restaurants, of which eight are international franchised locations, including five in Canada, and one each in Central America, Mexico, and the Philippines. Our goal is to increase net restaurant growth through both domestic and international avenues. Domestic growth will continue to focus on markets in which we have modest penetration. Development agreements related to the sale of 113 of our company restaurants during 2018 and 2019 and recently enhanced development agreements in Canada and the Philippines are expected to stimulate both domestic and international growth over the next several years.
A total of nine remodels were completed during 2021, consisting of five at franchised restaurants and four at company restaurants. One of these remodels was in our Heritage image, which we launched in late 2013. This updated look reflects a more contemporary diner feel to further reinforce our America’s Diner positioning. The remaining eight restaurants updated to our Heritage 2.0 image which features more attention-grabbing exterior elements while extending the relaxing interior elements from the original Heritage program. As of the end of 2021, approximately 90% of the restaurants in the system have been remodeled to one of our two Heritage images.
Balancing the Use of Cash
Though certain strategies have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are still focused long-term on balancing the use of cash between reinvesting in our base of company restaurants, growing and strengthening the brand and returning cash to shareholders. During 2021, cash capital expenditures were $7.4 million. Our real estate strategy is to redeploy proceeds from the sale of certain pieces of our owned real estate to acquire higher quality real estate underlying company and franchised restaurants. During 2021, the Company sold three parcels of real estate for approximately $50.1 million. Approximately $10.4 million of these proceeds were used to purchase real estate under three existing company restaurants through a series of like-kind exchange transactions.
As a result of refinancing our credit facility in the third quarter of 2021, we resumed our share repurchase program. During the third and fourth quarters of 2021, we repurchased a total of 2.0 million shares of our common stock for approximately $30.6 million. Since initiating our share repurchase program in November 2010 through fiscal year end December 29, 2021, we have repurchased a total of 56.0 million shares of our common stock for $584.6 million.
In December 2019, the Board approved a new share repurchase authorization for $250 million. As of December 29, 2021, there was approximately $217.4 million remaining under our current repurchase authorization.
Other Factors Impacting Comparability
For 2021, 2020 and 2019, the following items impacted the comparability of our results:
•Company restaurant sales decreased from $306.4 million in 2019 to $175.0 million in 2021, primarily from the impact of the sale of 113 company restaurants to franchisees during 2019 and 2018 and, in 2020 and 2021, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
•Royalty income, which is included as a component of franchise and license revenue, decreased from $108.8 million in 2019 to $67.5 million in 2020 primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. The subsequent increase to $103.4 million in 2021 was primarily due to our continuing recovery from the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on our business.
•Occupancy revenues, included as a component of franchise and license revenue, result from leasing or subleasing restaurants to franchisees. When restaurants are sold and leased or subleased to franchisees, the occupancy costs related to these restaurants move from costs of company restaurant sales to costs of franchise and license revenue to match the related occupancy revenue. Additionally, as leases or subleases with franchisees expire, franchise occupancy revenue and costs could decrease if franchisees enter into direct leases with landlords. Occupancy revenue has increased from $38.5 million in 2019 to $41.8 million in 2021 as a result of the sale of restaurants to franchisees, partially offset by the impact of lease expirations. At the end of 2021, we had 246 franchised restaurants that were leased or subleased from Denny’s, compared to 305 at the end of 2019.
______________
(1) Domestic system-wide same-store sales include sales at company restaurants and non-consolidated franchised and licensed restaurants that were open the same period in noted prior period. While we do not record franchise and licensed sales as revenue in our consolidated financial statements, we believe system-wide same-store sales information is useful to investors in understanding our financial performance, as our sales-based royalties are calculated based on a percentage of franchise sales. Accordingly, system-wide same-store sales should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, our results as reported under GAAP.
Statements of Operations
(a)Costs of company restaurant sales percentages are as a percentage of company restaurant sales. Costs of franchise and license revenue percentages are as a percentage of franchise and license revenue. All other percentages are as a percentage of total operating revenue.
(b)Equivalent units are calculated as the weighted average number of units outstanding during a defined time period.
(c)Same-store sales include sales from company restaurants or non-consolidated franchised and licensed restaurants that were open the same period in the prior year. While we do not record franchise and licensed sales as revenue in our consolidated financial statements, we believe domestic franchised same-store sales information is useful to investors in understanding our financial performance, as our sales-based royalties are calculated based on a percentage of franchise sales. Accordingly, domestic franchised same-store sales should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, our results as reported under GAAP.
(d)Prior year amounts have not been restated for 2021 comparable restaurants.
(e)In an effort to provide greater transparency due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are providing additional same-store sales information for 2021 that includes sales from company restaurants or non-consolidated franchised and licensed restaurants that were open the same period in fiscal 2019.
Unit Activity
Company Restaurant Operations
Company same-store sales increased 55.3% in 2021 and decreased 36.7% in 2020 compared with the respective prior year. Company restaurant sales for 2021 increased $56.9 million, or 48.1%, primarily resulting from the increase in company same-store sales caused primarily by reduced dine-in restrictions and fewer temporary closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Company restaurant sales for 2020 decreased $188.2 million, or 61.4%, primarily resulting from a 59 equivalent unit decrease in company restaurants and a 36.7% decrease in company same-store sales caused primarily by dine-in restrictions and temporary closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Total costs of company restaurant sales as a percentage of company restaurant sales were 84.0% in 2021, 97.0% in 2020 and 84.3% in 2019 consisting of the following:
Product costs were 24.6% in 2021, 25.2% in 2020 and 24.4% in 2019. For 2021, the decrease as a percentage of sales was primarily due to leverage gained from favorable product mix and increased pricing and lower paper costs, partly offset by higher commodity costs. For 2020, the increase as a percentage of sales was due to increases in paper products due to the increase in delivery and to-go orders related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Payroll and benefits were 37.3% in 2021, 43.7% in 2020 and 38.8% in 2019. The 2021 decrease as a percentage of sales was due to the leveraging effect of higher sales. The 2021 decrease included a 3.9 percentage point decrease in management labor, 1.7 percentage point decrease in team labor, and 0.5 percentage point decrease in workers’ compensation costs. The 2020 increase as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of sales deleveraging caused by lower sales resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 increase included a 3.2 percentage point increase in management labor, 0.8 percentage point increase in team labor, and 0.3 percentage point increase in fringe benefits.
Occupancy costs were 6.7% in 2021, 9.5% in 2020 and 6.1% in 2019. The 2021 decrease as a percentage of sales was due to the leveraging effect of higher sales. For 2020, the increase as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the sales deleveraging effect caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the impact of refranchising of restaurants during 2019 where we owned the real estate contributed to the rate increase.
Other operating expenses consisted of the following amounts and percentages of company restaurant sales:
For 2021, other direct costs were lower as a percentage of sales due to the leveraging effect of higher sales, partially offset by higher delivery fees and legal settlement costs. Other direct costs were higher as a percentage of sales for 2020 due to the deleveraging effect of lower sales as well as higher delivery costs due to the increase in delivery sales during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Franchise Operations
Franchise and license revenue and costs of franchise and license revenue consisted of the following amounts and percentages of franchise and license revenue for the periods indicated:
Royalties increased by $35.9 million, or 53.2%, in 2021 primarily resulting from a 40.1% increase in domestic franchised same-store sales as compared to the prior year. Additionally, the prior year included royalty abatements of $6.0 million to help our franchisees weather the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Royalties decreased by $41.3 million, or 38.0%, in 2020 primarily resulting from a 30.9% decrease in domestic franchised same-store sales and royalty abatements of $6.0 million. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of 36 equivalent units resulting from our refranchising and development strategy in 2019. The average domestic royalty rate, including the impact of abatements, was 4.35%, 3.86% and 4.22% for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Advertising revenue increased $16.2 million, or 30.2%, in 2021 resulting from the increase in domestic franchised same-store sales. Additionally, the prior year included advertising fee abatements of $1.3 million. Advertising revenue decreased $27.4 million, or 33.8%, in 2020 resulting from the decrease in domestic franchised same-store sales and $1.3 million of advertising fee abatements. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of 36 equivalent units resulting from our refranchising and development strategy in 2019.
Initial and other fees increased $0.7 million, or 9.2%, in 2021 primarily due to higher menu production revenue, partially offset by the impact of less accelerated revenue recognition as a result of fewer franchised unit closures compared to 2020. Initial and other fees increased $0.8 million, or 12.1%, in 2020 from the impact of higher accelerated revenue recognition as a result of higher franchised unit closures compared to 2019. This increase was offset by lower menu revenue resulting from fewer menu releases in 2020.
Occupancy revenue decreased $0.1 million, or 0.2%, in 2021 primarily due to lease terminations, partially offset by higher percentage rents as a result of sales increases. Occupancy revenue increased by $3.4 million, or 8.7%, in 2020 primarily resulting from additional leases and subleases to franchisees as a result of our refranchising and development strategy in 2019.
Costs of franchise and license revenue increased $14.8 million, or 15.7%, in 2021. The increase was primarily related to increased advertising costs, which corresponds to the related advertising revenue increases noted above. Occupancy costs decreased $0.5 million, or 1.9%, in 2021, primarily related to lease terminations. Other direct costs decreased $0.9 million, or 6.7%, primarily due to reductions in bad debt allowance expense, partially offset by increases in menu production expense. As a result, costs of franchise and license revenue as a percentage of franchise and license revenue decreased to 48.9% for 2021 from 55.4% in 2020.
Costs of franchise and license revenue decreased $26.0 million, or 21.6%, in 2020. The decrease was primarily related to lower advertising costs, which corresponds to the related advertising revenue decreases noted above. Occupancy costs increased $0.9 million, or 3.6%, in 2020, primarily related to the sale of leased company units to franchisees in the prior year, partially offset by lower percentage rent expense as a result of the sales decreases. Other direct costs increased $0.5 million, or 3.7%, primarily due to $1.5 million of bad debt allowances resulting from actual and expected losses on franchise related receivables due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, costs of franchise and license revenue as a percentage of franchise and license revenue increased to 55.4% for 2020 from 51.2% in 2019.
Other Operating Costs and Expenses
Other operating costs and expenses such as general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expense relate to both company and franchise operations.
General and administrative expenses consisted of the following:
Total general and administrative expenses increased by $13.6 million, or 24.8%, in 2021 and decreased by $14.0 million, or 20.3%, in 2020.
Corporate administrative expenses increased by $3.2 million in 2021 and decreased by $9.2 million in 2020. The 2021 increase was primarily due to prior year temporary cost reductions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including net reductions in tax credits related to the CARES Act of approximately $1.2 million. The 2020 decrease was primarily due to cost savings initiatives related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including tax credits related to the CARES Act of approximately $1.7 million and the rationalization of certain business costs in connection with our refranchising and development strategy.
Share-based compensation increased by $5.7 million and $1.3 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. These increases were primarily the result of plan modifications made in 2020 and related valuations. Incentive compensation increased by $4.3 million in 2021 and decreased by $5.1 million in 2020. The changes in incentive compensation for both periods primarily resulted from our performance against plan metrics. Changes in deferred compensation valuation adjustments have offsetting gains or losses on the underlying nonqualified deferred plan investments included as a component of other nonoperating (income) expense, net.
Depreciation and amortization consisted of the following:
The 2021 decrease in total depreciation and amortization expense was the result of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in 2020. The 2020 decrease in total depreciation and amortization expense was primarily a result of the sale of owned company units to franchisees as part of our refranchising and development strategy during 2019.
Operating (gains), losses and other charges, net consisted of the following:
Gains on sales of assets and other, net of $47.8 million for 2021 primarily related to the sale of three parcels of real estate. Gains on sales of assets and other, net of $4.7 million for the year ended December 30, 2020 primarily related to the sales of real estate. Gains on sales of assets and other, net of $93.6 million for 2019 related to the sale of restaurants and real estate to franchisees.
Restructuring charges and exit costs consisted of the following:
Restructuring and exit costs for 2021 were primarily made up of relocation costs associated with moving certain employees to our support center in the Dallas, Texas area. Restructuring and exit costs for 2020 primarily relate to the Company permanently separating with approximately 50 support center staff. Severance and other restructuring charges for 2019 were primarily the result of positions eliminated as part of our refranchising and development strategy.
Impairment charges of $0.4 million and $4.1 million for the years ended December 29, 2021 and December 30, 2020, respectively, primarily resulted from our assessment of underperforming restaurants.
Operating income was $104.1 million in 2021, $6.7 million in 2020 and $165.0 million in 2019.
Interest expense, net consisted of the following:
Interest expense, net decreased during 2021 primarily due to decreased average borrowings and lower average interest rates. During 2020, interest expense, net decreased primarily due to a reduction in financing lease interest resulting from the sales of restaurants to franchisees during 2019.
Other nonoperating (income) expense, net was income of $15.2 million, $4.2 million, and $2.8 million for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The income for 2021 includes income of $12.8 million related to dedesignated interest rate swap valuation adjustments and $2.2 million in gains on deferred compensation investments. The income for 2020 includes losses on interest rate swaps of $7.4 million resulting from the discontinuance of hedge accounting treatment on a portion of our interest rate swaps and income of $10.3 million related to interest rate swap valuation adjustments on dedesignated interest rate swaps subsequent to the discontinuation of hedge accounting and $1.8 million in gains on deferred compensation plan investments. The income for 2019 primarily resulted from gains on deferred compensation plan investments. For additional details related to the interest rate swaps, see Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
The provision for (benefit from) income taxes was an expense of $26.0 million for 2021, benefit of $2.0 million for 2020 and expense of $31.8 million for 2019. The effective tax rate was 25.0% for 2021, 28.1% for 2020 and 21.3% for 2019.
For 2021, the difference in the overall effective rate from the U.S. statutory rate was primarily due to state and foreign taxes, partially offset by the generation of employment credits. The 2021 rate was also impacted by an expense of $1.3 million from disallowed compensation deductions.
For 2020, the difference in the overall effective rate from the U.S. statutory rate was primarily due to state and foreign taxes, partially offset by the generation of employment credits. The 2020 rate was also impacted by a $0.9 million benefit from the statutory rate differential due to a net operating loss carryback to a prior year and an expense of $1.0 million from disallowed compensation deductions.
For 2019, there was no significant difference between our effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate of 21%. The impact of state taxes on the statutory rate was partially offset by the generation of employment and foreign tax credits. In addition, the 2019 rate benefited $2.0 million related to share-based compensation and $2.0 million related to the completion of an Internal Revenue Service federal income audit of the 2016 tax year.
For additional details related to the provision for (benefit from) income taxes as well as changes in the effective tax rate, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Net income (loss) was income of $78.1 million for 2021, a loss of $5.1 million for 2020 and income of $117.4 million for 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Summary of Cash Flows
Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility (as described below). Principal uses of cash are operating expenses, capital expenditures and the repurchase of shares of our common stock.
The following table presents a summary of our sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the periods indicated:
Net cash flows provided by operating activities were $76.2 million for the year ended December 29, 2021 compared to net cash flows used in operating activities of $3.1 million for the year ended December 30, 2020. The increase in cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities was primarily due to the improvement of operating results in 2021 and the timing of prior year accrual payments. Net cash flows used in operating activities were $3.1 million for the year ended December 30, 2020 compared to net cash flows provided by operating activities of $43.3 million for the year ended December 25, 2019. The decrease in cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities was primarily due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the timing of prior year accrual payments. We believe that our estimated cash flows from operations for 2022, combined with our capacity for additional borrowings under our credit facility, will enable us to meet our anticipated cash requirements and fund capital expenditures over the next twelve months.
Net cash flows provided by investing activities were $29.0 million for the year ended December 29, 2021. These cash flows are primarily proceeds from the sale of real estate and other assets of $50.1 million, partially offset by acquisition of restaurants and real estate of $10.4 million, capital expenditures of $7.4 million and deposits on real estate acquisitions of $3.6 million. Net cash flows provided by investing activities were $4.7 million for the year ended December 30, 2020. These cash flows are primarily proceeds from the sale of real estate of $9.4 million and proceeds from the sale of investments of $2.9 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $7.0 million and investment purchases of $1.4 million. Net cash flows provided by investing activities were $105.0 million for the year ended December 25, 2019. These cash flows are primarily comprised of $129.7 million of proceeds from the sale of assets, including $119.0 million from the sale of 105 restaurants and $10.7 million from the sale of real estate. These cash flows are offset by capital expenditures of $14.0 million and acquisitions of real estate of $11.3 million.
Our principal capital requirements have been largely associated with the following:
Cash flows used in financing activities were $78.5 million for the year ended December 29, 2021, which included net debt repayments of $42.1 million, cash payments for stock repurchases of $30.0 million, net bank overdraft payments of $3.1 million, and deferred financing costs of $1.9 million. Cash flows used in financing activities were $1.0 million for the year ended December 30, 2020, which included net debt repayments of $31.6 million, cash payments for stock repurchases of $36.0 million offset by proceeds of $69.6 million from the issuance of common stock. Cash flows used in financing activities were
$150.0 million for the year ended December 25, 2019, which included stock repurchases of $94.5 million and net debt repayments of $49.0 million.
Our working capital deficit was $28.3 million at December 29, 2021 compared with $28.5 million at December 30, 2020 as increased cash from the sales of real estate was offset by an increase in current liabilities. We are able to operate with a substantial working capital deficit because (1) restaurant operations and most food service operations are conducted primarily on a cash and cash equivalent basis with a low level of accounts receivable, (2) rapid turnover allows a limited investment in inventories and (3) accounts payable for food, beverages and supplies usually become due after the receipt of cash from the related sales.
Credit Facility
On August 26, 2021, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries refinanced the existing credit facility (the “Old Credit Facility”) and entered into a new five-year $400 million senior secured revolver (with a $25 million letter of credit sublimit) (the “New Credit Facility”). The New Credit Facility includes an accordion feature that would allow us to increase the size of the revolver to $450 million. Borrowings bear a tiered interest rate, which is based on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio and was initially set at LIBOR plus 2.25%. The New Credit Facility contains provisions specifying alternative interest rate calculations to be used at such time LIBOR ceases to be available as a benchmark due to reference rate reform. The maturity date for the New Credit Facility is August 26, 2026.
The New Credit Facility was used to refinance the Old Credit Facility and is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The New Credit Facility is guaranteed by Denny's and its material subsidiaries and is secured by assets of Denny's and its subsidiaries, including the stock of its subsidiaries (other than its insurance captive subsidiary). It includes negative covenants that are usual for facilities and transactions of this type. The New Credit Facility also includes certain financial covenants with respect to a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of December 29, 2021.
As of December 29, 2021, we had outstanding revolver loans of $170.0 million and outstanding letters of credit under the New Credit Facility of $15.7 million. These balances resulted in availability of $214.3 million as of December 29, 2021 under the New Credit Facility.
As of December 29, 2021, borrowings under the New Credit Facility bore interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.00% and the
commitment fee, paid on the unused portion of the New Credit Facility, was set to 0.30%.
During 2020, we executed amendments to the Old Credit Facility on May 13, 2020 and on December 15, 2020. As a result of the amendments, the interest rate of the Old Credit Facility was increased to LIBOR plus 3.00% and the commitment fee, paid on the unused portion of the credit facility, was increased to 0.40%. The amendments required supplemental monthly reporting obligations to our lenders and we were prohibited from paying dividends and making stock repurchases and other general investments. Additionally, capital expenditures were restricted and certain financial covenants were waived for a period. The amendments also added a monthly minimum liquidity covenant. As of December 15, 2020, the accordion feature was removed, and the total credit facility commitment was reduced from $400 million to $375 million and to $350 million on July 1, 2021.
Prior to considering the impact of our interest rate swaps, described below, the weighted-average interest rate on outstanding revolver loans was 2.09% and 3.15% as of December 29, 2021 and December 30, 2020, respectively. Taking into consideration our interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges, the weighted-average interest rate of outstanding revolver loans was 4.44% and 5.01% as of December 29, 2021 and December 30, 2020, respectively.
Interest Rate Hedges
We have interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the forecasted cash flows of our floating rate debt. See Part II
