Executive Overview
We are a global automotive technology leader in Seating and E-Systems, enabling superior in-vehicle experiences for consumers around the world. We supply seating, electrical distribution and connection systems and electronic systems to all of the world's major automotive manufacturers.
Lear is built on a foundation and strong culture of innovation, operational excellence, and engineering and program management capabilities. We use our product, design and technological expertise, as well as our global reach and competitive manufacturing footprint, to achieve our financial goals and objectives. These include continuing to deliver profitable growth (balancing risks and returns); investing in innovation to drive business growth and profitability; maintaining a strong balance sheet with investment grade credit metrics; and consistently returning capital to our stockholders. Further, we have aligned our strategy with the key trends affecting our business - electrification, connectivity, autonomy and shared mobility. At Lear, we are Making every drive betterTM by providing technology for safer, smarter and more comfortable journeys, while adhering to our values - Be Inclusive. Be Inventive. Get Results the Right Way.
Our business is organized under two reporting segments: Seating and E-Systems. Each of these segments has a varied product and technology range across a number of component categories.
Our Seating business consists of the design, development, engineering and manufacture of complete seat systems, seat subsystems and key seat components. Our capabilities in operations and supply chain management enable synchronized (just-in-time) assembly and delivery of high volumes of complex complete seat systems to our customers. Included in our complete seat system and subsystem solutions are advanced comfort, wellness and safety offerings, as well as configurable seating product technologies. All of these products are compatible with traditional internal combustion engine ("ICE") architectures and the full range of hybrid, plug-in hybrid and battery electric architectures (collectively, "electrified powertrains"). Our advanced comfort, wellness and safety offerings are facilitated by our system, component and integration capabilities, together with our in-house electronics, sensor, software and algorithm competencies. We anticipate that our comfort offerings will be enhanced by the acquisition of substantially all of Kongsberg Automotive's Interior Comfort Systems business unit ("Kongsberg"), which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022. As the most vertically integrated global seat supplier, our key seat component product offerings include seat trim covers, surface materials such as leather and fabric, seat mechanisms, seat foam and headrests.
Our E-Systems business consists of the design, development, engineering and manufacture of complete electrical distribution and connection systems and electronic systems. The combination of these capabilities enables us to provide our customers with customizable solutions with optimized designs at a competitive cost. Electrical distribution and connection systems utilize low voltage wire, high voltage wire, high speed data cables and flat wiring to connect networks and electrical signals and manage electrical power within the vehicle for all types of powertrains - from traditional ICE architectures to the full range of electrified powertrains. Key components in our electrical distribution and connection systems portfolio include wire harnesses, terminals and connectors and engineered components for both ICE architectures and electrified powertrains that require management of higher voltage and power. Electronic systems facilitate signal, data and power management within the vehicle and include the associated software required to facilitate these functions. Key components in our electronic systems portfolio include body domain control modules and products specific to electrification and connectivity. Electrification products include on-board battery chargers, power conversion modules, high voltage battery management systems and high voltage power distribution systems. Connectivity products include telematics control units ("TCU") and gateway modules to manage both wired and wireless networks and data in vehicles. In addition to electronic modules, we offer software that includes cybersecurity, advanced vehicle positioning for automated and autonomous driving applications and full capabilities in both dedicated short-range communication and cellular protocols for vehicle connectivity. Our software offerings include embedded control software and cloud and mobile device-based software and services. Our customers traditionally have sourced our electronic hardware together with the software that we embed in it.
We serve all of the world's major automotive manufacturers across both our Seating and E-Systems businesses, and we have automotive content on more than 450 vehicle nameplates worldwide. It is common for us to have both seating and electrical and/or electronic content on the same vehicle platform.
Our businesses benefit globally from leveraging common operating standards and disciplines, including world-class product development and manufacturing processes, as well as common customer support and regional infrastructures, all of which contribute to our reputation for operational excellence. Our core capabilities are shared across component categories and include: high-precision manufacturing and assembly with short lead times; management of complex supply chains; global engineering and program management skills; the agility to establish and/or transfer production between facilities quickly; and, a unique customer-focused culture. Our businesses utilize proprietary, industry-specific processes and standards, leverage
common low-cost engineering centers and share centralized operating support functions. These functions include logistics, supply chain management, quality, health and safety, and all major administrative functions.
Industry Overview
Our sales are driven by the number of vehicles produced by the automotive manufacturers, which is ultimately dependent on the availability of raw materials and components and consumer demand for automotive vehicles, and our content per vehicle. In 2020, unprecedented industry disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the first half of the year, impacted our operations in every region of the world. Although industry production increased 3% in 2021 over 2020, production remains well below recent historic levels and consumer demand. Production in the second half of 2021 decreased 16% relative to the second half of 2020. This was largely due to the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, particularly through supply shortages. The most significant supply shortage relates to semiconductor chips, which impacted global vehicle production and resulted in reductions and cancellations of planned production. In addition, we experienced increased costs related to labor shortages and inefficiencies and ongoing costs related to personal protective equipment, all of which are likely to continue for a period of time. Increases in certain commodity costs, as well as transportation and logistics costs, are also impacting, and will continue to impact, our operating results for the foreseeable future. Further, a resurgence of the COVID-19 virus or its variants, including corresponding "stay at home" or similar government orders impacting industry production, could impact our financial results. For risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including supply shortages, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors."
Global automotive industry production volumes in 2021, as compared to 2020, are shown below (in thousands of units):
(1) Production data based on IHS Markit.
(2) Production data for 2020 has been updated from our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect actual production levels.
Automotive sales and production can be affected by the age of the vehicle fleet and related scrappage rates, labor relations issues, fuel prices, regulatory requirements, government initiatives, trade agreements, the availability and cost of credit, the availability of critical components needed to complete the production of vehicles, restructuring actions of our customers and suppliers, facility closures, changing consumer attitudes toward vehicle ownership and usage and other factors. Our operating results are also significantly impacted by the overall commercial success of the vehicle platforms for which we supply particular products, as well as the level of vertical integration and profitability of the products that we supply for these platforms. The loss of business with respect to any vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier, or a decrease in the production levels of any such models, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, larger cars and light trucks, as well as vehicle platforms that offer more features and functionality, such as luxury, sport utility and crossover vehicles, typically have more content and, therefore, tend to have a more significant impact on our operating results.
Our percentage of consolidated net sales by region in 2021 and 2020 is shown below:
Our ability to reduce the risks inherent in certain concentrations of business, and thereby maintain our financial performance in the future, will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to diversify our sales on a customer, product, platform and geographic basis to reflect the market overall.
The automotive industry, and our business, continue to be shaped by the broad trends of electrification, connectivity, autonomy, and shared mobility. We also consider demand and regulatory developments for improved energy efficiency, sustainability,
enhanced safety and communications (e.g., government mandates related to fuel economy, carbon emissions and safety equipment) to be significant drivers of these trends, each of which is likely to be at the forefront of our industry for the foreseeable future.
In addition to key foundational attributes imperative for success as an automotive supplier (quality, service and cost), our strategic initiatives focus on furthering our competitive differentiation through vertical integration, disruptive innovation and advanced manufacturing technology. We have expanded key component capabilities through organic investment and acquisitions to ensure a full complement of the best solutions for our customers. We have restructured, and continue to align, our manufacturing and engineering footprint to attain a leading competitive cost position globally. We have established or expanded activities in new and growing markets, in support of our customers' growth initiatives and in pursuit of opportunities with new customers. These initiatives have helped us achieve our financial goals overall, as well as a more balanced regional, customer and vehicle segment diversification in our business.
For further information related to these trends and our strategy, see Part 1 - Item 1, "Business - Industry and Strategy."
Our customers typically require us to reduce our prices over the life of a vehicle model and, at the same time, assume significant responsibility for the design, development and engineering of our products. Our financial performance is largely dependent on our ability to offset these price reductions with product cost reductions through product design enhancement, supply chain management, manufacturing efficiencies and restructuring actions. We also seek to enhance our financial performance by investing in product development, design capabilities and new product initiatives that respond to and anticipate the needs of our customers and consumers. We continually evaluate operational and strategic alternatives to improve our business structure and align our business with the changing needs of our customers and major industry trends affecting our business.
Our material cost as a percentage of net sales was 65.4% in 2021, as compared to 64.3% in 2020 and 65.0% in 2019, reflecting increases in certain commodity costs. Raw material, energy and commodity costs can be volatile, reflecting changes in supply and demand and global trade and tariff policies. Our primary commodity cost exposures relate to steel, copper and leather. We have developed and implemented strategies to mitigate the impact of higher raw material, energy and commodity costs, such as the selective in-sourcing of components, the continued consolidation of our supply base, longer-term purchase commitments, contractual recovery mechanisms and the selective expansion of low-cost country sourcing and engineering, as well as value engineering and product benchmarking. Further, our exposure to changes in steel prices is primarily indirect, through purchased components, and a significant portion of our copper, leather and direct steel purchases are subject to price index agreements with our customers and suppliers. However, these strategies, together with commercial negotiations with our customers and suppliers, typically do not offset all of the adverse impact. Certain of these strategies also may limit our opportunities in a declining commodity price environment. In addition, the availability of raw materials, commodities and product components fluctuates from time to time due to factors outside of our control. If these costs increase or availability is restricted, it could have an adverse impact on our operating results in the foreseeable future. See Part I - Item 1A, "Risk Factors - Increases in the costs and restrictions on the availability of raw materials, energy, commodities and product components could adversely affect our financial performance," and "- Forward-Looking Statements" below.
Financial Measures
In evaluating our financial condition and operating performance, we focus primarily on earnings, operating margins, cash flows and return on invested capital. Our strategy includes expanding our business with new and existing customers globally through new products, including electrification. Asia continues to present long-term growth opportunities, as we focus on expanding our market share and content per vehicle, as demand for luxury and performance features increases in this region. In addition to our wholly owned locations, we currently have thirteen operating joint ventures with operations in Asia, as well as two additional joint ventures in North America dedicated to serving Asian automotive manufacturers. We also have selectively increased our vertical integration capabilities globally, as well as expanded our component manufacturing capacity in Asia, Eastern Europe, Mexico and Northern Africa and our low-cost engineering capabilities in Asia, Eastern Europe and Northern Africa.
Our success in generating cash flow will depend, in part, on our ability to manage working capital effectively. Working capital can be significantly impacted by the timing of cash flows from sales and purchases. Historically, we generally have been successful in aligning our vendor payment terms with our customer payment terms. However, our ability to continue to do so may be impacted by adverse automotive industry conditions, changes to our customers' payment terms and the financial condition of our suppliers, as well as our financial condition. In addition, our cash flow is impacted by our ability to manage our inventory and capital spending effectively. We utilize return on invested capital as a measure of the efficiency with which our assets generate earnings. Improvements in our return on invested capital will depend on our ability to maintain an appropriate asset base for our business and to increase productivity and operating efficiency.
Acquisitions
Kongsberg
In October 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Kongsberg, which specializes in comfort seating solutions, including massage, lumbar, seat heat and ventilation. With almost 50 years of experience, Kongsberg has cutting-edge technology, a well-balanced customer portfolio built on longstanding relationships with leading premium automotive manufacturers and an experienced and dedicated team. The acquisition is expected to further advance our seat component capabilities into specialized comfort seating solutions that further differentiate our product offerings and improve vehicle performance and packaging - important features across various vehicle segments. The transaction is valued at approximately €175 million, on a cash and debt free basis. The acquisition, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions and adjustments, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.
M&N Plastics
In March 2021, we completed the acquisition of M&N Plastics, an injection molding specialist and manufacturer of engineered plastic components for automotive electrical distribution applications. When combined with our continuing organic investments in connection systems, the addition of M&N Plastics enhances the ability of our E-Systems business to vertically integrate the engineering and production of complex parts for electrical distribution, including high-voltage wire harnesses and power electronics, creating a strong platform for future revenue growth and margin expansion in our overall E-Systems business. The acquisition is not material to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
Xevo
In April 2019, we completed the acquisition of Xevo Inc. ("Xevo"), a Seattle-based, global leader in connected car software, by acquiring all of Xevo's outstanding shares for $322 million, net of cash acquired. Xevo is a supplier of software solutions for the cloud, vehicles and mobile devices that are deployed in millions of vehicles worldwide.
For further information, see Note 4, "Acquisitions," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
Operational Restructuring
In 2021, we incurred pretax restructuring costs of $101 million and related manufacturing inefficiency charges of approximately $12 million, as compared to pretax restructuring costs of $145 million and related manufacturing inefficiency charges of approximately $5 million in 2020. None of the individual restructuring actions initiated during 2021 were material. Further, there have been no changes in previously initiated restructuring actions that have resulted (or will result) in a material change to our restructuring costs.
Our restructuring actions include plant closures and workforce reductions and are initiated to maintain our competitive footprint or are in response to customer initiatives or changes in global and regional automotive markets. Our restructuring actions are designed to maintain or improve our operating results and profitability throughout the automotive industry cycles. Restructuring actions are generally funded within twelve months of initiation and are funded by cash flows from operating activities and existing cash balances. We expect to incur approximately $44 million of additional restructuring costs related to activities initiated as of December 31, 2021, all of which are expected to be incurred in the next twelve months. We plan to implement additional restructuring actions in order to align our manufacturing capacity and other costs with prevailing regional automotive production levels. Such future restructuring actions are dependent on market conditions, customer actions and other factors.
For further information, see Note 5, "Restructuring," and Note 15, "Segment Reporting," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
Financing Transactions
Senior Notes
In November 2021, we issued $350 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of 2032 notes (the "2032 Notes") and $350 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of 2052 notes (the "2052 Notes"). The 2032 Notes have a stated coupon rate of 2.6% and were issued at 99.782% of par, resulting in a yield to maturity of 2.624%. The 2052 Notes have a stated coupon rate of 3.55% and were issued at 99.845% of par, resulting in a yield to maturity of 3.558%.
Net proceeds from the offering of $699 million, after original issue discount, were used, in part, to fund the tender of $200 million in aggregate principal amount of our 3.8% senior notes due in 2027 (the "2027 Notes") and the repayment in full of $206 million outstanding on our term loan facility. We expect to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes,
which may include the purchase price for the Kongsberg acquisition. For further information, see Note 4, "Acquisitions," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
In connection with these transactions, we recognized a loss of $24 million on the extinguishment of debt and paid related issuance costs of $7 million.
For further information, see "- Liquidity and Financial Condition - Capitalization - Senior Notes" below and Note 7 "Debt," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
Credit Agreement
Our unsecured credit agreement consisted of a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility and a $250 million term loan facility. In October 2021, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that increased the revolving credit facility to $2.0 billion and extended the maturity date to October 28, 2026. In November 2021, we repaid in full $206 million outstanding on our term loan facility. In connection with these transactions, we recognized a loss of $1 million on the extinguishment of debt and paid related issuance costs of $3 million.
For further information, see "- Liquidity and Financial Condition - Capitalization - Credit Agreement" below and Note 7, "Debt," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
Share Repurchase Program and Quarterly Cash Dividends
We may implement share repurchases through a variety of methods, including, but not limited to, open market purchases, accelerated stock repurchase programs and structured repurchase transactions. The extent to which we may repurchase our outstanding common stock and the timing of such repurchases will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, prevailing market conditions, alternative uses of capital and other factors (see "- Forward-Looking Statements" below).
Since the first quarter of 2011, our Board of Directors has authorized $6.1 billion in share repurchases under our common stock share repurchase program. In March 2020, as a proactive measure in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we suspended share repurchases under our common stock share repurchase program. Share repurchases were reinstated in the second quarter of 2021. Since the reinstatement through December 31, 2021, we repurchased approximately $100 million of shares. As of December 31, 2021, we have a remaining repurchase authorization of $1.3 billion, which expires on December 31, 2022.
In 2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock in the first and second quarters, a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share of common stock in the third quarter and a quarterly cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock in the fourth quarter, returning our quarterly cash dividend to its pre-COVID-19 pandemic level.
In 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock in the first quarter. In March 2020, as a proactive measure in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we suspended our quarterly cash dividend. The quarterly cash dividend was reinstated in the fourth quarter at $0.25 per share of common stock.

Results of Operations
A summary of our operating results in millions of dollars and as a percentage of net sales is shown below:
Year Ended December 31, 2021, Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2020
Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $19.3 billion, as compared to $17.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $2.2 billion or 13%. New business in North America, Europe and Africa, and Asia increased
net sales by $0.9 billion. Net sales also benefited by $0.5 billion and $0.4 billion as a result of higher production volumes on Lear platforms in North America, South America and Asia and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, respectively.
Cost of sales in 2021 was $17.9 billion, as compared to $15.9 billion in 2020. New business in North America, Europe and Africa, and Asia increased cost of sales. Cost of sales also increased as a result of higher production volumes on Lear platforms in North America, South America and Africa, and Asia and foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
Gross profit and gross margin were $1.4 billion and 7.2% of net sales in 2021, as compared to $1.1 billion and 6.5% of net sales in 2020. The impact of new business and higher production volumes on Lear platforms increased gross profit by $180 million. Favorable operating performance, including the benefit of operational restructuring actions, and lower restructuring costs, were partially offset by the impact of selling price reductions and increased commodity costs. These factors had a corresponding impact on gross margin.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, including engineering and development expenses, were $643 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $589 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily reflecting increases in restructuring costs and compensation-related costs related to our 2020 salary reduction and deferral actions. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 3.3% in 2021, as compared to 3.5% in 2020.
Amortization of intangible assets was $73 million in 2021, including an impairment charge of $9 million, as compared to $66 million in 2020.
Interest expense was $92 million in 2021, as compared to $100 million in 2020.
Other expense, net, which includes non-income related taxes, foreign exchange gains and losses, gains and losses related to certain derivative instruments and hedging activities, losses on the extinguishment of debt, gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets, gains and losses on the consolidation and deconsolidation of affiliates, the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost and other miscellaneous income and expense, was $0.1 million in 2021, as compared to $55 million in 2020. In 2021, we recognized a gain of $45 million related to a favorable indirect tax ruling in a foreign jurisdiction and losses of $25 million related to the extinguishment of debt and $2 million related to the impairment and liquidation of an investment. In 2020, we recognized losses of $21 million related to the extinguishment of debt, $13 million related to a pension settlement and $4 million related to the impairment of an investment.
In 2021, the provision for income taxes was $138 million, representing an effective tax rate of 23.6% on pretax income before equity in net income of affiliates of $584 million. In 2020, the provision for income taxes was $94 million, representing an effective tax rate of 31.4% on pretax income before equity in net income of affiliates of $299 million.
In 2021 and 2020, the provision for income taxes was primarily impacted by the level and mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. In 2021, we recognized tax benefits of $39 million related to restructuring charges and various other items, offset by tax expense of $17 million related to the net increase in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets of foreign subsidiaries and $8 million on a $45 million gain related to a favorable indirect tax ruling in a foreign jurisdiction. In 2020, we recognized tax benefits of $34 million related to restructuring charges and various other items and $15 million related to the U.S. deferred tax effect of our foreign branches and tax expense of $29 million related to a net increase in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets.
For information related to our valuation allowances, see "Other Matters - Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates - Income Taxes" below.
Equity in net income of affiliates was $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $29 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting lower sales at certain of our affiliates in China.
Net income attributable to Lear was $374 million, or $6.19 per diluted share, in 2021, as compared to $159 million, or $2.62 per diluted share, in 2020. Net income and diluted net income per share decreased for the reasons described above.
Reportable Operating Segments
We have two reportable operating segments: Seating and E-Systems. For a description of our reportable operating segments, see "Executive Overview" above.
The financial information presented below is for our two reportable operating segments and our other category for the periods presented. The other category includes unallocated costs related to corporate headquarters, regional headquarters and the elimination of intercompany activities, none of which meets the requirements for being classified as an operating segment. Corporate and regional headquarters costs include various support functions, such as information technology, advanced research and development, corporate finance, legal, executive administration and human resources. Financial measures regarding each segment's pretax income before equity in net income of affiliates, interest expense and other expense, net ("segment earnings") and segment earnings divided by net sales ("margin") are not measures of performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). Segment earnings and the related margin are used by management to evaluate the performance of our reportable operating segments. Segment earnings should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income attributable to Lear, net cash provided by operating activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as measures of profitability or liquidity. In addition, segment earnings, as we determine it, may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
For a reconciliation of consolidated segment earnings to consolidated income before provision for income taxes and equity in net income of affiliates, see Note 15, "Segment Reporting," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
Seating -
A summary of financial measures for our Seating segment is shown below (dollar amounts in millions):
(1) See definition above.
Seating net sales were $14.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $12.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $1.7 billion or 13%. Higher production volumes on Lear platforms increased net sales by $679 million. Net sales also benefited by $486 million and $295 million as a result of new business and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, respectively.
Segment earnings, including restructuring costs, and the related margin on net sales were $851 million and 5.9% in 2021, as compared to $591 million and 4.6% in 2020. Higher production volumes on Lear platforms and the impact of new business increased segment earnings by $176 million. Favorable operating performance, including the benefit of operational restructuring actions, and lower restructuring costs were partially offset by the impact of selling price reductions and increased commodity costs.
E-Systems -
A summary of financial measures for our E-Systems segment is shown below (dollar amounts in millions):
(1) See definition above.
E-Systems net sales were $4.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $4.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $519 million or 12%. New business, commodity recoveries and foreign exchange rate fluctuations increased net sales by $425 million, $175 million and $112 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by lower production volumes on Lear platforms which reduced net sales by $198 million.
Segment earnings, including restructuring costs, and the related margin on net sales were $121 million and 2.5% in 2021, as compared to $98 million and 2.3% in 2020. The impact of new business was offset by lower production volumes on Lear platforms. Improved operating performance was partially offset by the impact of selling price reductions and increased commodity costs.
Other -
A summary of financial measures for our other category, which is not an operating segment, is shown below (dollar amounts in millions):
(1) See definition above.
Segment earnings related to our other category were ($297) million in 2021, as compared to ($235) million in 2020, primarily reflecting an increase in compensation-related costs related to our 2020 salary reduction and deferral actions, as well as 2020 reductions in discretionary spending.
Year Ended December 31, 2020, Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2019
For a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with the year ended December 31, 2019, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary liquidity needs are to fund general business requirements, including working capital requirements, capital expenditures, operational restructuring actions and debt service requirements. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under available credit facilities and our existing cash balance.
Cash Provided by Subsidiaries
A substantial portion of our operating income is generated by our subsidiaries. As a result, we are dependent on the earnings and cash flows of and the combination of dividends, royalties, intercompany loan repayments and other distributions and advances from our subsidiaries to provide the funds necessary to meet our obligations.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, cash and cash equivalents of $661 million and $780 million, respectively, were held in foreign subsidiaries and can be repatriated, primarily through the repayment of intercompany loans and the payment of dividends, without creating additional income tax expense. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to Lear. For further information regarding potential dividends from our non-U.S. subsidiaries, see "- Adequacy of Liquidity Sources" below and Note 9, "Income Taxes," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
Adequacy of Liquidity Sources
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand and $2.0 billion in available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. Together with cash provided by operating activities, we believe that this will enable us to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future and to satisfy ordinary course business obligations. In addition, we expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our authorized common stock share repurchase program, although such actions are at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, prevailing market conditions, alternative uses of capital and other factors that our Board of Directors may consider at its discretion.
Our future financial results and our ability to continue to meet our liquidity needs are subject to, and will be affected by, cash flows from operations, including the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as restructuring activities, automotive industry conditions, the financial condition of our customers and suppliers, supply chain disruptions and other related factors. Additionally, an economic downturn or reduction in production levels could negatively impact our financial condition.
For further discussion of the risks and uncertainties affecting our cash flows from operations and our overall liquidity, see Part I - Item 1A, "Risk Factors," and "- Executive Overview" above and "- Forward-Looking Statements" below.
Cash Flows
Year Ended December 31, 2021, Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2020
A summary of net cash provided by operating activities is shown below (in millions):
In 2021 and 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $670 million and $663 million, respectively. Higher earnings in 2021 were offset by an incremental increase in working capital in 2021, as compared to 2020, reflecting increased inventory levels due to unpredictable production schedules as a result of industry-wide supply shortages.
Net cash used in investing activities was $647 million in 2021, as compared to $469 million in 2020. In 2021, capital spending was $585 million, as compared to $452 million in 2020. Capital spending is estimated to be $650 million to $700 million in 2022.
Net cash used in financing activities was $14 million in 2021, as compared to $412 million in 2020. In 2021, we received net proceeds of $699 million related to the issuance of 2032 and 2052 Notes and paid $7 million of related issuance costs. Also in 2021, we repurchased $200 million of our outstanding 2027 Notes for $222 million, including an early tender premium and fees, and made principal payments under our term loan facility of $220 million. In 2020, we received net proceeds of $669 million related to the issuance of our senior notes due 2030 and 2049 and paid $6 million of related issuance costs. Also in 2020, we paid $667 million related to the redemption of our outstanding senior notes due 2025. In 2020, as a proactive measure in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we borrowed $1.0 billion under our Revolving Credit Facility in the first quarter of 2020, which was repaid in full in the third quarter of 2020. In 2021, we paid $100 million for repurchases of our common stock, $107 million of dividends to Lear stockholders and $81 million of dividends to noncontrolling interest holders. In 2020, we paid $70 million for repurchases of our common stock, $67 million of dividends to Lear stockholders and $123 million of dividends to noncontrolling interest holders.
For further information regarding our 2021 and 2020 financing transactions, see "- Capitalization" below and Note 7, "Debt," and Note 12, "Capital Stock, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss and Equity," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
Year Ended December 31, 2020, Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2019
For a discussion of our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with the year ended December 31, 2019, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Capitalization
From time to time, we utilize uncommitted lines of credit to fund our capital expenditures and working capital requirements at certain of our foreign subsidiaries, in addition to cash provided by operating activities. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no short-term debt balances outstanding. The availability of uncommitted lines of credit may be affected by our financial performance, credit ratings and other factors.
Senior Notes
As of December 31, 2021, our senior notes (collectively, the "Notes") consist of the amounts shown below (in millions, except stated coupon rates):
The issue, maturity and interest payment dates of the Notes are shown below:
(1) Commencing July 15, 2022.
In 2021, we issued $350 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of 2032 Notes and $350 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of 2052 Notes. The 2032 Notes have a stated coupon rate of 2.6% and were issued at 99.782% of par, resulting in a yield to maturity of 2.624%. The 2052 Notes have a stated coupon rate of 3.55% and were issued at 99.845% of par, resulting in a yield to maturity of 3.558%.
The net proceeds from the offering of $699 million, after original issue discount, were used, in part, to fund the tender of $200 million in aggregate principal amount of 2027 Notes and the repayment in full of $206 million outstanding on our term loan facility. We expect to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include the purchase price for the Kongsberg acquisition (Note 4, "Acquisitions").
In connection with these transactions, we recognized a loss of $24 million on the extinguishment of debt and paid related issuance costs of $7 million.
In 2020, we issued $350 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of 2030 Notes and an additional $300 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of 2049 Notes. The 2030 Notes have a stated coupon rate of 3.5% and were issued at 99.774% of par, resulting in a yield to maturity of 3.525%. The 2049 Notes have a stated coupon rate of 5.25% and were issued at 106.626% of par, resulting in a yield to maturity of 4.821%.
The net proceeds from the offering of $669 million, after original issue discount, were used to redeem $650 million in aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes at a redemption price equal to 102.625% of the principal amount of such 2025 Notes, plus accrued interest.
In connection with these transactions, we recognized a loss of $21 million on the extinguishment of debt and paid related issuance costs of $6 million.
In 2019, we issued $375 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of 2029 Notes and $325 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of 2049 Notes. The 2029 Notes have a stated coupon rate of 4.25% and were issued at 99.691% of par, resulting in a yield to maturity of 4.288%. The 2049 Notes have a stated coupon rate of 5.25% and were issued at 98.32% of par, resulting in a yield to maturity of 5.363%.
The net proceeds from the offering of $693 million, after original issue discount, were used to redeem $325 million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due in 2024 (the "2024 Notes") at a redemption price equal to 102.688% of the
principal amount of such 2024 Notes, plus accrued interest, as well as to finance the Xevo acquisition and for general corporate purposes.
In connection with these transactions, we recognized a loss of $11 million on the extinguishment of debt and paid related issuance costs of $7 million.
The indentures governing the Notes contain certain restrictive covenants and customary events of default. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all covenants under the indentures governing the Notes.
For further information related to the Notes, including information on early redemption, covenants and events of default, see Note 7, "Debt," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report and the indentures governing the Notes, which have been incorporated by reference as exhibits to this Report.
Credit Agreement
Our unsecured credit agreement, dated August 8, 2017, consisted of a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") and a $250 million term loan facility (the "Term Loan Facility"). In October 2021, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") that increased the Revolving Credit Facility to $2.0 billion and extended the maturity date to October 28, 2026. In November 2021, we repaid in full $206 million outstanding on the Term Loan facility. In connection with these transactions, we recognized a loss of approximately $1 million on the extinguishment of debt and paid related issuance costs of approximately $3 million.
In March 2020, as a proactive measure in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we borrowed $1.0 billion under the Revolving Credit Facility, which was repaid in full in September 2020.
The Credit Agreement contains various financial and other covenants that require us to remain below a maximum leverage coverage ratio. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement.
For further information related to the Credit Agreement, including information on pricing, covenants and events of default, see Note 7, "Debt," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report and the Credit Agreement, which has been incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this Report.
Common Stock Share Repurchase Program
See Item 5, "Market for the Company's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities."
Dividends
In 2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock in the first and second quarters, a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share of common stock in the third quarter and a quarterly cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock in the fourth quarter, returning our quarterly cash dividend to its pre-COVID-19 pandemic level.
In 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock in the first quarter. In March 2020, as a proactive measure in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we suspended our quarterly cash dividend. The quarterly cash dividend was reinstated in the fourth quarter at $0.25 per share of common stock.
In 2019, our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.75 per share of common stock.
We expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, although such payments are at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, prevailing market conditions, alternative uses of capital and other factors that our Board of Directors may consider at its discretion. See "- Forward-Looking Statements" below and Note 7, "Debt," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
Contractual Obligations and Cash Requirements
Our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations:
Debt obligations and interest expense associated with debt obligations
As of December 31, 2021, we had $2.6 billion of outstanding senior unsecured notes maturing in 2027 through 2052, as well as $2.0 billion available for borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility. Interest on the Notes is due biannually at varying dates. Scheduled interest payments are shown below (in millions):
For further information related to our debt, see "Capitalization - Senior Notes" and "- Credit Agreement" above and Note 7, "Debt," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
Purchase obligations
We enter into agreements with our customers to produce products at the beginning of a vehicle's life cycle. Although these agreements do not provide for a specified quantity of products, once entered into, we are generally required to fulfill our customers' purchasing requirements for the production life of the vehicle. Prior to being formally awarded a program, we typically work closely with our customers in the early stages of the design and engineering of a vehicle's systems. Failure to complete the design and engineering work related to a vehicle's systems, or to fulfill a customer agreement, could have a material adverse impact on our business.
We also enter into agreements with suppliers to assist us in meeting our customers' production needs. These agreements vary as to duration and quantity commitments. Historically, most have been short-term agreements, which do not provide for minimum purchases, or are requirements-based agreements.
Leases
The Company has operating leases for production, office and warehouse facilities, manufacturing and office equipment, and vehicles with future lease obligations ranging from 2022 through 2047. Maturities of operating leases obligations are shown below (in millions):
For further information related to our lease obligations, see Note 8, "Leases," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
Taxes
We may be required to make significant cash outlays related to our unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties. As of December 31, 2021, we had unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, of $48 million. However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities.
For further information related to our unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 9, "Income Taxes," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
Pension and postretirement obligations
We have minimum funding requirements with respect to certain of our pension benefit obligations. We may elect to make contributions in excess of the minimum funding requirements in response to investment performance or changes in interest rates or when we believe that it is financially advantageous to do so and based on our other cash requirements. Our minimum funding requirements after 2022 will depend on several factors, including investment performance and interest rates. Our minimum funding requirements may also be affected by changes in applicable legal requirements. Contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately $2 million in 2022.
We do not fund our postretirement benefit obligations and certain of our pension benefit obligations. Rather, benefit payments are made to eligible participants as incurred. We expect benefit payments related to our unfunded pension and postretirement benefit obligations to be approximately $7 million and $6 million, respectively, in 2022.
For further information related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans, see "- Other Matters - Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans" below and Note 10, "Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
Acquisitions
Our acquisition of Kongsberg will be funded primarily by cash flows from operating activities and existing cash on hand, which may include proceeds from the issuance of our 2032 Notes and 2052 Notes.
For further information, see Note 4, "Acquisitions," and Note 7, "Debt," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
Market Risk Sensitivity
In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. We manage a portion of these risks through the use of derivative financial instruments in accordance with our policies. We enter into all hedging transactions for periods consistent with the underlying exposures. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes.
Foreign Exchange
Operating results may be impacted by our buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currency of our operating companies ("transactional exposure"). We may mitigate a portion of this risk by entering into forward foreign exchange, futures and option contracts. The foreign exchange contracts are executed with banks that we believe are creditworthy. Gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts are deferred where appropriate and included in the measurement of the foreign currency transaction subject to the hedge. Gains and losses incurred related to foreign exchange contracts are generally offset by the direct effects of currency movements on the underlying transactions.
A summary of the notional amount and estimated aggregate fair value of our outstanding foreign exchange contracts is shown below (in millions):
Currently, our most significant foreign currency transactional exposures relate to the Mexican peso, various European currencies, the Chinese renminbi, the Brazilian real, the Thai baht, the Japanese yen and the Honduran lempira. A sensitivity analysis of our net transactional exposure is shown below (in millions):
(1) Relative to all other currencies to which it is exposed for a twelve-month period.
A sensitivity analysis related to the aggregate fair value of our outstanding foreign exchange contracts is shown below (in millions):
(2) Relative to all other currencies to which it is exposed.
There are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses above. The analyses assume that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the U.S. dollar or Euro. In reality, some currencies may strengthen while others may
weaken, causing the earnings impact to increase or decrease depending on the currency and the direction of the rate movement.
In addition to the transactional exposure described above, our operating results are impacted by the translation of our foreign operating income into U.S. dollars ("translational exposure"). In 2021, net sales outside of the United States accounted for 77% of our consolidated net sales, although certain non-U.S. sales are U.S. dollar denominated. We do not enter into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate our translational exposure.
Commodity Prices
Raw material, energy and commodity costs can be volatile, reflecting changes in supply and demand and global trade and tariff policies. Our primary commodity cost exposures relate to steel, copper and leather. We have developed and implemented strategies to mitigate the impact of higher raw material, energy and commodity costs, such as the selective in-sourcing of components, the continued consolidation of our supply base, longer-term purchase commitments, contractual recovery mechanisms and the selective expansion of low-cost country sourcing and engineering, as well as value engineering and product benchmarking. Further, our exposure to changes in steel prices is primarily indirect, through purchased components, and a significant portion of our copper, leather and direct steel purchases are subject to price index agreements with our customers and suppliers. However, these strategies, together with commercial negotiations with our customers and suppliers, typically do not offset all of the adverse impact. Certain of these strategies also may limit our opportunities in a declining commodity price environment. If these costs increase, it could have an adverse impact on our operating results in the foreseeable future. See Part I - Item 1A, "Risk Factors - Increases in the costs and restrictions on the availability of raw materials, energy, commodities and product components could adversely affect our financial performance," and "- Forward-Looking Statements" below.
We have commodity price risk with respect to purchases of certain raw materials, including steel, copper, diesel fuel, chemicals, resins and leather. Our main cost exposures relate to steel, copper and leather. The majority of the steel used in our products is comprised of fabricated components that are integrated into a seat system, such as seat frames, recliner mechanisms, seat tracks and other mechanical components. Therefore, our exposure to changes in steel prices is primarily indirect, through these purchased components. Approximately 92% of our copper purchases and a significant portion of our leather purchases are subject to price index agreements with our customers and suppliers.
For further information related to the financial instruments described above, see Note 16, "Financial Instruments," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
Other Matters
Legal and Environmental Matters
We are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings and claims, including, without limitation, commercial and contractual disputes, product liability claims and environmental and other matters. As of December 31, 2021, we had recorded reserves for pending legal disputes, including commercial disputes and other matters, of $20 million. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, we had recorded reserves for product liability and warranty claims and environmental matters of $46 million and $8 million, respectively. Although these reserves were determined in accordance with GAAP, the ultimate outcomes of these matters are inherently uncertain, and actual results may differ significantly from current estimates. For a description of risks related to various legal proceedings and claims, see Part I - Item 1A, "Risk Factors." For a more complete description of our outstanding material legal proceedings, see Note 14, "Commitments and Contingencies," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Certain of our accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions are based on our historical experience, the terms of existing contracts, our evaluation of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and suppliers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. However, these estimates and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Accordingly, actual results in these areas may differ significantly from our estimates.
We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate would have had a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Revenue Recognition and Sales Commitments
We enter into contracts with our customers to provide production parts generally at the beginning of a vehicle's life cycle. Typically, these contracts do not provide for a specified quantity of products, but once entered into, we are often expected to fulfill our customers' purchasing requirements for the production life of the vehicle. Many of these contracts may be terminated by our customers at any time. Historically, terminations of these contracts have been infrequent. We receive purchase orders from our customers, which provide the commercial terms for a particular production part, including price (but not quantities). Contracts may also provide for annual price reductions over the production life of the vehicle, and prices may be adjusted on an ongoing basis to reflect changes in product content/cost and other commercial factors.
Revenue is recognized at the point in time when control of the product is transferred to the customer under standard commercial terms, as we do not have an enforceable right to payment prior to such transfer. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those products based on the annual purchase orders, annual price reductions and ongoing price adjustments. Our customers pay for products received in accordance with payment terms that are customary within the industry. Our contracts with our customers do not have significant financing components. We record a contract liability for advances received from our customers.
Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling costs are included in net sales in the consolidated statements of income. Shipping and handling costs are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income.
Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction that we collect from a customer are excluded from revenue.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans
We provide certain pension and other postretirement benefits to our employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement health care benefits and other postretirement benefits.
Approximately 6% of our active workforce is covered by defined benefit pension plans. Pension plans provide benefits based on plan-specific benefit formulas as defined by the applicable plan documents. Postretirement benefit plans generally provide for the continuation of medical benefits for eligible retirees. We also have contractual arrangements with certain employees which provide for supplemental retirement benefits. In general, our policy is to fund our pension benefit obligation based on legal requirements, tax and liquidity considerations and local practices. We do not fund our postretirement benefit obligation.
Plan assets and obligations are measured using various actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, rate of compensation increase, mortality rates, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates, which are determined as of the current year measurement date. The measurement of net periodic benefit cost is based on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase, which are determined as of the prior year measurement date. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and modify these assumptions when appropriate. As required by GAAP, the effects of the modifications are recorded currently or are amortized over future periods.
The determination of the discount rate is generally based on an index created from a hypothetical bond portfolio consisting of high-quality fixed income securities with durations that match the timing of expected benefit payments. Changes in the selected discount rate could have a material impact on the projected benefit obligations, unfunded status and related net periodic benefit cost of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
The expected return on plan assets is determined based on several factors, including adjusted historical returns, historical risk premiums for various asset classes and target asset allocations within the portfolio. Adjustments made to the historical returns are based on recent return experience in the equity and fixed income markets and the belief that deviations from historical returns are likely over the relevant investment horizon.
Key assumptions are shown below:
(1) Forecasted.
The sensitivity to a 100 basis point ("bp") decrease in the discount rate and expected return on plan assets is shown below (in millions):
For further information related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans, see "- Liquidity and Financial Condition - Capitalization - Contractual Obligations" above and Note 10, "Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes in accordance with GAAP. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
Our current and future provision for income taxes is impacted by the initial recognition of and changes in valuation allowances in certain countries. We intend to maintain these allowances until it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our future provision for income taxes will include no tax benefit with respect to losses incurred and, except for certain jurisdictions, no tax expense with respect to income generated in these countries until the respective valuation allowances are eliminated. Accordingly, income taxes are impacted by changes in valuation allowances and the mix of earnings among jurisdictions. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. In completing this evaluation, we consider all available evidence in order to determine whether, based on the weight of the evidence, a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets is necessary. Such evidence includes historical results, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and expectations for future taxable income (exclusive of the reversal of temporary differences and carryforwards),
as well as the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. If, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded.
As of December 31, 2021, we had a valuation allowance related to tax loss and credit carryforwards and other deferred tax assets of $25 million in the United States and $382 million in several international jurisdictions. If operating results improve or decline on a continual basis in a particular jurisdiction, our decision regarding the need for a valuation allowance could change, resulting in either the initial recognition or reversal of a valuation allowance in that jurisdiction, which could have a significant impact on income tax expense in the period recognized and subsequent periods. In determining the provision for income taxes for financial statement purposes, we make certain estimates and judgments, which affect our evaluation of the carrying value of our deferred tax assets, as well as our calculation of certain tax liabilities.
The calculation of our gross unrecognized tax benefits and liabilities includes uncertainties in the application of, and changes in, complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize tax benefits and liabilities based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these benefits and liabilities based on changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties and the impact of tax audits, the ultimate resolutions may differ significantly from our estimates.
For further information, see "- Forward-Looking Statements" below and Note 9, "Income Taxes," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. During 2021, there were no material changes in the methods or policies used to establish estimates and assumptions. Other matters subject to estimation and judgment include amounts related to accounts receivable realization, inventory obsolescence, asset impairments, useful lives of fixed and intangible assets, unsettled pricing discussions with customers and suppliers, restructuring accruals, deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income taxes, pension and other postretirement benefit plan assumptions, accruals related to litigation, warranty and environmental remediation costs and self-insurance accruals. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
For information on the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 17, "Accounting Pronouncements," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 10, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.
Revenue recognition
Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the Company's sales contracts with its customers may provide for annual price reductions over the production life of the vehicle. Prices may also be adjusted on an ongoing basis to reflect changes in product content, product cost and other commercial factors. Some of these price adjustments are non-routine in nature. The amount of revenue recognized by the Company reflects the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for its products based on annual purchase orders, annual price reductions and ongoing price adjustments.
Auditing the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for certain of its products which are subject to non-routine price adjustments is highly judgmental as it relates to evaluating the sufficiency of evidence available from commercial negotiations to support the ultimate consideration that the Company is entitled to in exchange for those products.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We identified and tested controls over the identification and evaluation of product sales with non-routine price adjustments, including management's review of the evidence to support the Company's measurement of revenue related to those product sales.
Our audit procedures included, among others, inspecting communications between the Company and its customers related to the pricing arrangements, auditing adjustments at period-end related to those product sales, performing retrospective reviews of management's estimates to identify contrary evidence, if any, and performing inquiries of and obtaining written representations from executives, within the Company, responsible for the respective customer relationships.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Lear Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Lear Corporation and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Lear Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2021 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 10, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Lear Corporation and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(1) Basis of Presentation
Lear Corporation ("Lear," and together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the "Company") and its affiliates design and manufacture automotive seating and electrical distribution systems and related components. The Company's main customers are automotive original equipment manufacturers. The Company operates facilities worldwide.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Lear, a Delaware corporation, and the wholly owned and less than wholly owned subsidiaries controlled by Lear.
(2) Current Operating Environment
In 2020, unprecedented industry disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the Company's operations in every region of the world. Production disruptions continued in 2021 largely due to the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly through supply shortages. The most significant supply shortage relates to semiconductor chips, which impacted global vehicle production and resulted in reductions and cancellations of planned production. In addition, the Company experienced increased costs related to labor shortages and inefficiencies and ongoing costs related to personal protective equipment, all of which are likely to continue for a period of time. Increases in certain commodity costs, as well as transportation and logistics costs, are also impacting, and will continue to impact, the Company's operating results for the foreseeable future. Further, a resurgence of the COVID-19 virus or its variants, including corresponding "stay at home" or similar government orders impacting industry production, could impact the Company's financial results.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect estimates and assumptions made by management as of December 31, 2021, and for the year then ended. Such estimates and assumptions affect, among other things, the Company's goodwill; long-lived asset and indefinite-lived intangible asset valuations; inventory valuations; valuations of deferred income taxes and income tax contingencies; and credit losses related to the Company's financial instruments. Events and circumstances arising after December 31, 2021, including those resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, will be reflected in management's estimates and assumptions in future periods.
For more information related to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, inventory and credit losses, see Note 3, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." For more information related to income taxes, see Note 3, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Income Taxes," and Note 9, "Income Taxes."
(3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Consolidation
Lear consolidates all entities, including variable interest entities, in which it has a controlling financial interest. Investments in affiliates in which Lear does not have control, but does have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for under the equity method (Note 6, "Investments in Affiliates and Other Related Party Transactions").
Fiscal Period Reporting
The Company's annual financial results are reported on a calendar year basis, and quarterly interim results are reported using a thirteen week reporting calendar.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with original maturities of ninety days or less. Restricted cash includes cash that is legally restricted as to use or withdrawal.
Accounts Receivable
The Company records accounts receivable as title is transferred to its customers. The Company's customers are the world's major automotive manufacturers. Generally, the Company does not require collateral for its accounts receivable.
On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments," using a modified retrospective approach. The standard amends several aspects of the measurement of credit losses related to certain financial instruments, including the
Lear Corporation and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
replacement of the existing incurred credit loss model and other models with the current expected credit losses model. The cumulative effect of adoption resulted in an increase of $0.8 million in the allowance for credit loss and a corresponding decrease in retained earnings as of January 1, 2020.
The Company's allowance for credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost, primarily accounts receivable, reflects management's estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of such assets, measured primarily using historical experience, as well as current conditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Expected credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as changes to expected credit losses during the period, are recognized in earnings. The Company also considers geographic and segment specific risk factors in the development of expected credit losses. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, accounts receivable are reflected net of reserves of $35.5 million and $35.3 million, respectively. Changes in expected credit losses were not significant during the year ended December 31, 2021.
The Company receives bank notes from its customers, which are classified as other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets, for certain amounts of accounts receivable, primarily in Asia. The Company may hold such bank notes until maturity, exchange them with suppliers to settle liabilities or sell them to third-party financial institutions in exchange for cash.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Finished goods and work-in-process inventories include material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs. The Company records reserves for inventory in excess of production and/or forecasted requirements and for obsolete inventory in production and service inventories. A summary of inventories is shown below (in millions):
Engineering and Development ("E&D") and Tooling Costs
In 2021, the Company incurred E&D costs of $608.5 million, including $327.3 million (or 2% of related sales) in its Seating segment, $267.7 million (or 6% of related sales) in its E-Systems segment and $13.5 million at its headquarters location.
Pre-Production Costs Related to Long-Term Supply Agreements
The Company incurs pre-production E&D and tooling costs related to the products produced for its customers under long-term supply agreements. The Company expenses all pre-production E&D costs for which reimbursement is not contractually guaranteed by the customer. In addition, the Company expenses all pre-production tooling costs related to customer-owned tools for which reimbursement is not contractually guaranteed by the customer or for which the Company does not have a non-cancelable right to use the tooling.
During 2021 and 2020, the Company capitalized $298.3 million and $229.7 million, respectively, of pre-production E&D costs for which reimbursement is contractually guaranteed by the customer. During 2021 and 2020, the Company also capitalized $164.4 million and $174.0 million, respectively, of pre-production tooling costs related to customer-owned tools for which reimbursement is contractually guaranteed by the customer or for which the Company has a non-cancelable right to use the tooling. These amounts are included in other current and long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. During 2021 and 2020, the Company collected $448.0 million and $354.6 million, respectively, of cash related to E&D and tooling costs.
Lear Corporation and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
The classification of recoverable customer E&D and tooling costs related to long-term supply agreements is shown below (in millions):
Other E&D Costs
Costs incurred in connection with product launches, to the extent not recoverable from the Company's customers, are recorded in cost of sales as incurred and totaled $139.5 million, $135.0 million and $138.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
All other E&D costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred and totaled $170.7 million, $192.3 million and $178.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Costs associated with the repair and maintenance of the Company's property, plant and equipment are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with improvements which extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the efficiency or safety of the Company's property, plant and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life of the related asset. Depreciable property is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, using principally the straight-line method as follows:
Buildings and improvements 10 to 40 years
Machinery and equipment 5 to 10 years
A summary of property, plant and equipment is shown below (in millions):
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, depreciation expense was $500.6 million, $474.0 million and $447.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, capital expenditures recorded in accounts payable totaled $147.8 million, $118.4 million and $131.6 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2021, property held for sale of $2.6 million and $17.5 million in the Company's Seating and E-Systems segments, respectively, was recorded in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The property is expected to be disposed of by sale within the next twelve months.
Impairment of Goodwill
Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. Impairment testing is required more often than annually if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. In conducting its annual impairment testing, the Company may first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is required. If it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, the Company then compares the fair value of the reporting unit to the related net book value. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recognized.
The Company utilizes an income approach to estimate the fair value of each of its reporting units and a market valuation approach to further support this analysis. The income approach is based on projected debt-free cash flow which is discounted to
Lear Corporation and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
the present value using discount factors that consider the timing and risk of cash flows. The Company believes that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit's expected long-term operating cash flow performance. This approach also mitigates the impact of cyclical trends that occur in the industry. Fair value is estimated using recent automotive industry and specific platform production volume projections, which are based on both third-party and internally developed forecasts, as well as commercial and discount rate assumptions. The discount rate used is the value-weighted average of the Company's estimated cost of equity and of debt ("cost of capital") derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics. The Company's weighted average cost of capital is adjusted by reporting unit to reflect a risk factor, if necessary. Other significant assumptions include terminal value growth rates, terminal value margin rates, future capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements. While there are inherent uncertainties related to the assumptions used and to management's application of these assumptions to this analysis, the Company believes that the income approach provides a reasonable estimate of the fair value of its reporting units. The market valuation approach is used to further support the Company's analysis and is based on recent transactions involving comparable companies.
The annual goodwill impairment assessment is completed as of the first day of the Company's fourth quarter. The Company performed a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit. The qualitative assessments indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value.
A summary of the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for each of the periods in the two years ended December 31, 2021, is shown below (in millions):
Intangible Assets
As of December 31, 2021, intangible assets consist primarily of certain intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisitions of Guilford Mills in 2012, the parent company of Eagle Ottawa, LLC in 2015, AccuMED Holdings Corp. in 2016, Grupo Antolin's automotive seating business in 2017 and Xevo Inc. ("Xevo") in 2019 (Note 4, "Acquisitions"). These intangible assets were recorded at their estimated fair value, based on independent appraisals, as of the transaction or acquisition date. The value assigned to technology intangibles is based on the royalty savings method, which applies a hypothetical royalty rate to projected revenues attributable to the identified technologies. Royalty rates were determined based primarily on analysis of market information. The customer-based intangible asset includes the acquired entity's established relationships with its customers and the ability of these customers to generate future economic profits for the Company. The value assigned to customer-based intangibles is based on the present value of future earnings attributable to the asset group after recognition of required returns to other contributory assets.
A summary of intangible assets as of December 31, 2021, is shown below (in millions):
The Company recognized an impairment charge of $8.5 million related to certain intangible assets of its E-Systems segment resulting from a change in the intended use of the assets. The impairment charge is included in amortization of intangible assets in the accompanying statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Lear Corporation and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
Intangible assets with a gross carrying value of $7.5 million became fully amortized in 2021 and are no longer included in the gross carrying value or accumulated amortization as of December 31, 2021.
A summary of intangible assets as of December 31, 2020, is shown below (in millions):
Intangible assets with a gross carrying value of $25.6 million became fully amortized in 2020 and are no longer included in the gross carrying value or accumulated amortization as of December 31, 2020.
Excluding the impact of any future acquisitions, the Company's estimated annual amortization expense for the five succeeding years is shown below (in millions):
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company monitors its long-lived assets for impairment indicators on an ongoing basis in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). If impairment indicators exist, the Company performs the required impairment analysis by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets to the related net book values. If the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. An impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the long-lived assets. Fair value estimates of property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets are based on independent appraisals, giving consideration to the highest and best use of the assets. Key assumptions used in the appraisals are based on a combination of market and cost approaches, as appropriate.
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized fixed asset impairment charges of $4.2 million, $21.3 million and $8.7 million, respectively, in conjunction with its restructuring actions (Note 5, "Restructuring"). For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized additional asset impairment charges of $7.7 million and $4.6 million, respectively. Asset impairment charges are recorded in cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Impairment of Investments in Affiliates
The Company monitors its investments in affiliates for indicators of other-than-temporary declines in value on an ongoing basis in accordance with GAAP. If the Company determines that an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred, it recognizes an impairment loss, which is measured as the difference between the recorded book value and the fair value of the investment. Fair value is generally determined using an income approach based on discounted cash flows or negotiated transaction values. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized impairment charges of $1.0 million, $4.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively, related to its investments in affiliates.
Lear Corporation and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
Accrued Liabilities
A summary of accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, is shown below (in millions):
Leases
Accounting Policy
The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. For all asset classes, the Company utilizes the short-term lease exemption as provided under GAAP. A short-term lease is a lease that, at the commencement date, has a term of twelve months or less and does not include an option to purchase the underlying asset. For all asset classes, the Company accounts for each lease component of a contract and its associated non-lease components as a single lease component, rather than allocating a standalone value to each component of a lease.
For purposes of calculating operating lease obligations under the standard, the Company's lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such option. The Company's leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms.
Discount Rate
The discount rate used to measure a lease obligation should be the rate implicit in the lease; however, the Company's operating leases generally do not provide an implicit rate. Accordingly, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to determine the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is an entity-specific rate which represents the rate of interest a lessee would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term with similar payments.
Revenue Recognition and Sales Commitments
The Company enters into contracts with its customers to provide production parts generally at the beginning of a vehicle's life cycle. Typically, these contracts do not provide for a specified quantity of products, but once entered into, the Company is often expected to fulfill its customers' purchasing requirements for the production life of the vehicle. Many of these contracts may be terminated by the Company's customers at any time. Historically, terminations of these contracts have been infrequent. The Company receives purchase orders from its customers, which provide the commercial terms for a particular production part, including price (but not quantities). Contracts may also provide for annual price reductions over the production life of the vehicle, and prices may be adjusted on an ongoing basis to reflect changes in product content/cost and other commercial factors.
Revenue is recognized at the point in time when control of the product is transferred to the customer under standard commercial terms, as the Company does not have an enforceable right to payment prior to such transfer. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those products based on the annual purchase orders, annual price reductions and ongoing price adjustments. Revenue recognized related to prior years represented approximately 1% of consolidated net sales during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. The Company's customers pay for products received in accordance with payment terms that are customary within the industry. The Company's contracts with its customers do not have significant financing components.
The Company records a contract liability for advances received from its customers. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no significant contract liabilities recorded. Further, there were no significant contract liabilities recognized in revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Lear Corporation and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling costs are included in net sales in the consolidated statements of income. Shipping and handling costs are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income.
Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction that are collected by the Company from a customer are excluded from revenue.
Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Cost of sales includes material, labor and overhead costs associated with the manufacture and distribution of the Company's products. Distribution costs include inbound freight costs, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, warehousing costs and other costs of the Company's distribution network. Selling, general and administrative expenses include selling, engineering and development and administrative costs not directly associated with the manufacture and distribution of the Company's products.
Restructuring Costs
Restructuring costs include employee termination benefits, asset impairment charges and contract termination costs, as well as other incremental costs resulting from the restructuring actions. Employee termination benefits are recorded based on existing union and employee contracts, statutory requirements, completed negotiations and Company policy. Other incremental costs principally include equipment and personnel relocation costs. In addition to restructuring costs, the Company also incurs incremental manufacturing inefficiency costs at the operating locations impacted by the restructuring actions during the related restructuring implementation period. Restructuring costs are recognized in the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Generally, charges are recorded as restructuring actions are approved and/or implemented.
Other Expense, Net
Other expense, net includes non-income related taxes, foreign exchange gains and losses, gains and losses related to certain derivative instruments and hedging activities, losses on the extinguishment of debt, gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets, gains and losses on the consolidation and deconsolidation of affiliates, the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost and other miscellaneous income and expense. A summary of other expense, net is shown below (in millions):
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The Company's current and future provision for income taxes is impacted by the initial recognition of and changes in valuation allowances in certain countries. The Company intends to maintain these allowances until it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. The Company's future provision for income taxes will include no tax benefit with respect to losses incurred and, except for certain jurisdictions, no tax expense with respect to income generated in these countries until the respective valuation allowances are eliminated. Accordingly, income taxes are impacted by changes in valuation allowances and the mix of earnings among jurisdictions. The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. In completing this evaluation, the Company considers all available evidence in order to determine whether, based on the weight of the evidence, a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets is necessary. Such evidence includes historical results, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and expectations for future taxable income (exclusive of the reversal of temporary differences and carryforwards), as well as the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. If, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the Company's deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded. If operating results improve or decline on a continual basis in a particular jurisdiction, the Company's decision regarding the need for a valuation allowance could change, resulting in either the initial recognition or reversal of a valuation allowance in that jurisdiction, which could have a significant impact on income tax expense in the period recognized and subsequent periods. In determining the provision for income taxes for financial statement
Lear Corporation and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
purposes, the Company makes certain estimates and judgments, which affect its evaluation of the carrying value of its deferred tax assets, as well as its calculation of certain tax liabilities.
The Company reclassifies taxes from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings as the items to which the tax effects relate are similarly reclassified.
The calculation of the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits and liabilities includes uncertainties in the application of, and changes in, complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across its global operations. The Company recognizes tax benefits and liabilities based on its estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company adjusts these benefits and liabilities based on changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties and the impact of tax audits, the ultimate resolutions may differ significantly from the Company's estimates.
Effective January 1, 2021, ASU 2019-12, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes," simplified the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and amending prior guidance to improve consistent application. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.
Foreign Currency
Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries that use a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using an average of the foreign exchange rates in effect during the period. Translation adjustments that arise from translating a foreign subsidiary's financial statements from the functional currency to the U.S. dollar are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets.
Transaction gains and losses that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, except certain long-term intercompany transactions, are included in the consolidated statements of income as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, other expense, net includes net foreign currency transaction losses of $24.8 million, $19.9 million and $20.6 million, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company measures stock-based employee compensation expense at fair value in accordance with GAAP and recognizes such expense over the vesting period of the stock-based employee awards.
Net Income Per Share Attributable to Lear
Basic net income per share available to Lear common stockholders is computed using the two-class method by dividing net income attributable to Lear, after deducting the redemption adjustment related to redeemable noncontrolling interest, by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Common shares issuable upon the satisfaction of certain conditions pursuant to a contractual agreement are considered common shares outstanding and are included in the computation of basic net income per share available to Lear common stockholders.
Diluted net income per share available to Lear common stockholders is computed using the two-class method by dividing net income attributable to Lear, after deducting the redemption adjustment related to redeemable noncontrolling interest, by the average number of common shares outstanding, including the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents computed using the treasury stock method and the average share price during the period.

Segment Reporting
The Company is organized under two reportable operating segments:
Seating, which consists of the design, development, engineering and manufacture of complete seat systems, seat subsystems and key seat components, and E-Systems, which consists of the design, development, engineering and manufacture of complete electrical distribution and connection systems and electronic systems. Key components in the Company's complete seat system and subsystem solutions are advanced comfort, wellness and safety offerings, as well as configurable seating product technologies. All of these products are compatible with traditional internal combustion engine ("ICE") architectures and the full range of hybrid, plug-in hybrid and battery electric architectures (collectively, "electrified powertrains"). Key seat component product offerings include seat trim covers, surface materials such as leather and fabric, seat mechanisms, seat foam and headrests. Key components in the Company's electrical distribution and connection systems portfolio include wire harnesses, terminals and connectors, and engineered components for both ICE architectures and electrified powertrains that require management of higher voltage and power. Key components in the Company's electronic systems portfolio include body domain control modules and products specific to electrification and connectivity. Electrification products include on-board battery chargers, power conversion modules, high voltage battery management systems and high voltage power distribution systems. Connectivity products include telematics control units ("TCU") and gateway modules to manage both wired and wireless networks and data in vehicles. In addition to electronic modules, the Company offers software that includes cybersecurity, advanced vehicle positioning for automated and autonomous driving applications and full capabilities in both dedicated short-range communication and cellular protocols for vehicle connectivity. The Company's software offerings include embedded control software and cloud and mobile device-based software and services. The other category includes unallocated costs related to corporate headquarters, regional headquarters and the elimination of intercompany activities, none of which meets the requirements for being classified as an operating segment. Corporate and regional headquarters costs include various support functions, such as information technology, advanced research and development, corporate finance, legal, executive administration and human resources.
Each of the Company's operating segments reports its results from operations and makes its requests for capital expenditures directly to the chief operating decision maker. The economic performance of each operating segment is driven primarily by automotive production volumes in the geographic regions in which it operates, as well as by the success of the vehicle platforms for which it supplies products. Also, each operating segment operates in the competitive Tier 1 automotive supplier environment and is continually working with its customers to manage costs and improve quality. The Company's production processes generally make use of hourly labor, dedicated facilities, sequential manufacturing and assembly processes and commodity raw materials.
Lear Corporation and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based primarily on (i) revenues from external customers, (ii) pretax income before equity in net income of affiliates, interest expense and other expense ("segment earnings") and (iii) cash flows, being defined as segment earnings less capital expenditures plus depreciation and amortization.
The accounting policies of the Company's operating segments are the same as those described in this note to the consolidated financial statements.
Derivative Instruments and Hedge Activities
The Company has used derivative financial instruments, including forwards, futures, options, swaps and other derivative contracts, to reduce the effects of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates and the resulting variability of the Company's operating results. The Company is not a party to leveraged derivatives. The Company's derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting arrangements that provide for the net settlement of contracts, by counterparty, in the event of default or termination. On the date that a derivative contract for a hedge instrument is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as either (1) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (a fair value hedge), (2) a hedge of the exposure of a forecasted transaction or of the variability in the cash flows of a recognized asset or liability (a cash flow hedge), (3) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (a net investment hedge) or (4) a contract not designated as a hedge instrument.
For a fair value hedge, the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in earnings and reflected in the consolidated statements of income on the same line as the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For a cash flow hedge, the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets. When the underlying hedged transaction is realized, the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive loss is recorded in earnings and reflected in the consolidated statements of income on the same line as the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For a net investment hedge, the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in cumulative translation adjustment, which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets. When the related currency translation adjustment is required to be reclassified, usually upon the sale or liquidation of the investment, the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive loss is recorded in earnings and reflected in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of income. Changes in the fair value of contracts not designated as hedge instruments are recorded in earnings and reflected in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of income. Cash flows attributable to derivatives used to manage foreign currency risks are classified on the same line as the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Upon settlement, cash flows attributable to derivatives designated as net investment hedges are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash flows attributable to forward starting interest rate swaps are classified as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
The Company formally documents its hedge relationships, including the identification of the hedge instruments and the related hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction. Derivatives are recorded at fair value in other current and long-term assets and other current and long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company also formally assesses whether a derivative used in a hedge transaction is highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or the cash flows of the hedged item. When it is determined that a hedged transaction is no longer probable to occur, the Company discontinues hedge accounting.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. During 2021, there were no material changes in the methods or policies used to establish estimates and assumptions. Other matters subject to estimation and judgment include amounts related to accounts receivable realization, inventory obsolescence, asset impairments, useful lives of fixed and intangible assets and unsettled pricing negotiations with customers and suppliers (Note 3, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"); acquisitions (Note 4, "Acquisitions"); restructuring accruals (Note 5, "Restructuring"); deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income taxes (Note 9, "Income Taxes"); pension and other postretirement benefit plan assumptions (Note 10, "Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans"); accruals related to litigation, warranty and environmental remediation costs (Note 14, "Commitments and Contingencies"); and self-insurance accruals. Actual results may differ significantly from the Company's estimates.

In 2019, the Company completed a U.S. research and development ("R&D") tax credit study for the years 2013 to 2018, the results of which were accepted by the Internal Revenue Service and pursuant to which the Company recognized a tax benefit of $28.6 million. The tax benefit is reflected in the table above in research and development and other tax credits.
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, income in foreign jurisdictions with tax holidays was $55.6 million, $29.4 million and $89.4 million, respectively. Such tax holidays generally expire from 2021 through 2036.
Deferred income taxes represent temporary differences in the recognition of certain items for financial reporting and income tax purposes. A summary of the components of the net deferred income tax asset is shown below (in millions):
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the valuation allowance with respect to the Company's deferred tax assets was $406.9 million and $397.7 million, respectively, a net increase of $9.2 million.
Concluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence, such as cumulative losses in recent years, which is objective and verifiable. When measuring cumulative losses in recent years, the

Company uses a rolling three-year period of pretax book income, adjusted for permanent differences between book and taxable income and certain other items. As of December 31, 2021, the Company continues to maintain a U.S. valuation allowance of $24.5 million, primarily related to U.S. state and local deferred tax assets that, due to their nature, are not likely to be realized. In addition, the Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance of $382.4 million with respect to its deferred tax assets in several international jurisdictions.
The classification of the net deferred income tax asset is shown below (in millions):
As of December 31, 2021, deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries since these earnings will not be taxable upon repatriation to the United States. These earnings will be primarily treated as previously taxed income from either the one-time transition tax or GILTI, or they will be offset with a 100% dividend received deduction. However, the Company continues to provide a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding tax that will be incurred with respect to the undistributed foreign earnings that are not permanently reinvested.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had tax loss carryforwards of $1.7 billion. Of the total tax loss carryforwards, $1.4 billion have no expiration date, and $253.0 million expire between 2022 and 2038. In addition, the Company had tax credit carryforwards of $266.4 million, comprised principally of U.S. foreign tax credits of $103.7 million that expire between 2027 and 2031, U.S. research and development credits of $119.3 million that expire between 2025 and 2041 and other tax credits primarily in international jurisdictions of $43.4 million that generally expire between 2022 and 2041.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits were $34.9 million and $36.4 million (excluding interest and penalties), respectively, which is recorded in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, all of the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits would affect the Company's effective tax rate.
A summary of the changes in gross unrecognized tax benefits is shown below (in millions):
The Company recognizes interest and penalties with respect to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had recorded gross reserves of $12.7 million and $12.2 million, respectively, related to interest and penalties, all of which, if recognized, would affect the Company's effective tax rate.
The Company operates in multiple jurisdictions throughout the world, and its tax returns are periodically audited or subject to review by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that, as a result of audit settlements, the conclusion of current examinations and the expiration of the statute of limitations in multiple jurisdictions, the Company may decrease the amount of its gross unrecognized tax benefits by $3.9 million, all of which, if recognized, would affect the Company's effective tax rate. The gross unrecognized tax benefits subject to potential decrease involve issues related to transfer pricing and various other tax items in multiple jurisdictions. However, as a result of ongoing examinations, tax proceedings in certain countries, additions to the gross unrecognized tax benefits for positions taken and interest and penalties, if any, arising in 2022, it is not possible to estimate the potential net increase or decrease to the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months.
The Company considers its significant tax jurisdictions to include China, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Morocco, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. The Company or its subsidiaries generally remain subject to income tax examination in certain U.S. state and local jurisdictions for years after 2016. Further, the Company or its subsidiaries remain subject to income tax examination in Spain for years after 2007, in Mexico for years after 2013, in Germany and Italy for years after 2015, in China

and Morocco for years after 2017, in the United Kingdom for years after 2018 and in the United States generally for years after 2019.
Other
In 2021, the Brazilian Supreme Court ruled on certain matters, including the method of determining the amount of indirect tax credits that taxpayers are entitled to monetize in future periods. As a result of the ruling, other expense, net includes a gain of $45.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, for which $8.0 million of tax expense was recognized.
(10) Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans
The Company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic employees and certain employees in foreign countries, principally Canada. The Company's salaried pension plans provide benefits based on final average earnings formulas. The Company's hourly pension plans provide benefits under flat benefit and cash balance formulas. The Company also has contractual arrangements with certain employees which provide for supplemental retirement benefits. In general, the Company's policy is to fund its pension benefit obligation based on legal requirements, tax and liquidity considerations and local practices.
The Company has postretirement benefit plans covering certain domestic and Canadian retirees. The Company's postretirement benefit plans generally provide for the continuation of medical benefits for eligible retirees. The Company does not fund its postretirement benefit obligation. Rather, payments are made as costs are incurred by covered retirees.
Obligation

Actuarial losses
As of December 31, 2021, the decrease in pension and other postretirement benefit obligations attributable to actuarial gains primarily relates to an increase in the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligations (see assumptions below).
As of December 31, 2020, the increase in pension and other postretirement benefit obligations attributable to actuarial losses primarily relates to a decrease in the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligations (see assumptions below) and, to a lesser extent, changes in mortality assumptions for the Company's U.S. plans. With respect to the other postretirement benefit obligation, actuarial losses were offset by gains related to claims cost updates for the Company's foreign plans.

In addition, the Company recognized tax benefit (expense) in other comprehensive income (loss) related to its defined benefit plans of ($22.7) million, $18.5 million and $13.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Pretax amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss not yet recognized in net periodic benefit cost as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, are shown below (in millions):
The Company uses the corridor approach when amortizing actuarial gains and losses. Under the corridor approach, net unrecognized actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of i) the projected benefit obligation or ii) the fair value of plan assets are amortized over future periods. For plans with little to no active participants, the amortization period is the remaining average life expectancy of the participants. For plans with active participants, the amortization period is the remaining average service period of the active participants. The amortization periods range from 4 to 32 years for the Company's defined benefit pension plans and from 1 to 17 years for the Company's other postretirement benefit plans.

Assumptions
The weighted average actuarial assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations are shown below:
Lear Corporation and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
The weighted average actuarial assumptions used in determining the net periodic benefit cost (credit) are shown below:
The expected return on plan assets is determined based on several factors, including adjusted historical returns, historical risk premiums for various asset classes and target asset allocations within the portfolio. Adjustments made to the historical returns are based on recent return experience in the equity and fixed income markets and the belief that deviations from historical returns are likely over the relevant investment horizon.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the weighted-average interest crediting rate used by one of the Company's U.S. pension plans was a minimum of 4.0%.

Plan Assets
Fair value measurements and the related valuation techniques and fair value hierarchy level for the Company's pension plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, are shown below (in millions):
Lear Corporation and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
For further information on the GAAP fair value hierarchy, see Note 16, "Financial Instruments." Pension plan assets for the foreign plans relate to the Company's pension plans primarily in Canada and the United Kingdom.
The Company's investment policies incorporate an asset allocation strategy that emphasizes the long-term growth of capital. The Company believes that this strategy is consistent with the long-term nature of plan liabilities and ultimate cash needs of the plans. For the domestic portfolio, the Company targets a return seeking asset (e.g., equity securities, equity mutual funds and exchange traded funds ("ETFs") and alternative investments) allocation of 45% - 65% and a risk mitigating asset (e.g., fixed income securities and fixed income mutual funds and ETFs) allocation of 35% - 55%. As the funding ratio for the defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic employees changes, the proportion of return seeking assets will be adjusted accordingly. For the foreign portfolio, the Company targets an equity allocation of 20% - 60% of plan assets, a fixed income allocation of 30% - 70%, an alternative investment allocation of 0% - 25% and a cash allocation of 0% - 15%. Differences in the target allocations of the domestic and foreign portfolios are reflective of differences in the underlying plan liabilities. Diversification within the investment portfolios is pursued by asset class and investment management style. The investment portfolios are reviewed on a quarterly basis to maintain the desired asset allocations, given the market performance of the asset classes and investment management styles. Alternative investments are redeemable in the near term, generally with 90 days notice.
The Company utilizes investment management firms to manage these assets in accordance with the Company's investment policies. Excluding alternative investments, mutual funds and ETFs, retained investment managers are provided investment guidelines, which restrict the use of certain assets, including commodities contracts, futures contracts, options, venture capital, real estate, interest-only or principal-only strips and investments in the Company's own debt or equity. Derivative instruments
Lear Corporation and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
are also prohibited without the specific approval of the Company. Investment managers are limited in the maximum size of individual security holdings and the maximum exposure to any one industry relative to the total portfolio. Fixed income managers are provided further investment guidelines that indicate minimum credit ratings for debt securities and limitations on weighted average maturity and portfolio duration.
The Company evaluates investment manager performance against market indices which the Company believes are appropriate to the investment management style for which the investment manager has been retained. The Company's investment policies incorporate an investment goal of aggregate portfolio returns which exceed the returns of the appropriate market indices by a reasonable spread over the relevant investment horizon.
Contributions
In 2022, the Company's minimum required contributions to its domestic and foreign pension plans are expected to be approximately $2 million. The Company may elect to make contributions in excess of minimum funding requirements in response to investment performance or changes in interest rates or when the Company believes that it is financially advantageous to do so and based on its other cash requirements. After 2022, the Company's minimum funding requirements will depend on several factors, including investment performance and interest rates. The Company's minimum funding requirements may also be affected by changes in applicable legal requirements.
Benefit Payments
As of December 31, 2021, the Company's estimate of expected benefit payments in each of the five succeeding years and in the aggregate for the five years thereafter are shown below (in millions):
Multi-Employer Pension Plans

Labor-Management Group Pension Plan (EIN 51-6099782-001) and UNITE Here National Retirement Fund (EIN 13-6130178-001), for certain of its employees. Contributions to these plans are based on four collective bargaining agreements, which expire between June 30, 2022 and April 25, 2025.
Detailed information related to these plans is shown below (amounts in millions):
(1) Funding improvement plan or rehabilitation plan as defined by Employment Retirement Security Act of 1974.
For its plan years 2021 and 2020, the Company's contributions to the U.A.W. Labor-Management Group Pension Plan represented more than 5% of the plan's total contributions.
Defined Contribution Plan
The Company also sponsors defined contribution plans and participates in government-sponsored programs in certain foreign countries. Contributions are determined as a percentage of each covered employee's salary. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate cost of the defined contribution plans was $16.4 million, $17.1 million and $14.0 million, respectively.
Lear Corporation and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
The Company also has a defined contribution retirement program for its salaried employees.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest
In accordance with GAAP, the Company records redeemable noncontrolling interests at the greater of (1) the initial carrying amount adjusted for the noncontrolling interest holder's share of total comprehensive income or loss and dividends ("noncontrolling interest carrying value") or (2) the redemption value as of and based on conditions existing as of the reporting date. Required redeemable noncontrolling interest adjustments are recorded as an increase to redeemable noncontrolling interests, with an offsetting adjustment to retained earnings. The redeemable noncontrolling interest is classified in mezzanine equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019.
In 2020, the noncontrolling interest holder in Shanghai Lear STEC Automotive Parts Co., Ltd. exercised its option requiring the Company to purchase its 45% redeemable noncontrolling interest.

(14) Commitments and Contingencies
Legal and Other Contingencies
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had recorded reserves for pending legal disputes, including commercial disputes and other matters, of $19.5 million and $17.2 million, respectively. Such reserves reflect amounts recognized in accordance with GAAP and typically exclude the cost of legal representation. Product liability and warranty reserves are recorded separately from legal reserves, as described below.
Commercial Disputes
The Company is involved from time to time in legal proceedings and claims, including, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes with its customers, suppliers and competitors. These disputes vary in nature and are usually resolved by negotiations between the parties.
Product Liability and Warranty Matters
In the event that use of the Company's products results in, or is alleged to result in, bodily injury and/or property damage or other losses, the Company may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims. Such lawsuits generally seek compensatory damages, punitive damages and attorneys' fees and costs. In addition, if any of the Company's products are, or are alleged to be, defective, the Company may be required or requested by its customers to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such products. Certain of the Company's customers have asserted claims against the Company for costs related to recalls or other corrective actions involving its products. The Company can provide no assurances that it will not experience material claims in the future or that it will not incur significant costs to defend such claims.
To a lesser extent, the Company is a party to agreements with certain of its customers, whereby these customers may pursue claims against the Company for contribution of all or a portion of the amounts sought in connection with product liability and warranty claims.
In certain instances, allegedly defective products may be supplied by Tier 2 suppliers. The Company may seek recovery from its suppliers of materials or services included within the Company's products that are associated with product liability and warranty claims. The Company carries insurance for certain legal matters, including product liability claims, but such coverage may be limited. The Company does not maintain insurance for product warranty or recall matters.
The Company records product warranty reserves when liability is probable and related amounts are reasonably estimable.
A summary of the changes in reserves for product liability and warranty claims for each of the periods in the two years ended December 31, 2021, is shown below (in millions):
Environmental Matters
The Company is subject to local, state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances, which govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects and which impose liability for clean-up costs resulting from past spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous wastes and environmental compliance. The Company's policy is to comply with all applicable environmental laws and to maintain an environmental management program based on ISO 14001 to ensure compliance with this standard. However, the Company currently is, has been and in the future may become the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or procedures.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had recorded environmental reserves of $8.0 million and $8.9 million, respectively. The Company does not believe that the environmental liabilities associated with its current and former properties
Lear Corporation and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
will have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows; however, no assurances can be given in this regard.
Other Matters
The Company is involved from time to time in various other legal proceedings and claims, including, without limitation, intellectual property matters, tax claims and employment matters. Although the outcome of any legal matter cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that any of the other legal proceedings or claims in which the Company is currently involved, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, no assurances can be given in this regard.
Although the Company records reserves for legal disputes, product liability and warranty claims and environmental and other matters in accordance with GAAP, the ultimate outcomes of these matters are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ significantly from current estimates.
Employees
Approximately 48% of the Company's employees are members of industrial trade unions and are employed under the terms of various labor agreements. Labor agreements covering approximately 86% of the Company's global unionized workforce of approximately 77,500 employees, including labor agreements in the United States and Canada covering approximately 3% of the Company's global unionized workforce, are scheduled to expire in 2022. Management does not anticipate any significant difficulties with respect to the renewal of these agreements.

(16) Financial Instruments
Debt Instruments
The carrying values of the Notes vary from their fair values. The fair values of the Notes were determined by reference to the quoted market prices of these securities (Level 2 input based on the GAAP fair value hierarchy). The carrying value of the Company's Term Loan Facility approximates its fair value (Level 3 input based on the GAAP fair value hierarchy). The estimated fair value, as well as the carrying value, of the Company's debt instruments are shown below (in millions):
(1) Excludes "other" debt.
(2) Excludes the impact of unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized original issue premium (discount).
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
The Company has cash on deposit that is legally restricted as to use or withdrawal. A reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents reported on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows is shown below (in millions):
Marketable Equity Securities
Marketable equity securities, which the Company accounts for under the fair value option, are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as shown below (in millions):
Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the marketable equity securities are recognized in other expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The fair value of the marketable equity securities is determined by reference to quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1 input based on the GAAP fair value hierarchy).
Equity Securities Without Readily Determinable Fair Values
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values of $15.4 million and $11.2 million, respectively, are included in other long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Such investments are valued at cost, less cumulative impairments and adjusted for changes resulting from observable, orderly transactions for identical or similar securities. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized impairment charges of $1.0 million, $4.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively, and investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values have been reduced for cumulative impairments of $10.0 million and $9.0 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
Foreign Exchange
The Company uses forwards, swaps and other derivative contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on known foreign currency exposures. Gains and losses on the derivative instruments are intended to offset gains and losses on the hedged transaction in an effort to reduce exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The principal currencies hedged by the Company include the Mexican peso, various European currencies, the Chinese renminbi, the Japanese yen, the Philippine peso and the Thai baht.
Foreign currency derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments consist principally of hedges of cash transactions, intercompany loans and certain other balance sheet exposures.
Net Investment Hedges
The Company uses cross-currency interest rate swaps which are designated as net investment hedges of the foreign currency rate exposure of its investment in certain Euro-denominated subsidiaries. Contra interest expense on net investment hedges was $6.5 million, $6.5 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and is included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
Balance Sheet Classification

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, pretax net gains (losses) of ($16.1) million and $4.7 million, respectively, related to the Company's derivative instruments and hedge activities were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
During the next twelve month period, net gains (losses) expected to be reclassified into earnings are shown below (in millions):
Such gains and losses will be reclassified at the time that the underlying hedged transactions are realized.
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized tax benefit (expense) of $7.5 million, ($0.8) million and ($5.5) million, respectively, in other comprehensive income related to its derivative instruments and hedge activities.
Fair Value Measurements
GAAP provides that fair value is an exit price, defined as a market-based measurement that represents the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value measurements are based on one or more of the following three valuation techniques:
Market: This approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.
Income: This approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amount based on current market expectations.
Cost: This approach is based on the amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost).
Further, GAAP prioritizes the inputs and assumptions used in the valuation techniques described above into a three-tier fair value hierarchy as follows:
Level 1: Observable inputs, such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date.
Level 2: Inputs, other than quoted market prices included in Level 1, that are observable either directly or indirectly for the asset or liability.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the entity's own assumptions about the exit price of the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs may be used if there is little or no market data for the asset or liability at the measurement date.
Lear Corporation and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
The Company discloses fair value measurements and the related valuation techniques and fair value hierarchy level for its assets and liabilities that are measured or disclosed at fair value.
Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Fair value measurements and the related valuation techniques and fair value hierarchy level for the Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, are shown below (in millions):
The Company determines the fair value of its derivative contracts using quoted market prices to calculate the forward values and then discounts such forward values to the present value. The discount rates used are based on quoted bank deposit or swap interest rates. If a derivative contract is in a net liability position, the Company adjusts these discount rates, if required, by an estimate of the credit spread that would be applied by market participants purchasing these contracts from the Company's counterparties. If an estimate of the credit spread is required, the Company uses significant assumptions and factors other than quoted market rates, which would result in the classification of its derivative liabilities within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no derivative contracts that were classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. In addition, there were no transfers in or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during 2021 and 2020.
For further information on fair value measurements and the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets, see Note 10, "Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans."
Items Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis
The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis, which are not included in the table above. As these non-recurring fair value measurements are generally determined using unobservable inputs, these fair value measurements are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
In 2020 and 2019, the Company completed quantitative goodwill impairment analyses for selected reporting units (Note 3, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Impairment of Goodwill"). The Level 3 fair value estimate of the reporting units was based on a third-party valuation and/or management's estimates, using a combination of the discounted cash flow method and guideline public company method.
In 2019, as a result of the Xevo acquisition (Note 4, "Acquisitions"), Level 3 fair value estimates of $90.1 million related to intangible assets are recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The estimated fair values of these assets were based on third-party valuations and management's estimates, generally utilizing the income and cost approaches.
In 2019, as a result of the deconsolidation of GACC (Note 6, "Investments in Affiliates and Other Related Party Transactions"), the Company is accounting for its investment in GACC under the equity method. The Level 3 fair value estimate related to the Company's equity interest was based on the present value of future cash flows and reflects a discount for the lack of control and the lack of marketability associated with equity interests.
Fair value estimates of property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets were based on independent appraisals, giving consideration to the highest and best use of the assets. Key assumptions used in the appraisals were based on a combination of market and cost approaches, as appropriate.
Lear Corporation and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
Fair value estimates of customer-based and licensing intangible assets were based on the present value of future earnings attributable to the asset group after recognition of required returns to other contributory assets. Fair value estimates of developed technology intangible assets were based on management's estimates using a discounted cash flow method.
Fair value estimates of noncontrolling and equity interests were based on the present value of future cash flows and a value to earnings multiple approach and reflect discounts for the lack of control and the lack of marketability associated with noncontrolling and equity interests.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no additional significant assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.
(17) Accounting Pronouncements

Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes." See Note 3, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Income Taxes."
