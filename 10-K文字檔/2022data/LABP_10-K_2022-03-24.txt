Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes.
Company Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of oral therapeutics for patients with autoimmune diseases. We believe we were the first to identify and target LANCL2, NLRX1 and PLXDC2, which are immunometabolic pathways or targets. Our core expertise is the discovery of novel pathways at the interface of immunity and metabolism. Based on our understanding of the role that cellular metabolic pathways have on modulating inflammatory responses, we aim to inhibit these inflammatory responses by changing the metabolic processes in target cells. We leverage our proprietary advanced artificial intelligence-based integrated computational and experimental precision medicine platform, our LANCE platform, to identify novel therapeutic targets based on predictions of immunometabolic function. We then identify and create novel therapeutic candidates to engage those novel targets in areas of unmet medical need. We have identified seven novel immunometabolic pathways or targets. Our near-term focus is on our clinical-stage programs including omilancor for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, or UC, NX-13 for the treatment of UC, and LABP-104 for the potential treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE, and rheumatoid arthritis, or RA. We believe the therapeutics we discover and develop, if approved, could have a significant positive impact on the quality of life of patients suffering from autoimmune diseases.
Our lead product candidate, omilancor, is a gut-restricted oral therapeutic that is the first product candidate designed to engage the novel target lanthionine synthetase C-like protein 2, or LANCL2, a membrane receptor that has been shown to modulate immunological mechanisms that are associated with autoimmune diseases such as UC. We are developing omilancor as a once-daily oral treatment initially for UC. We expect to initiate a Phase 2b trial of omilancor for the treatment of moderate-to-severe UC patients before the end of 2022.
NX-13 is a novel, gut-restricted oral therapeutic that targets NOD-like receptor X1, or NLRX1, a mitochondria-associated receptor that has been associated with the modulation of inflammatory cytokines for UC. NX-13 is designed to target NLRX1 and induce anti-inflammatory effects in CD4+ T cells and other immune cells in the gastrointestinal tract. We are developing NX-13 as a once-daily oral treatment for UC. We are currently conducting a Phase 1b trial of NX-13 in moderate UC patients and expect to report topline results in mid-2022. We expect to announce the timing for the initiation of a Phase 2 trial of NX-13 in moderate to severe UC patients later this year.
LABP-104 is a novel, systemically bioavailable, oral therapeutic that targets LANCL2. We are developing LABP-104 as a once-daily oral treatment for SLE and/or RA. The pathogenesis of SLE is connected to defective apoptosis leading to stimulation of B cells by dendritic cells and CD4+ T cells to produce auto-antibodies. These antibodies activate the complement system and deposit in organs, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. We believe the activation of LANCL2 can intercept these events upstream through skewing of CD4+ T cells to regulatory phenotypes and maintenance of the metabolic requirements for autophagy. We are currently conducting a Phase 1a trial of LABP-104 in healthy volunteers and expect topline results to be reported in mid-2022. We expect to announce the timing for the initiation of a Phase 2 trial of LABP-104 in patients later this year.
In May 2021, we entered into an exclusive collaboration and license agreement, or the LianBio Agreement, with LianBio Respiratory Limited, or LianBio, pursuant to which we granted LianBio an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize OMILANCOR and NX-13 in Greater China (mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau), South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, Cambodia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, or the Territory. We received an upfront cash payment of $18.0 million in connection with the execution of the LianBio Agreement and are eligible to receive development milestone payments of up to $95.0 million and sales milestone payments of up to $105.0 million. We are also eligible to receive tiered low-double-digit royalties based on net sales of OMILANCOR and NX-13 in the Territory, subject to reductions in specified circumstances.
We have a limited operating history. Since inception, our operations have focused on developing our clinical and preclinical product candidates and our LANCE platform, organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, establishing our intellectual property portfolio and conducting clinical trials and preclinical studies. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities.
Since our inception in 2017, we have funded operations through the issuance of convertible preferred stock and convertible promissory notes, through proceeds from our initial public offering, or IPO, and through the upfront payment from a license and collaboration agreement with a related party. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $94.2 million and we expect to incur substantial operating losses for at least the next several years. As such, we will need to raise additional capital to initiate and complete our planned clinical trials, to continue and expand our research and development operations that support our planned discovery, development and clinical and regulatory activities, and to adequately prepare for commercialization of our product candidates that may achieve regulatory approval in the future. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $90.9 million, which we believe will be sufficient to fund our planned operations into the second half of 2023. We anticipate that our expenses may increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:
•conduct our ongoing and planned clinical trials of omilancor, NX-13, and LABP-104, as well as initiate and complete additional clinical trials;
•pursue regulatory approval of our product candidates;
•seek to discover and develop additional clinical and preclinical product candidates;
•scale up our clinical and regulatory capabilities;
•establish a commercialization infrastructure and scale up external manufacturing and distribution capabilities to commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval;
•adapt our regulatory compliance efforts to incorporate requirements applicable to marketed products;
•maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•hire additional clinical, manufacturing and scientific personnel;
•add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts; and
•incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company.
Components of our Results of Operations
Revenue - License Fee
We recognize revenue under our collaboration agreement with LianBio, which we entered into in May 2021.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with our research activities, including our discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, and include:
•salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and other related costs for personnel engaged in research and development functions;
•expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including contract research organizations, or CROs, and other third parties that conduct research, preclinical activities and clinical trials on our behalf, as well as contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, that manufacture drug material for use in our clinical trials and preclinical studies;
•costs of outside consultants, including their fees, and related travel expenses;
•the costs of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical and clinical trial supplies; and
•allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.
We expense research and development costs as incurred. We track external development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs or other internal costs to specific development programs or product candidates.
Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have a higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase in the future and will comprise a larger percentage of our total expenses as we progress and complete our ongoing clinical trials, initiate new clinical trials, continue to discover and develop additional product candidates and prepare regulatory filings for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials.
The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot determine with certainty the duration and costs of our existing and future clinical trials of our product candidates or any other product candidate we may develop or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. We may never succeed in obtaining marketing approval for any product candidate. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates and any other product candidate we may develop in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including:
•per patient trial costs;
•the number of patients who enroll in each trial;
•the number of trials required for approval;
•the number of sites included in the trials;
•the countries in which the trials are conducted;
•the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;
•the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;
•potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies;
•the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up;
•the phase of development of the product candidate; and
•the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate.
Our expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties and we may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates. We may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials. We may elect to discontinue, delay, or modify clinical trials of our product candidates. A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in our clinical trials due to patient enrollment or other reasons, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in our executive, finance, business development and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters, professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services; insurance costs, travel expenses and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.
We expect that our general and administrative expenses will decrease in the foreseeable future, however, in the long term will increase as we increase our personnel headcount to support an expanded infrastructure, including the development of a commercialization infrastructure for any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Our expenditures are subject to uncertainties, including the terms and timing of regulatory approvals, and the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending, and enforcing any patent claims or other intellectual property rights.
Interest and Other Income (Expense), net
Other income, net, primarily consists of interest income received from available-for-sale marketable securities.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Revenue - License Fee
In May 2021, we entered into the LianBio Agreement to develop and commercialize omilancor and NX-13 in Greater China and select Asian markets. We recognized the $18.0 million upfront payment under the collaboration as revenue
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses were $41.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $16.3 million was primarily attributed to the clinical activities towards the advancement of our omilancor and NX-13 programs, as well as increases in employee-related expenses resulting from increased headcount.
The following table summarizes our research and development expenses by product candidate or development program for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $10.0 million was primarily attributable to increases in D&O insurance costs and other costs associated with becoming a public company in 2021, as well as increases in employee-related expenses resulting from increased headcount.
Interest and Other Income, net
Interest and other income, net, was $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to other expense, net of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease of $0.1 million was due to lower interest rates earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance the preclinical and clinical development of our research programs and product candidates. As a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain from additional equity or debt financings, collaborations, licensing arrangements, or other sources.
We do not currently have any approved products and have never generated any revenue from product sales. To date, we have financed our operations through the issuance of convertible preferred stock and convertible promissory notes, proceeds from our IPO, and the upfront payment from the LianBio Agreement. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $90.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and an accumulated deficit of $94.2 million. We had no indebtedness as of December 31, 2021.
The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below:
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $27.1 million, consisting primarily of our net loss of $38.4 million as we incurred expenses associated with research activities for our lead product candidates and incurred general and administrative expenses. Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $23.0 million, consisting primarily of our net loss of $30.1 million as we incurred expenses associated with research activities for our lead product.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $58.7 million, consisting of purchases of available-for-sale marketable securities and property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $14.1 million, consisting of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities partially offset by purchases of available-for-sale marketable securities.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2021 of $91.6 million was primarily related to the net proceeds received from our IPO. Net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2020 of $1.5 million was related to proceeds from exercise of stock options.
Funding Requirements
To date, we have not generated any revenues from the commercial sale of approved drug products, and we do not expect to generate substantial revenue for at least the next few years. If we fail to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner or fail to obtain their regulatory approval, our ability to generate future revenue will be compromised. We do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue from our product candidates, and we do not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of, and commercialize, our product candidates. Further, we do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue
under the LianBio Agreement as future payments are conditioned upon the achievement of development and commercialization milestones that are uncertain as of this date. We expect our expenses to proportionately increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the research and development of, continue or initiate clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for, our product candidates. In addition, if we obtain approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. We anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.
Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes many years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of product candidates that we do not expect to be commercially available in the near term, if at all.
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2023. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be imprecise, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical drugs, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the amount of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•the scope, progress, costs and results of our ongoing and planned clinical trials of omilancor, NX-13 and LABP-104;
•the costs and results of discovery work using our LANCE platform;
•the scope, progress, costs and results of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for any future product candidates we may decide to pursue;
•the extent to which we in-license or acquire rights to other products, product candidates or technologies;
•the costs and timing of process development and manufacturing scale-up activities associated with our product candidates and other programs as we advance them through preclinical and clinical development;
•the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we may pursue;
•the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;
•the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
•the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
•our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other agreements and the financial terms of such agreements; and
•the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights, and defending against any intellectual property-related claims.
Further, our operating results may change in the future, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plans.
Our future commercial revenue, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for several years, if at all. Until such time, if ever, that we can generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaboration agreements, other third-party funding, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and marketing and distribution arrangements. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders
will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of existing stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through other third-party funding, collaboration agreements, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this prospectus, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition for Out-License Arrangements
To date, all of our revenue has been generated from the LianBio Agreement. We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or Topic 606. Under Topic 606, we recognize revenue when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration, if any; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation.
At contract inception and through December 31, 2021, we determined that the LianBio Agreement contains a single performance obligation to deliver the License, which represents functional intellectually property given the functionality of the License is not expected to change substantially as a result of the Company’s ongoing activities.
We determined that the upfront fixed payment of $18.0 million is the initial transaction price. The potential development milestone payments that we are eligible to receive upon the successful achievement of certain regulatory approvals or activities were excluded from the initial transaction price, as the milestone amounts were fully constrained based on the probability of achievement. The royalties and sales milestone payments are excluded from the transaction price under the sales- or usage-based royalty exception of ASC 606. We will reevaluate the transaction price, including all constrained amounts, at the end of each reporting period and as uncertain events are resolved or other changes in circumstances occur, and we will adjust our estimate of the transaction price as necessary. We will recognize the royalties and sales milestone payments as revenue when the associated sales occur,
and relevant sales-based thresholds are met. As of December 31, 2021, we had completed the transfer of the License and know-how necessary and, as such, recognized the full $18.0 million upfront payment as revenue.
Research and Development Expenses
The majority of our operating expenses to date have been incurred in research and development activities. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our accrued research and development expenses at each consolidated balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing purchase orders and open contracts, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each consolidated balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments as necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by CROs with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.
We base our expenses related to research and development activities on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation expense represents the grant date fair value of employee stock option and award grants recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the awards (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures. We estimate the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, the expected dividend yield of our common stock, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock and the expected term of the option. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for information concerning certain of the specific assumptions we used in applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of our employee stock options granted for all periods presented.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly because our cash is held in interest-bearing money market accounts. Due to the short- term maturities of our cash equivalents and the low risk profile of our investments, an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our cash equivalents.
Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and clinical trial costs. We do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
A description of recent accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows is disclosed in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status
We qualify as an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended, or JOBS Act. As an “emerging growth company” we may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:
•not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended;
•not being required to comply with any requirements that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the consolidated financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);
•reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and
•exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
We may take advantage of these provisions until December 31, 2026. However, if any of the following events occur prior to that date, (i) our annual gross revenue exceeds $1.07 billion, (ii) we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period or (iii) we become a “large accelerated filer,” (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), we will cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such five-year period. We will be deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” at such time that we (a) have an aggregate worldwide market value of common equity securities held by non-affiliates of $700.0 million or more as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, (b) have been required to file annual and quarterly reports under the Exchange Act, for a period of at least 12 months and (c) have filed at least one annual report pursuant to the Exchange Act.
In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period.
We are also a “smaller reporting company,” meaning that the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million and our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company, we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.
