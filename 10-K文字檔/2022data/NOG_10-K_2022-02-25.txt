Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes to financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. See Item 7., “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is incorporated herein by reference, for discussion and analysis of results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Executive Overview
Our primary strategy is to invest in non-operated minority working and mineral interests in oil and gas properties, with a core area of focus in the premier basins within the United States. Using this strategy, we had participated in 7,436 gross (680.8 net) producing wells as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we had leased approximately 245,431 net acres, of which approximately 87% were developed and all were located in the United States.
Our average daily production for full year 2021 was 53,792 Boe per day, and in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 64,155 Boe per day (approximately 59% oil). This represented significant growth from 2020, which was driven in large part by three substantial acquisitions that we completed during 2021: the Reliance Acquisition, the CM Resources Acquisition and the Comstock Acquisition, each as defined and described in Note 3 to our financial statements (collectively, the “2021 Acquisitions”).
During 2021, we added 35.8 new net wells to production, plus an additional 169.4 net wells added from acquisitions which were already producing when acquired. We ended 2021 with 42.5 net wells in process.
Our financial and operating performance for the year ended December 31, 2021 included the following:
•Oil and natural gas sales of $975.1 million in 2021
•Cash flows from operations of $396.5 million in 2021
•Proved reserves of 287.7 MMBoe at December 31, 2021, as estimated by our third-party reserve engineers under SEC guidelines
•Grew and diversified the business through over $400 million in substantial bolt-on acquisitions in multiple basins, conservatively financed through a combination of debt and equity
•Initiated a shareholder return program in the form of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, which started at $0.03 per share for the second quarter of 2021 and grew to $0.08 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021
•Reduced outstanding indebtedness from $949.8 million at December 31, 2020 to $805.0 million at December 31, 2021
•Issued $750.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2028 and $438.1 million in common stock (net of offering expenses), the proceeds of which were used (i) to fund our 2021 Acquisitions and in preparation for the Veritas Acquisition, (ii) to retire $417.8 million of term debt with near-term maturities, (iii) to repay revolving credit facility borrowings, allowing us to exit 2021 with $704.5 million in liquidity, and (iv) for general corporate purposes
Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic and Economic Environment
The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and efforts to mitigate the spread of the disease have created unprecedented challenges for our industry, including a drastic decline in demand for crude oil. This, combined with OPEC actions in early 2020, led to spot and future prices of crude oil falling to historic lows during the second quarter of 2020 and remaining depressed through much of 2020. Operators in the Williston Basin responded by significantly decreasing drilling and completion activity, and by shutting in or curtailing production from a significant number of producing wells. Conditions have significantly improved with the recovery and rally of commodity prices from late 2020 through the end of 2021, but operators’ decisions on these matters are evolving rapidly, and it remains difficult to predict the future effects on our company
and its business. However, we expect that our cash flow from operations and borrowing availability under our Revolving Credit Facility will allow us to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve 12 months.
Source of Our Revenues
We derive our revenues from the sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from our properties. Revenues are a function of the volume produced, the prevailing market price at the time of sale, oil quality, Btu content and transportation costs to market. We use derivative instruments to hedge future sales prices on a substantial, but varying, portion of our oil and natural gas production. We expect our derivative activities will help us achieve more predictable cash flows and reduce our exposure to downward price fluctuations. The use of derivative instruments has in the past, and may in the future, prevent us from realizing the full benefit of upward price movements but also mitigates the effects of declining price movements.
Principal Components of Our Cost Structure
•Commodity price differentials. The price differential between our well head price for oil and the NYMEX WTI benchmark price is primarily driven by the cost to transport oil via train, pipeline or truck to refineries. The price differential between our well head price for natural gas and NGLs and the NYMEX Henry Hub benchmark price is primarily driven by gathering and transportation costs.
•Gain (loss) on commodity derivatives, net. We utilize commodity derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil and gas. Gain (loss) on commodity derivatives, net is comprised of (i) cash gains and losses we recognize on settled commodity derivatives during the period, and (ii) non-cash mark-to-market gains and losses we incur on commodity derivative instruments outstanding at period-end.
•Production expenses. Production expenses are daily costs incurred to bring oil and natural gas out of the ground and to the market, together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties. Such costs also include field personnel compensation, salt water disposal, utilities, maintenance, repairs and servicing expenses related to our oil and natural gas properties.
•Production taxes. Production taxes are paid on produced oil and natural gas based on a percentage of revenues from products sold at market prices (not hedged prices) or at fixed rates established by federal, state or local taxing authorities. We seek to take full advantage of all credits and exemptions in our various taxing jurisdictions. In general, the production taxes we pay correlate to the changes in oil and natural gas revenues.
•Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion. Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion includes the systematic expensing of the capitalized costs incurred to acquire, explore and develop oil and natural gas properties. As a full cost company, we capitalize all costs associated with our development and acquisition efforts and allocate these costs to each unit of production using the units-of-production method. Accretion expense relates to the passage of time of our asset retirement obligations.
•General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses include overhead, including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff, costs of maintaining our headquarters, costs of managing our acquisition and development operations, franchise taxes, audit and other professional fees and legal compliance.
•Interest expense. We finance a portion of our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and acquisitions with borrowings. As a result, we incur interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions. We capitalize a portion of the interest paid on applicable borrowings into our unproven cost pool. We include interest expense that is not capitalized into the full cost pool, the amortization of deferred financing costs and bond premiums (including origination and amendment fees), commitment fees and annual agency fees as interest expense.
•Impairment expense. Under the full cost method of accounting, the Company is required to perform a ceiling test each quarter. The test determines a limit, or ceiling, on the book value of the proved oil and gas properties. If the net book value, including related deferred taxes, exceeds the ceiling, a non-cash impairment expense is required.
•Income tax expense. Our provision for taxes includes both federal and state taxes. We record our federal income taxes in accordance with accounting for income taxes under GAAP which results in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax
rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.
Selected Factors That Affect Our Operating Results
Our revenues, cash flows from operations and future growth depend substantially upon:
•the timing and success of drilling and production activities by our operating partners;
•the prices and the supply and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs;
•the quantity of oil and natural gas production from the wells in which we participate;
•changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments we use to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of oil;
•our ability to continue to identify and acquire high-quality acreage and drilling opportunities; and
•the level of our operating expenses.
In addition to the factors that affect companies in our industry generally, the location of substantially all of our acreage and wells in the Williston, Appalachian and Permian Basins subjects our operating results to factors specific to these regions. These factors include the potential adverse impact of weather on drilling, production and transportation activities, particularly during the winter and spring months, as well as infrastructure limitations, transportation capacity, regulatory matters and other factors that may specifically affect one or more of these regions.
The price of oil can vary depending on the market in which it is sold and the means of transportation used to transport the oil to market, particularly in the Williston Basin where a substantial majority of our revenues are derived. Additional pipeline infrastructure has increased takeaway capacity in the Williston Basin which has improved wellhead values in the region.
The price at which our oil production is sold typically reflects a discount to the NYMEX benchmark price. The price at which our natural gas production is sold may reflect either a discount or premium to the NYMEX benchmark price. Thus, our operating results are also affected by changes in the oil price differentials between the applicable benchmark and the sales prices we receive for our oil production. Our oil price differential to the NYMEX benchmark price during 2021 was $5.15 per barrel, as compared to $6.63 per barrel in 2020. Our net realized gas price during 2021 was $4.57 per Mcf, representing 100% realization relative to average Henry Hub pricing, compared to a net realized gas price of $1.14 per Mcf during 2020. Fluctuations in our price differentials and realizations are due to several factors such as gathering and transportation costs, takeaway capacity relative to production levels, regional storage capacity, and seasonal refinery maintenance temporarily depressing demand.
Another significant factor affecting our operating results is drilling costs. The cost of drilling wells can vary significantly, driven in part by volatility in commodity prices that can substantially impact the level of drilling activity. Generally, higher oil prices have led to increased drilling activity, with the increased demand for drilling and completion services driving these costs higher. Lower oil prices have generally had the opposite effect. In addition, individual components of the cost can vary depending on numerous factors such as the length of the horizontal lateral, the number of fracture stimulation stages, and the type and amount of proppant. During 2021, the weighted average authorization for expenditure (or AFE) cost for wells we elected to participate in was $6.9 million, compared to $7.5 million for the wells we elected to participate in during 2020.
Market Conditions
The price that we receive for the oil and natural gas we produce is largely a function of market supply and demand. Because our oil and gas revenues are heavily weighted toward oil, we are more significantly impacted by changes in oil prices than by changes in the price of natural gas. World-wide supply in terms of output, especially production from properties within the United States, the production quota set by OPEC, and the strength of the U.S. dollar can adversely impact oil prices.
Historically, commodity prices have been volatile and we expect the volatility to continue in the future. Factors impacting the future oil supply balance are world-wide demand for oil, as well as the growth in domestic oil production.
Prices for various quantities of natural gas, NGLs and oil that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows. The following table lists average NYMEX prices for oil and natural gas for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
________________________
(1)Based on average NYMEX closing prices.
The average 2021 NYMEX oil pricing was $68.09 per barrel of oil or 74% higher than the average NYMEX price per barrel in 2020. Our settled derivatives decreased our realized oil price per barrel by $10.17 in 2021 and increased our realized oil price per barrel by $20.08 in 2020. Our average 2021 realized oil price per barrel after reflecting settled derivatives was $52.77 compared to $52.69 in 2020. The average 2021 NYMEX natural gas pricing was $3.84 per Mcf, or 91% higher than the average NYMEX price per Mcf in 2020. Our settled derivatives decreased our realized natural gas price per Mcf by $0.92 in 2021 and increased our realized natural gas price per Mcf by $0.02 in 2020. Our 2021 realized gas price per Mcf was $3.65 compared to $1.16 in 2020, which was primarily driven by higher NYMEX pricing for natural gas and gas realizations, which was partially offset by decrease in settled derivatives.
We employ a hedging program that mitigates the risk associated with fluctuations in commodity prices. For detailed information on our commodity hedging program, see
