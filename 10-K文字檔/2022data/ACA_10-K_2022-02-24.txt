Company Overview
Arcosa, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, (“Arcosa,” “Company,” “we,” or “our”) headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is a provider of infrastructure-related products and solutions with leading brands serving construction, engineered structures, and transportation markets in North America. Arcosa is a Delaware corporation and was incorporated in 2018 in connection with the separation (the “Separation”) of Arcosa from Trinity Industries, Inc. (“Trinity” or “Former Parent”) on November 1, 2018 as an independent, publicly-traded company, listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Potential Impact of COVID-19 on our Business
Our highest priority is the health and safety of our employees and communities. We are committed to safety across our operations. Our businesses support critical infrastructure sectors and our plants have continued to operate throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. If one or more of Arcosa’s facilities become subject to governmental ordered closure, voluntary temporary closure, closure from a COVID-19 outbreak within the facility, or other COVID-19 related reason the business, liquidity and financial condition, and results of operations for Arcosa could be adversely affected.
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global trade, commerce, financial and credit markets, and daily life throughout the world. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, liquidity and financial condition, and results of operations will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals’ actions taken in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity, and actions taken in response; the effect on our customers and customer demand for our products and services; our ability to sell and provide our products and services; if key personnel are unable to perform their duties or have limited availability; the number of employees who contract or are directly exposed to COVID-19 and their availability to work in our plants and facilities; the ability to retain employees; the ability of our customers to pay for our products and services; any disruption in our supply chain; the ability to procure personal protective equipment; the availability of COVID-19 testing supplies; our ability to continue operations in compliance with COVID-19 related regulations; any closures of our and our customers’ facilities; increased cybersecurity and IT infrastructure risks; the impact on the health and safety of our employees; the impact on the demand for commodities served by our products and services; the impact of new COVID-19 variants; and the pace of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, as well as, the response to a potential reoccurrence.
We strive to continuously improve our procedures, processes, and management systems regarding employee health and safety. The continuance of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical importance of focusing on the health and wellness of our employees. We have followed the federal, state, and local guidelines governing our facilities and shared best practices across the organization, with the goal of protecting our employees and communities. We continue to monitor and implement guidelines and best practices for COVID-19 mitigation procedures.
In addition to the extensive health and safety protocols already in place across our plants, we estimate that we are incurring less than $1 million per quarter of incremental costs related to COVID-19 for personal protective equipment, health screenings, deep cleaning services, and facilities re-configurations. We do not anticipate that the enhanced health and safety protocols will have a material impact on the productivity of our plants.
The preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. At this time, we have not observed any material impairments of our assets or a significant change in the fair value of assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, due to the factors discussed above, we are unable to determine or predict the overall impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources.
Market Outlook
•Within our Construction Products segment, we have experienced better than anticipated construction demand since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic as construction activity in Texas has remained resilient, when seasonal weather conditions have been normal, and other states have reopened for business. We did experience a softening of demand for our specialty materials and shoring products businesses beginning in 2020 following the outbreak. Our shoring products business and lightweight aggregates business within specialty materials recovered to pre-pandemic demand levels in 2021, while other areas of specialty materials have shown signs of improvement. The outlook for public and private construction activity has improved as expectations for U.S. economic growth have increased following the roll-out of vaccines and associated re-opening of the economy, but the environment continues to be uncertain.
•Within our Engineered Structures segment, our backlog as of December 31, 2021 provides a healthy level of production visibility into 2022. Our customers remain committed to taking delivery of these orders. In utility structures, order and inquiry activity continues to be strong, as customers remain focused on grid hardening and reliability initiatives. The demand outlook for traffic and telecom structures also remains positive. In the third quarter, we received wind tower orders of $174 million providing a base level of production visibility for 2022. Long-term expectations for the wind industry are favorable; however, uncertainty pertaining to the level of PTC support and high steel prices are negatively impacting near-term expectations. In the fourth quarter, we idled our Clinton, Illinois wind tower facility in anticipation of lower volumes in 2022. Order and inquiry activity in the storage tank business is very strong, after taking a pause initially at the onset of COVID-19 as certain customers deferred new tank installations.
•Within our Transportation Products segment, our backlog for inland barges as of December 31, 2021 is $92.7 million, approximately 73% lower than the backlog level at first quarter 2020 during the onset of the pandemic and provides a low base level of production visibility into 2022. Our customers remain committed to taking delivery of these orders. Barge order levels fell sharply in the second and third quarters of 2020 at the onset of the pandemic and remained low throughout 2021. Utilization levels and market conditions for our liquid barge customers improved throughout 2021 as demand for refined products improved, U.S. refinery utilization rates increased, and oil prices recovered, but remained below pre-pandemic levels. The underlying fundamentals for a dry barge replacement cycle remain in place as the fleet continues to age, new builds have not kept pace with scrapping, and utilization rates are high. However, a sharp and sustained increase in steel prices since the end of 2020 negatively impacted new order levels in 2021 and the near-term outlook for dry barge demand. To align with lower expected production levels in 2022, we have reduced our capacity in our two active barge operating plants and completed the idling of our Madisonville, Louisiana facility in the fourth quarter of 2021 to further reduce our cost structure. We continue to remain flexible to allow time for fundamentals to recover. Demand for steel components, which was softening pre-COVID-19 due to a weakening North American rail transportation market, remains depressed but is showing early signs of recovery as the outlook for the new railcar market is improving.
Executive Overview
Financial Operations and Highlights
•Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased 5.2% to $2.0 billion compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 due to higher revenues in Construction Products and Engineered Structures partially offset by decreased volumes in Transportation Products.

•Revenues from our Construction Products segment increased primarily due to the impact of the Cherry acquisition.
•In our Engineered Structures segment, revenues increased primarily driven by higher volumes in utility structures and sales from our acquired traffic and telecom structures businesses.
•Revenues from our Transportation Products segment increased primarily due to higher hopper barge deliveries partially offset by lower tank barge deliveries and decreased deliveries and lower contractual pricing for steel components.
Operating Costs
Operating costs are comprised of cost of revenues; selling, general, and administrative expenses; impairment charges; and gains or losses on property disposals.
2021 versus 2020
•Operating costs increased 8.1%.
•Cost of revenues for Construction Products increased primarily due to higher volumes from acquired businesses, including the cost impact of the fair market value write-up of acquired inventory and additional depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense.
•Cost of revenues for Engineered Structures increased primarily due to higher volumes in our utility structures business, as well as higher steel prices.
•Cost of revenues for Transportation Products decreased primarily due to lower volumes in our inland barge business.
•Depreciation, depletion, and amortization increased primarily due to the acquisition of StonePoint and other recent acquisitions, including the fair value mark up of long-lived assets.
•As a percentage of revenue, selling, general, and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 12.6% compared to 11.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is largely due to additional costs from acquired businesses in Construction Products and higher corporate costs due to a legal settlement in the fourth quarter and higher acquisition-related transaction and integration costs.

For a further discussion of revenues, costs, and the operating results of individual segments, see Segment Discussion below.
Other Income and Expense
Other, net (income) expense consists of the following items:
•Other, net expense due to foreign currency exchange transactions increased by $2.1 million in 2020 primarily driven by the volatility in the U.S. dollar to Mexican peso exchange rate throughout 2020 which largely stabilized in 2021.
Income Taxes
The income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $14.0 million, $31.6 million, and $33.5 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was 16.7%, 22.9%, and 22.8%, respectively. The effective tax rates differ from the federal tax rate of 21.0% due to the impact of state income taxes, excess tax benefits related to equity compensation, and the impact of foreign tax benefits. The reduction in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was largely due to true-ups of apportionment rates impacting prior year state current and deferred taxes. For a reconciliation of the federal tax rate to our effective tax rate, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 27, 2020 the U.S. Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), which includes certain tax relief and benefits that may impact the Company. Approximately $15 million of federal and state income tax payments deferred during the first half of 2020 were paid during the third quarter of 2020. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has deferred $5.4 million in payroll-related taxes in accordance with the provisions of the CARES Act that we expect to pay during the year ended December 31, 2022.
See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of income taxes.
Segment Discussion
Construction Products
2021 versus 2020
•Revenues increased 34.2% primarily due to StonePoint and other recent acquisitions, which on a combined basis increased segment revenues by approximately 25%. The additional increase in revenues was driven by strong demand for construction aggregates despite numerous weather-related challenges in the first half of the year, partially offset by reduced shipments to oil and gas markets. Revenues from our trench shoring business increased 32.7%, above pre-pandemic levels, due to higher steel prices and improved demand conditions as COVID-related construction delays improved.
•Cost of revenues increased 38.7% due to higher volumes from the acquired businesses and strong demand in our legacy businesses. Cost of revenues also increased due to a $4.7 million increase in the amortization of the fair value mark up of acquired inventory as well as higher depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense from acquired businesses. As a percent of revenues, cost of revenues in our legacy businesses, excluding depreciation, depletion, and amortization, were mostly in line with the prior year despite higher fuel prices and other inflationary-related increases.
•Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 31.4% due to additional costs from acquired businesses. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general, and administrative costs in the legacy businesses declined as legacy costs were substantially unchanged from the previous year.
•Operating profit increased by 11.4%, driven by increased volumes in the second half of the year which offset the impact of Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter, and excessive rainfall in the second quarter. Excluding the impact of the fair value mark up of acquired inventory and the impairment charge recognized in the prior year, operating profit increased approximately 15%.
•Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense increased primarily due to StonePoint and other recently acquired businesses along with the associated fair value mark up of acquired long-lived assets.
2020 versus 2019
•Revenues increased 35.0%, driven by the acquisition of Cherry, which increased segment revenues by approximately 40%. This was partially offset by a decrease of 14.4% in revenues in our trench shoring business as a result of lower volumes as customers reduced capital expenditures during the COVID-19 crisis. In our legacy aggregates and specialty materials businesses, revenues were mostly flat as reduced volumes in plants serving oil and gas markets and from COVID-19 related construction delays were mostly offset by increased aggregates volumes serving other markets.
•Cost of revenues increased 31.4%, primarily due to higher volumes from the acquired Cherry business. As a percent of revenues, cost of revenues decreased to 75.8% compared to 77.8%.
•Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 52.7% primarily due to additional costs from the acquired Cherry business. Selling, general, and administrative costs in the legacy businesses were lower than the previous period.
•Operating profit increased 41.7% outpacing the increase in revenues.
•Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense increased primarily due to the acquired Cherry business.
Engineered Structures
2021 versus 2020
•Revenues increased 6.4% due to increased pricing across all product lines due to higher steel prices, higher volumes in utility structures, and the full year impact of the acquired traffic and telecom structures businesses. Revenue increases were partially offset by lower wind tower volumes due, in part, to the temporary idling of a facility earlier in the year. Revenues also increased due to the recognition of $7.7 million of revenue in the second quarter related to a one-time resolution of a customer dispute from 2019 in our wind towers business. The associated towers were removed from backlog in 2020 and we continue to have a good commercial relationship with this customer.
•Cost of revenues increased 6.6% driven by higher steel prices and increased volumes in our utility structures, partially offset by lower wind tower volumes. Cost of revenues were reduced by a gain of $3.9 million recognized on the sale of a non-operating facility in the first quarter.
•Selling, general, and administrative expenses were substantially unchanged.
•Operating profit increased by 9.7% primarily due to increased volumes in our utility structures business and improved margins in our storage tank and utility structures businesses, a one-time resolution of a customer dispute, and the gain on the sale of a non-operating facility. This increase was partially offset by lower wind tower volumes and Winter Storm Uri that impacted production in our Texas and Oklahoma plants for approximately one week in the first quarter.
2020 versus 2019
•Revenues increased 4.9%, driven primarily by higher volumes in utility structures and sales from our acquired traffic and telecom structures businesses, partially offset by lower steel prices in utility structures and reduced volumes and pricing in our wind towers and storage tank businesses. The lower volumes in our wind towers business was partially due to a temporary idling of one of our facilities in the fourth quarter to invest in a planned product changeover.
•Cost of revenues increased 7.6% driven by the acquired traffic and telecom structures businesses, higher volumes in utility structures, product changeover costs in wind towers, and operational challenges in our utility structures business primarily related to COVID-19. This increase was partially offset by lower volumes in our storage tank business.
•Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 13.9% primarily due to additional costs from acquired businesses.
•Operating profit decreased by 20.4% primarily due to the temporary idling of a wind tower facility and operational challenges in our utility structures business related to COVID-19.
Unsatisfied Performance Obligations (Backlog)
As of December 31, 2021, the backlog for utility, wind, and related structures was $437.5 million compared to $334.0 million as of December 31, 2020. Approximately 90% of the unsatisfied performance obligations for our utility, wind, and related structures are expected to be delivered during the year ending December 31, 2022, with the remainder expected to be delivered during the year ended 2023. Future wind tower orders are subject to uncertainty as PTC eligibility for existing wind farm projects is currently in a phase-out period that extends until 2025, and there is currently no PTC in place for new wind farm projects commencing in 2022 or beyond. Pricing of orders and individual order quantities reflect a market transitioning from PTC incentives. As of December 31, 2021, the backlog for our storage tanks in our Engineered Structures segment was $22.0 million, all of which is expected to be delivered during the year ending December 31, 2022.
Transportation Products
2021 versus 2020
•Revenues decreased 34.5%. Revenues from inland barges decreased 43.0% due to lower tank and hopper barge deliveries as demand has weakened from the COVID-19 pandemic and increased steel prices. Steel component revenues increased slightly due to increased deliveries as the North American railcar market shows signs of recovery.
•Cost of revenues decreased by 27.8%, driven by lower barge volumes.
•Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased due to lower compensation costs.
•Operating profit decreased by 88.3% due to lower barge volumes and declines in operational efficiencies from reduced capacity utilization.
2020 versus 2019
•Revenues were substantially unchanged as higher barge revenues, driven by increased hopper deliveries, were offset by lower steel components revenues due to decreased deliveries and lower contractual pricing.
•Cost of revenues decreased 3.2%, primarily due to lower steel component volumes and the elimination of $4.0 million of start-up costs incurred in the prior year related to the re-opening of a previously idled barge manufacturing plant. This was partially offset by higher hopper barge volumes. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues decreased to 82.4% compared to 85.2% in the prior year period primarily due to improved operating efficiencies in our barge business.
•Selling, general, and administrative expenses were substantially unchanged.
•The segment was negatively impacted by a $5.0 million non-cash impairment charge primarily related to unusable non-operating assets that were scrapped from a barge business acquired in 2018.
•Operating profit increased by 16.7%, outpacing the increase in revenues.
Unsatisfied Performance Obligations (Backlog)
As of December 31, 2021, the backlog for inland barges was $92.7 million compared to $175.5 million as of December 31, 2020. All of the backlog for inland barges is expected to be delivered during the year ending December 31, 2022.
Corporate
2021 versus 2020
•Corporate overhead costs increased 21.8% primarily due to an additional $6.9 million of acquisition-related transaction and integration costs as well as a legal settlement of $8.7 million incurred during the fourth quarter of 2021 related to a previously disclosed matter regarding events that pre-dated the Company's spin-off.
2020 versus 2019
•Corporate overhead costs increased 22.0% primarily due higher acquisition-related transaction and integration costs of $4.6 million as well as a non-recurring increase in legal expenses of $2.5 million incurred during the third quarter of 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Arcosa’s primary liquidity requirement consists of funding our business operations, including capital expenditures, working capital investment, and disciplined acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity include cash flow from operations, our existing cash balance, availability under the revolving credit facility, and, as necessary, the issuance of additional long-term debt or equity. To the extent we have available liquidity, we may also consider undertaking new capital investment projects, executing additional strategic acquisitions, returning capital to stockholders, or funding other general corporate purposes.

Other Investing and Financing Activities
Revolving Credit Facility and Senior Notes
On January 2, 2020, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to increase the revolving credit facility to $500 million and added a term loan facility of $150 million, in each case with a maturity date of January 2, 2025. The entire term loan was advanced on January 2, 2020 in connection with the closing of the acquisition of Cherry. As of December 31, 2021, the term loan had a remaining balance of $144.4 million.
On August 4, 2021, we borrowed an additional $100 million under our revolving credit facility to fund, in part, the acquisition of Southwest Rock. As of December 31, 2021, we had $125 million of outstanding loans borrowed under the revolving credit facility, and there were approximately $28.6 million of letters of credit issued, leaving $346.4 million available. Of the outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2021, $28.0 million are expected to expire in 2022, with the remainder in 2023. The majority of our letter of credit obligations support the Company’s various insurance programs and generally renew by their terms each year.
The interest rates under the revolving credit facility and term loan are variable based on LIBOR or an alternate base rate plus a margin. A commitment fee accrues on the average daily unused portion of the revolving facility. The margin for borrowing and commitment fee rate are determined based on Arcosa’s leverage as measured by a consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA ratio. The margin for borrowing ranges from 1.25% to 2.00% and was set at LIBOR plus 1.75% as of December 31, 2021. The commitment fee rate ranges from 0.20% to 0.35% and was set at 0.30% at December 31, 2021.
The Company's revolving credit and term loan facilities require the maintenance of certain ratios related to leverage and interest coverage. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. Borrowings under the credit agreement are guaranteed by certain wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company.
In order to increase liquidity in anticipation of the acquisition of StonePoint, the Company entered into an unsecured 364-Day Credit Agreement on March 26, 2021 providing for a revolving line of credit of $150 million, with an outside maturity date of March 25, 2022, with pricing, covenants, and guarantees substantially similar to the Company’s existing revolving credit and term loan facilities. Per the terms of the facility, it terminated on April 6, 2021 upon the closing of the Company’s private offering of $400 million in senior notes.
On April 6, 2021, the Company issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% senior notes (the “Notes”) that mature in April 2029. Interest on the Notes is payable semiannually commencing October 2021. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries that is a guarantor under our revolving credit and term loan facilities.
We believe, based on our current business plans, that our existing cash, available liquidity, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund necessary capital expenditures and operating cash requirements for the foreseeable future. The Company further believes that its financial resources will allow it to manage the anticipated impact of COVID-19 on the Company's business operations for the foreseeable future. The macroeconomic uncertainties posed by COVID-19 are evolving. Consequently, the Company will continue to evaluate its financial position in light of future developments, particularly those relating to COVID-19, including its variants.
Repurchase Program
In December 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new $50 million share repurchase program effective January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2022, to replace the previous program of the same amount which expired on December 31, 2020. Under the program, the Company repurchased 170,168 shares at a cost of $9.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has a remaining authorization of $40.6 million under the program. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Derivative Instruments
In December 2018, the Company entered into an interest rate swap instrument, effective as of January 2, 2019 and expiring in 2023, to reduce the effect of changes in the variable interest rates associated borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The instrument carried an initial notional amount of $100 million, thereby hedging the first $100 million of borrowings. The instrument effectively fixes the LIBOR component of the borrowings at a monthly rate of 2.71%. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has recorded a liability of $3.9 million for the fair value of the instrument, all of which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. See Note 3 and Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Stock-Based Compensation
We have a stock-based compensation plan for our directors, officers, and employees. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Employee Retirement Plans
In 2021, we sponsored an employee savings plan under the 401(k) plan that covered substantially all employees and included a company matching contribution with the investment of the funds directed by the participants. The Company also contributed to a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan under the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement that covered certain union-represented employees at one of our facilities. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments
As of December 31, 2021, we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments:
See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
MD&A discusses our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies include our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Business Combinations and Allocation of Purchase Price
We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. As of the date that control in the entity is obtained, the purchase price of the transaction is allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The purchase price is determined based on the fair value of consideration transferred to and liabilities assumed from the seller as of the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The determination of the acquisition date fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to future expected cash flows, useful lives, and discount rates.
We commonly use an excess earnings method to value acquired mineral reserves and separately identifiable intangible assets, which may include, but are not limited to, customer relationships, permits, and backlog. Significant assumptions used in the valuation of these types of assets may include projected revenues, production costs, capital requirements, customer attrition rates, and discount rates. Changes in the assumptions used could have a significant impact on the estimated acquisition date fair value of the related asset and any future depreciation, depletion, or amortization expense.
The estimated remaining useful lives of acquired tangible and definite-lived intangible assets are based on the length of time that the assets are expected to provide value to the Company and have a significant impact on current and future period earnings.
Management's estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. We may adjust the amounts recognized in an acquisition during a measurement period after the acquisition date. Any such adjustments are the result of subsequently obtaining additional information that existed at the acquisition date regarding the assets acquired or the liabilities assumed. Measurement period adjustments are generally recorded as increases or decreases to goodwill, if any, recognized in the transaction. The cumulative impact of measurement period adjustments on depreciation, amortization, and other income statement items are recognized in the period the adjustment is determined.
Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. We include results of operations from acquired businesses in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the effective date of the acquisition.
Long-lived Assets
As of December 31, 2021, net property, plant, and equipment and net intangible assets represent 38% and 7% of the Company's total assets, respectively. The methods for recognition of depreciation, depletion, and amortization are based on estimates regarding the expected future economic benefit to the Company and any potential impairment to the value of such assets could be significant. As such, the accounting treatment for these long-lived assets is a critical accounting policy.
Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated or depleted over their estimated useful lives, primarily using the straight-line method. Depletion of mineral reserves is calculated based on estimated proven and probable reserves using the units-of-production method on a quarry-by-quarry basis. Intangible assets, primarily consisting of customer relationships and permits, are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the ranges of estimated useful lives by category of property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets.
We periodically evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used for potential impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used is considered impaired when the carrying value is not recoverable through undiscounted future cash flows and the fair value of the asset or asset group is less than their carrying value. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved or market quotes as available. Significant estimates and judgments that most significantly impact the impairment analysis may include projected revenues, operating profit, and the remaining useful life over which the asset or asset group is expected to generate cash flows.
Impairment losses on long-lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner, except that estimated fair values are reduced by the estimated cost to dispose of the assets.
The Company recorded impairment charges of $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 related to assets that are held for sale. Impairment charges of $7.1 million were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to assets that were disposed of during the year.
Goodwill
Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis whenever events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the goodwill might be impaired. The quantitative goodwill impairment test is assessed at the “reporting unit” level by comparing the reporting unit's estimated fair value with the carrying amount of its net assets. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. The goodwill impairment is measured as the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The estimates and judgments that most significantly affect the fair value calculations are assumptions, consisting of level three inputs, related to revenue and operating profit growth, discount rates, and exit multiples.
As of December 31, 2021, goodwill totaled $934.9 million. Based on the Company's annual goodwill impairment test, performed at the reporting unit level as of December 31, 2021, the Company concluded that no impairment charges were determined to be necessary and that none of the reporting units evaluated were at risk of failing the goodwill impairment test. A reporting unit is considered to be at risk if its estimated fair value does not exceed the carrying value of its net assets by 10% or more. See Note 1 and Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
We believe that the assumptions used in our impairment analysis are reasonable; however, given the uncertainties of the economy and its potential impact on our businesses, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. Additionally, variations in any of these assumptions may result in different calculations in fair value that could result in an impairment charge.
An increase in the discount rate or a reduction in the terminal growth rate of 100 basis points would not have resulted in an impairment of goodwill for any of our reporting units as of December 31, 2021.
Workers' Compensation
We are effectively self-insured for workers’ compensation claims. A third-party administrator processes all such claims. Our liability for workers' compensation claims was $28.9 million and $30.7 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We accrue our workers’ compensation liability based upon independent actuarial studies, which consider loss development factors based on historical claims activity and expected trends. To the extent actuarial assumptions change or claims experience rates differ from historical rates, our liability may change. A 10% change in our workers' compensation liability could impact net income by $2.3 million.
Contingencies and Litigation
The Company is involved in claims and lawsuits and environmental matters incidental to our business. We evaluate our exposure to such claims and suits periodically and establish accruals for these contingencies when probable losses can be reasonably estimated. The range of reasonably possible losses for such matters, taking into consideration our rights in indemnity and recourse to third parties was $9.1 million to $9.5 million as of December 31, 2021 and $0.3 million to $0.4 million as of December 31, 2020.
Based on information currently available with respect to such claims and lawsuits, including information on claims and lawsuits as to which the Company is aware but for which the Company has not been served with legal process, it is management’s opinion that the ultimate outcome of all such claims and litigation, including settlements, in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition for purposes of financial reporting. However, resolution of certain claims or lawsuits by settlement or otherwise, could impact the operating results of the reporting period in which such resolution occurs. For additional information, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Income Taxes
The liability method is used to account for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and other tax attributes using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the provision for income taxes in the period that includes the enactment date. Management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets, and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted law and tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. The Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency, and severity of recent losses; a forecast of future profitability; the duration of statutory carryback and carryforward periods; the Company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused; and tax planning alternatives.
As of December 31, 2021, our adjusted net deferred tax liability was $120.8 million. At December 31, 2021, the Company had $156.7 million federal consolidated net operating loss carryforwards, primarily from businesses acquired, and $6.1 million of tax-effected state loss carryforwards remaining. In addition, the Company had $35.6 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards that will begin to expire in the year 2022. We have established a valuation allowance for state and foreign tax operating losses and credits that we have estimated may not be realizable.
