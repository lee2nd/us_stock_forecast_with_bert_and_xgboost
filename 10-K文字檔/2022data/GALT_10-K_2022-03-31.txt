Results of Operations from the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Research and Development Expense
We generally categorize research and development expenses as either direct external expenses, comprised of amounts paid to third party vendors for services, or all other research and development expenses, comprised of employee payroll and general overhead allocable to research and development. We consider a clinical program to have begun upon acceptance by the FDA, or similar agency outside of the United States, to commence a clinical trial in humans, at which time we begin tracking expenditures by the product candidate. Clinical program expenses comprise payments to vendors related to preparation for, and conduct of, all phases of the clinical trial, including costs for drug manufacture, patient dosing and monitoring, data collection and management, oversight of the trials and reports of results. Pre-clinical expenses comprise all research and development amounts incurred before human trials begin and for additional toxicology studies to support advanced development, including payments to vendors for services related to product experiments and discovery, toxicology, pharmacology, metabolism and efficacy studies, as well as manufacturing process development for a drug candidate. We have two product candidates, belapectin and GM-CT-01; however only belapectin is in active development.
Our research and development expenses were as follows:
Index
Clinical programs expenses increased in the year ended December 31, 2021 over the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to costs related to our the NAVIGATE clinical trial activities and preparations and some preclinical activities incurred in support of the planned clinical program such as development and reproductive toxicity studies, clinical supplies and other supportive activities.
General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries including stock-based compensation, legal and accounting fees, insurance, investor relations, business development and other office related expenses. The primary reasons for the increase for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the same period for 2020, are due to an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation of $373,000 and increase in insurance expense of $395,000.
Other Income and Expense
During the year ended December 31, 2021, other income and expense consisted of $4,000 of interest income offset by amortization of the debt discount associated with warrants issued with a line of credit entered into in December 2017 of $174,000 which is classified as interest expense, and interest expense and amortization of debt discounts on convertible notes payable of $315,000.

We have two product candidates, belapectin and GM-CT-01; however only belapectin is in active development.
Our research and development expenses were as follows:
Index
Clinical programs expenses increased in the year ended December 31, 2020 over the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to costs related to our the NAVIGATE clinical trial activities and preparations and some preclinical activities incurred in support of the planned clinical program such as development and reproductive toxicity studies, clinical supplies and other supportive activities. Other research and development expense increased in the year ended December 31, 2020 over the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to hiring our Chief Medical Officer in March 2020 and an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense.
General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries including stock-based compensation, legal and accounting fees, insurance, investor relations, business development and other office related expenses. The primary reasons for the decrease for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period for 2019, are due to decreases in legal expenses of $339,000, investor relations expenses of $128,000, and non-cash stock-based compensation of $82,000 partially offset by an increase in insurance expenses of $331,000.
Other Income and Expense
During the year ended December 31, 2020, other income and expense consisted of $66,000 of interest income offset by amortization of the debt discount associated with warrants issued with a line of credit entered into in December 2017 of $87,000 which is classified as interest expense.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As described above in the Overview and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are in the development stage and have not generated any revenues to date. Since our inception on July 10, 2000, we have financed our operations from proceeds of public and private offerings of debt and equity. As of December 31, 2021, we raised a net total of $234.5 million from these offerings. At December 31, 2021, the Company had $39.6 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available to fund future operations. The Company believes there is sufficient cash to fund currently planned operations at least through March 31, 2023. We will require more cash to fund our operations after March 31, 2023 and believe we will be able to obtain additional financing. The currently planned operations include costs related to our adaptively designed NAVIGATE Phase 2b/3 clinical trial. Currently, we expect to require an additional approximately $45-$50 million to cover costs of the trial to reach the planned interim analysis estimated to occur in the first quarter of 2024 along with drug manufacturing and other scientific support activities and general and administrative costs and further amounts to complete the Phase 3 portion of the trial. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such new financing or, if available, that such financing will be on terms favorable to us.

Operating leases
Effective December 31, 2018, the Company entered into an amendment to its operating lease for office space in Norcross, GA for a term of thirty-eight months, beginning on January 1, 2019 and ending February 28, 2022 at a rate of approximately $3,800 per month. The amended lease provided for free rent for the first two months of the lease and continues the security deposit of $6,000. In addition to base rental payments included in the contractual obligations table above, the Company is responsible for our pro-rata share of the operating expenses for the building. The Company renewed its existing office space lease effective in February 2022 for 38 months at substantially the same terms.
In October 2012, the Company entered into an operating lease for office and lab space for research and development activities in Natick, MA. The lease is for a period of one year, beginning on October 1, 2012, for a rate of $15,000 for the term, payable in equal monthly increments. This lease was continued on a month-to-month basis from October 1, 2013.
Other. We have engaged outside vendors for certain services associated with our clinical trials. These services are generally available from several providers and, accordingly, our arrangements are typically cancellable on 30 days notice.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not created, and are not a party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements. We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Certain of our accounting policies, however, are critical to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management, which subjects them to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying our accounting policies, our management uses its best judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. Our more significant estimates include stock option valuations and performance vesting features of certain of these instruments, accrued liabilities, deferred income taxes and cash flows. These estimates are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the industry, information available from other outside sources, and on various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. We believe that the critical accounting policies discussed below involve more complex management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods, assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset, liability, revenue and expense amounts.
Accrued Expenses. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued expenses. This process involves identifying services that third parties have performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred on these services as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements. Examples of estimated accrued expenses include professional service fees, such as those arising from the services of attorneys and accountants and accrued payroll expenses. In connection with these service fees, our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual services incurred by the service providers. In the event that we do not identify certain costs that have been incurred or we under- or over-estimate the level of services or costs of such services, our reported expenses for a reporting period could be understated or overstated. The date on which certain services commence, the level of services performed on or before a given date, and the cost of services are often subject to our judgment. We make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses, including personnel costs, allocated facility costs, lab supplies, outside services, contract laboratory costs related to manufacturing drug product, clinical trials and preclinical studies are charged to research and development expense as incurred. The Company accounts for nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities as expense when the service has been performed or when the goods have been received. Our current NAVIGATE clinical trial is being supported by third-party contract research organizations, or CROs, and other vendors. We accrue expenses for clinical trial activities performed by CROs based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each trial. For clinical trial expenses and related expenses associated with the conduct of clinical trials, the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the number of patients enrolled, the number of active clinical sites, and the duration for which the patients have been enrolled in the trial. We monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews, review of contractual terms and correspondence with CROs. We base our estimates on the best information available at the time. We monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through discussions with CRO personnel and based our estimates of clinical trial costs on the best information available at the time. However, additional information may become available to us which will allow us to make a more accurate estimate in future periods. In that event, we may be required to record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual level of activity becomes more certain.
Stock-Based Compensation. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service period, which generally represents the vesting period. For awards that have performance-based vesting conditions the Company recognizes the expense over the estimated period that the awards are expected to be earned. The Company generally uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the grant date fair value of stock options. The expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will be forfeited.
