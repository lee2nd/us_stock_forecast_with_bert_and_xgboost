ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A)
The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the Company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company including the related notes thereto, included elsewhere herein.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021, 2020, AND 2019
2021 SUMMARY OVERVIEW:
On January 25, 2022, AmeriServ Financial, Inc. issued a press release announcing its financial performance for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2021. The results included fourth quarter net income of $1,852,000, or $0.11 per diluted common share. This was an increase of $1,160,000 from the fourth quarter of 2020 when net income totaled $692,000, or $0.04 per diluted share. The full year of 2021 resulted in net income of $7,072,000, or $0.41 per diluted common share. This performance represents a 51.9% increase in earnings per share from the full year of 2020 when net income totaled $4,598,000, or $0.27 per diluted common share.
The continuing struggle of our nation and the world with the global pandemic has brought countless changes to the conduct of the banking business. However, we continue to provide premier banking and wealth management services to our customers in every market we serve. We also believe that we have substantially improved the performance of AmeriServ as a strong regional financial institution. We have zealously guarded our reputation for safety and soundness resulting in our friends and neighbors entrusting us with an additional $85 million of their funds in 2021, adding to the $94 million of absolute deposit growth in 2020. We have done much more than provide safety for these funds. As of December 31, 2021, we have lent 86% of our deposits to small and mid-size regional businesses and consumers. It is our special purpose to be a positive economic contributor to the entire region. As we have learned over the years, our valued borrowers are quality. They are largely responsible for the fact that well over 99% of our loans outstanding are performing exactly as planned. This is a metric we are especially proud to mention.
Our predecessors on the Board of Directors were very wise thirty some years ago to establish a wealth management business within AmeriServ Financial, Inc. Wealth management had a record year in 2021. By pursuing excellent investment strategies, it closed 2021 with $2.7 billion of total assets, an increase of over 9% from just one year ago. This is good news for AmeriServ and for our clients.
It is a fact that both the business of banking and the wealth management activity performed well despite the pandemic. There is a need for flexibility in almost everything we do. We also attended to the well being of this Corporation. Early in 2021, we negotiated the purchase of two branch banks in Somerset County where we already have three successful branches. This brought $42 million of low-cost retail deposit accounts to our balance sheet allowing us to replace more expensive wholesale deposits. Somerset County is in our core market and this branch acquisition was a natural fit. We continue to be on the alert for similar opportunities to strengthen our competitive position at a reasonable purchase price.
As mentioned in previous communications with our shareholders and described in detail within this document, in 2021 we completed the issuance of $27 million of 10-year subordinated debentures. This action reduced the annual cost of capital debt service by a half million dollars annually and allowed us to strengthen our bank’s capital position. Economic conditions were excellent, and the Federal Reserve low interest rate scenario worked to both our short-term and our long-term advantage.
In the midst of this pandemic, we must mention the relationship our staff fostered with our customers and clients. Even when they worked remotely because of local COVID issues, our loans and deposits grew in record levels. However, none of this would be possible without the solid citizens who are our customers and clients. Many of our staff have literally worked personally with small business customers so they could qualify for various government programs. This close communication with our customers will continue long after the pandemic is over.
It is with considerable pride that we can say that our people have confronted the unique challenges of these times. AmeriServ has also satisfied every dollar of required debt service while maintaining its shareholder cash dividend and protecting the livelihood of our 324 staff members. The pandemic may be with us for some time yet, but we pledge the same careful attention to our responsibilities in the days ahead, whatever the challenges may be.
PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW. The following table summarizes some of the Company’s key profitability performance indicators for each of the past three years.
The Company reported net income of  $7,072,000, or $0.41 per diluted common share, in 2021. This represents a 51.9% increase in earnings per share from the full year of 2020 when net income totaled $4,598,000, or $0.27 per diluted common share. The Company’s return on average equity improved to 6.48% for the 2021 year from 4.52% in 2020. Our earnings demonstrated meaningful improvement as we realized the benefit of several important strategic actions that the Company executed during 2021. Overall, the increase in net interest income, a growing level of non-interest income, and a reduced loan loss provision more than offset a higher level of non-interest expense resulting in an improved earnings performance in 2021. In spite of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company continued to generate record levels of both loans and deposits during the year. The good diversification of the Company’s revenue was evident as 31.2% of our total revenue in 2021 came from non-interest income sources which included record contributions from our strong wealth management business. Finally, the Company’s tangible book value(1) per share ended 2021 at $6.02, an increase of 11.1% from 2020. The increase in tangible book value is due to the combination of the Company’s improved earnings performance and effective management of both its investment portfolio and pension obligation. The Company continued to maintain strong capital ratios that exceed the regulatory defined well capitalized status.
The Company reported net income of  $4.6 million, or $0.27 per diluted common share, for 2020. This represented a 22.9% decrease in earnings per share from 2019 when net income totaled $6.0 million, or $0.35 per diluted common share. During 2020, the Company dealt with the many unexpected challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. We continued our conservative risk management posture and prudently built our allowance for loan losses to address increased credit risk in certain sectors of our loan portfolio which was a primary factor causing the decline in earnings between years.
The Company reported net income of  $6.0 million, or $0.35 per diluted common share, for 2019. This represented an 18.6% decrease in earnings per share from 2018 when net income totaled $7.8 million, or $0.43 per diluted common share. The decline in 2019 earnings was caused by an increased loan loss provision primarily related to one large commercial loan and an impairment charge recognized on a Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) related investment.

NET INTEREST INCOME AND MARGIN. The Company’s net interest income represents the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds interest paid on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest income is a primary source of the Company’s earnings; it is affected by interest rate fluctuations as well as changes in the amount and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The following table summarizes the Company’s net interest income performance for each of the past three years:
2021 NET INTEREST PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW. The Company’s net interest income for the full year of 2021 increased by $2.7 million, or 7.5%, when compared to the full year of 2020. The Company’s net interest margin was 3.15% for the full year of 2021 representing a four basis point decline from the full year of 2020. Financial results
when comparing 2021 to 2020 are indicative of an improving economic environment as well as the Company’s execution of strategies to effectively meet the challenge presented by the low interest rate environment. This included the execution of several strategies to reduce our cost of funds. However, the emergence of the omicron variant, high inflation and supply chain issues remind us that many risks remain. AmeriServ has proven to be resilient given the complex challenges we have confronted. The Company will continue to adapt in this fluid environment and prioritize the well-being of our employees and the communities we serve.
The Company demonstrated significantly higher than historical levels of both total average loans and total average deposits during 2021. This growth is due to successful business development efforts, the impact from the government stimulus programs and the 2021 Somerset County branch acquisition. Net interest income improved due to (i) the positive impact of commercial real estate and residential mortgage loan growth, (ii) significant interest expense savings from the issuance of the subordinated debt during the third quarter of 2021, which was used to retire higher cost existing subordinated debt and trust preferred securities, and (iii) the utilization of acquired low-cost core deposits to replace higher cost institutional deposits that were on our balance sheet. The combination of these three factors more than offset the unfavorable impact of net interest margin pressure from lower earning asset yields. The significant decrease to total interest expense in 2021 was the primary driver for net interest income increasing compared to last year.
Total average earning assets increased by $102.9 million, or 9.0%, in 2021. Specifically, total loans averaged $989 million in 2021 which is $65.5 million, or 7.1%, higher than the 2020 full year average. Short-term investments and commercial paper averaged $47 million in 2021 which is $15.3 million, or 48.0%, higher than the 2020 full year average. Total investment securities averaged $210 million in 2021 which is $22.1 million, or 11.8%, higher than the 2020 full year average. These increases were largely offset by decreases in the yield on earning assets, which decreased from 4.11% to 3.76%.
Total deposits, including non-interest bearing demand deposits, averaged $1.154 billion for the full year of 2021, which was $119.6 million, or 11.6%, higher than the $1.035 billion average for the full year of 2020. The 2021 full year average of short-term and FHLB borrowed funds was $50 million, which represented a decrease of  $19.3 million, or 27.9%. Overall, the Company’s loan to deposit ratio averaged 85.5% in the fourth quarter of 2021, which we believe indicates that the Company has ample capacity to continue to grow its loan portfolio through effective business development efforts and is also strongly positioned to provide the necessary assistance to our customers and our community as they recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and respond to an improving economy. Overall, the cost of total interest bearing liabilities decreased from 1.10% to 0.75%.
COMPONENT CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME: 2021 VERSUS 2020. Regarding the separate components of net interest income, the Company’s total interest income in 2021 decreased by $213,000, or 0.5%, when compared to 2020. Total average earning assets increased by $102.9 million, or 9.0%, in 2021 as there was an increased level of average total loans, short-term investments, and total investment securities. Despite the growth in average earning assets, interest income was unfavorably impacted by a decrease in the earning asset yield which declined by 35 basis points from 4.11% to 3.76%. All categories within the earning asset base demonstrated an interest income decrease between years. The average total loan portfolio yield decreased by 29 basis points from 4.40% to 4.11% in 2021 while the average yield on total investment securities decreased by 33 basis points from 3.20% to 2.87%.
Total investment securities averaged $210 million for the full year of 2021, which is $22.1 million, or 11.8%, higher than the $188 million average in 2020. The Company continued to be selective in 2021 when purchasing securities due to the low interest rate environment. Specifically, a steeper U.S. Treasury yield curve generally results in improved yields for federal agency mortgage-backed securities and federal agency bonds. Once this occurs, management purchases more of these investments for our portfolio. This provides us with the opportunity to more profitably deploy a portion of the increased liquidity on our balance sheet into the securities portfolio as opposed to leaving these funds in low yielding federal funds sold. This redeployment of funds contributed to total securities growing between years. Management also continued to purchase taxable municipal and corporate securities to maintain a well-diversified portfolio.
The economic recovery has been evident in our lending activity as we continued to experience good loan production throughout 2021. Commercial loan pipelines returned to pre-COVID levels early this year. The overall total loan portfolio volume stabilized during the second half of the year as additional loan growth was offset by a high level of early payoff activity, particularly during the fourth quarter. Also, PPP loans continue to decline as they complete the forgiveness process. Overall, when compared to the most recently completed pre-pandemic year of 2019, total loan production was over $79 million, or 31.2%, higher in 2021. Although reduced from its peak in 2020, strong residential
mortgage loan production continued throughout 2021. Residential mortgage loan production totaled $90.5 million in 2021 which declined by 36.5% from the production level of $142.5 million achieved in 2020. Despite the decline between years, this is the second highest level of residential mortgage loan production during the most recently completed eight-year period. The Company revised strategy in 2021 and retained a higher percentage of our residential mortgage loan production in the loan portfolio as opposed to selling into the secondary market. This strategic change allowed us to more profitably deploy a portion of the increased liquidity that we have on our balance sheet.
As stated previously, total loans continue to be significantly higher than historical levels and averaged $989 million for the full year of 2021, which is $65.5 million, or 7.1%, higher than the 2020 full year average. The growth experienced in our commercial real estate portfolio resulted in traditional loan fee income increasing by $465,000, or 41.9%, for the full year of 2021 when compared to last year. Total PPP loans averaged $23.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, decreasing by $41.4 million, or 63.9%, from last year’s fourth quarter average as we continue to work with our customers through the forgiveness process. The Company recorded a total of $2.3 million of processing fee income and interest income from PPP lending activity in 2021, which is $398,000, or 21.2%, higher than the 2020 level. Finally, on an end of period basis, excluding total PPP loans, the total loan portfolio grew by approximately $48.7 million, or 5.3%, since the end of the fourth quarter of 2020.
Similar to what is occurring across the banking industry, our liquidity position continues to be strong due to the significant influx of deposits. During the first quarter of 2021, the President signed into law another round of economic stimulus as part of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The stimulus checks delivered to most Americans and the financial assistance provided to municipalities and school districts as part of this program contributed to total deposits increasing significantly. Our deposit balances were also positively impacted in the second quarter of 2021 by the Somerset County branch acquisition, which provided approximately $42 million of additional deposits. The challenges this increased liquidity presents are twofold. First, there is the uncertainty regarding the duration that these increased funds will remain on the balance sheet which will be determined by customer behavior as economic conditions change. The second challenge is to profitably deploy this increased liquidity given the current low yields on short-term investment products. As a result, short-term investment and commercial paper balances averaged $47.3 million for the full year of 2021, which remains high by historical standards. Late in the third quarter of 2021, the Company benefitted from utilizing a significant portion of our increased liquidity to allow a $33 million, high cost, institutional deposit to mature. This resulted in total short-term investments declining to a more manageable level. However, diligent monitoring and management of our short-term investment position remains a priority. Continued loan growth and prudent investment in securities are critical to achieve the best return on the remaining increased funds.
Total interest expense for the twelve months of 2021 decreased by $2.9 million, or 27.9%, when compared to 2020, due to lower levels of both deposit and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings interest expense. Specifically, deposit interest expense in 2021 was lower by $2.8 million, or 37.0%, despite the previously mentioned increase in deposits that occurred between years. The deposit growth reflects new deposit inflows as well as the loyalty of the bank’s core deposit base. The previously mentioned late third quarter 2021 maturity of a $33 million institutional deposit that had an annual cost of 2.95% resulted in approximately $240,000 of interest expense savings during the fourth quarter. Additionally, management continues to effectively execute several deposit product pricing reductions to address the net interest margin challenges presented by the low interest rate environment. As a result, the Company experienced deposit cost relief. Specifically, our total deposit cost averaged 0.42% for the full year of 2021 compared to 0.74% in 2020, representing a meaningful decrease of 32 basis points. Note that total deposit cost in the fourth quarter of 2021 averaged 0.31%. Total FHLB borrowings interest expense for the full year of 2021 was lower by $252,000, or 22.3%, compared to 2020. The current strong liquidity position has allowed the Company to paydown short-term and FHLB advances, which typically cost more than similar term deposit products. At December 31, 2021, total short-term and FHLB advances were $42.7 million, which is $47 million, or 52.4%, lower than the December 31, 2020 level.
The Company completed a private placement of $27 million in fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes on August 26, 2021. The notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 3.75%, payable until September 1, 2026. From and including September 1, 2026, the interest rate will reset quarterly to the then-current three-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 3.11%. The Company used approximately $20 million of the net proceeds to retire its existing subordinated debt and trust preferred securities that had a weighted average cost of 7.73%. This strategy favorably reduced fourth quarter 2021 interest expense by $147,000 and it is expected that annual interest expense on long-term debt will decline by $588,000. This savings is being recognized even though the size of the new subordinated debt is $7 million higher than the debt instruments it replaced. The remainder of the proceeds are being utilized for general corporate purposes, including the downstream of $3.5 million of capital to the bank which will support additional loan growth. Long-term debt interest expense is higher for the full year of 2021 when compared to 2020 because the
Company was required to immediately write off the remaining portion of the unamortized issuance costs from both original debt instruments which generated $202,000 of additional borrowings interest expense in the third quarter of 2021. Therefore, in aggregate, when considering the reduced short-term and FHLB borrowings interest cost, total borrowings interest expense decreased by $101,000, or 3.5%, for the full year.
2020 NET INTEREST PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW. The Company’s net interest income for the full year of 2020 increased by $925,000, or 2.6%, when compared to the full year of 2019. The Company’s net interest margin was 3.19% for the full year of 2020 which represented a ten basis point decline from the full year of 2019. Our net interest margin performance was challenged throughout 2020 as a result of the low interest rate environment and the economic uncertainty and volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As COVID-19 cases surged, government officials recommended the implementation of certain safety measures and restrictions on businesses and individuals. As a result, AmeriServ had to close its lobbies to customer traffic two separate times during the year for an extended period of time, but continued to service customers through drive up access. In spite of these pandemic related challenges, our balance sheet experienced robust growth in 2020 which caused the increase in net interest income despite the decline in the net interest margin due to pressures from the low interest rate environment. Total average earning assets increased by $62.2 million, or 5.8%, in 2020. Specifically, total loans averaged $923 million in 2020 which was $48.1 million, or 5.5%, higher than the 2019 full year average. Short-term investments and commercial paper averaged $32 million in 2020 which was $20.4 million, or 176.3%, higher than the 2019 full year average. Slightly offsetting the higher level of average loans and short-term investments was a decrease in average investment securities. Total investment securities averaged $188 million in 2020 which was $6.2 million, or 3.2%, lower than the 2019 full year average.
Total deposits, including non-interest bearing demand deposits, averaged $1.035 billion for the full year of 2020, which was $55.2 million, or 5.6%, higher than the $980 million average for the full year of 2019. The 2020 full year average of short-term and FHLB borrowed funds was $69 million, which represented an increase of  $5.6 million, or 8.8%. Overall, the Company’s loan to deposit ratio averaged 90.9% in the fourth quarter of 2020 which we believe indicated that the Company had ample capacity to continue to grow its loan portfolio and was well positioned to continue assisting our customers and the community given the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic was having on the economy.
COMPONENT CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME: 2020 VERSUS 2019. Regarding the separate components of net interest income, the Company’s total interest income in 2020 decreased by $2.9 million, or 5.8%, when compared to 2019. Total average earning assets increased by $62.2 million, or 5.8%, in 2020 as the increased level of average total loans and short term investments more than offset the lower level of average total investment securities. Despite the growth in average earning assets, interest income was unfavorably impacted by a decrease in the earning asset yield which declined by 50 basis points from 4.61% to 4.11%. All categories within the earning asset base demonstrated an interest income decrease between years. The average total loan portfolio yield decreased by 51 basis points from 4.91% to 4.40% in 2020 while the average yield on total investment securities decreased by 16 basis points from 3.36% to 3.20%.
Total investment securities averaged $188 million for the full year of 2020 which was $6.2 million, or 3.2%, lower than the $194 million average in 2019. The Company was selective in 2020 when purchasing the more typical types of securities that had been purchased historically as the market was less favorable for purchases, offering a lower return given the differences in the position and shape of the U.S. Treasury yield curve from 2019. To somewhat offset the unfavorable market for the more traditional types of purchases, the Company had been active since March of 2020 purchasing corporate securities, particularly subordinated debt issued by other financial institutions along with taxable municipal securities. Subordinated debt offers higher yields than the typical types of securities in which we invest and was particularly attractive given the current low interest rate environment and modestly positive slope of the yield curve. Management believed it to be acceptable to increase our investments in bank subordinated debt in a gradual and diversified manner, given the heavily regulated nature of the industry combined with our intensive due diligence process and adherence to our internal guidelines for these types of investments.
Total loans reached record levels and averaged $923 million for the full year of 2020 which was $48.1 million, or 5.5%, higher than the 2019 full year average. The growth between years was primarily related to AmeriServ’s participation in the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) 100% guraranteed Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) which remained on the balance sheet from the time of their inception through year end. During 2020, the Company processed 477 PPP loans totaling $68.7 million to assist small businesses and our community in the difficult economy. Also, the Company recorded a total of $1.9 million of processing fee income and interest income from PPP lending activity. The remaining portion of PPP processing fees totaled approximately $755,000 and was amortized into income
over the time period that the loans remained on our balance sheet or until the PPP loan was forgiven at which time the remaining fee was recognized immediately as income. Note that the level of PPP loans decreased by approximately $10 million during the fourth quarter of 2020 as we worked through the forgiveness process with our customers. In late December 2020, the Federal Government passed a new $900 billion pandemic relief bill which included $284.5 billion for the re-opening of the SBA Paycheck Protection Program. The Company participated in the 2021 program and continued to provide assistance to our business customers. Normal commercial lending production improved during the final four months of the year and commercial loan pipelines also improved to pre-COVID levels. Overall, on an end of period basis and excluding total PPP loans, the total loan portfolio grew by approximately $39.1 million since September 30, 2020. Residential mortgage loan production continued to be exceptionally strong throughout the year and reached a record level given the lower interest rate environment. For the full year of 2020, residential mortgage loan production totaled $142 million and was 139% higher than the production level of $60 million achieved for the full year of 2019. Even though total average loans increased compared to 2019 and loan interest income was enhanced by the PPP revenue, loan interest and fee income declined by $2.3 million, or 5.4%, for the full year. The lower loan interest income reflected the challenges that the record low interest rate environment had created. New loans were being originated at lower yields and certain loans tied to LIBOR or the prime rate repriced downward as both of these indices had moved down with the Federal Reserve’s decision to decrease the target federal funds interest rate by a total of 225 basis points since June of 2019.
Our liquidity position continued to be strong due to the significant influx of deposits that resulted from the government stimulus programs and as customers continued to be cautious and were demonstrating reduced spending activity due to the economic uncertainty. As a result, short-term investments and commercial paper averaged $32 million for the full year of 2020 which was $20.4 million, or 176.3%, higher than the 2019 full year average. The challenge of profitably deploying this excess liquidity resulted in management initially investing in high quality commercial paper given their short maturities and higher rates of return. However, as 2020 progressed, the yields on commercial paper experienced a steady decline, once again creating pressure to find a suitable return for our excess liquidity. This pressure was eased during the fourth quarter given the loan growth that occurred which resulted in short-term investment balances returning to a more normal level.
Total interest expense for the twelve months of 2020 decreased by $3.8 million, or 26.6%, when compared to 2019, due to lower levels of both deposit and borrowing interest expense. Deposit interest expense in the full year of 2020 was lower by $3.6 million, or 31.8%. Total average deposits reached a record level, averaging $1.035 billion for the year, which was $55.2 million, or 5.6%, higher than the 2019 full year average and reflected the benefit of government stimulus programs and reduced consumer spending in 2020. In addition, the Company’s loyal core deposit base continued to be a source of strength for the Company during periods of market volatility. Management continued to effectively execute several deposit product pricing decreases given the low interest rate environment and the downward pressure that the low interest rates were having on the net interest margin. As a result, the Company experienced deposit cost relief. Overall, total deposit cost, including demand deposits, averaged 0.74% in 2020 compared to 1.14% in 2019, or a meaningful decrease of 40 basis points.
The Company experienced a $255,000, or 8.1%, decrease in the interest cost of borrowings in the full year of 2020 when compared to the full year of 2019. The decline was a result of the Federal Reserve’s actions to decrease interest rates and the impact that these rate decreases had on the cost of overnight borrowed funds and the replacement of matured FHLB term advances. The total 2020 full year average term advance borrowings balance increased by approximately $11.7 million, or 22.4%, when compared to the full year of 2019 as the Company took advantage of the lower yield curve to prudently extend borrowings. The rate on certain FHLB term advances was lower than the rate on overnight borrowings. As a result, the combined growth of average FHLB term advances and total average deposits resulted in less reliance on overnight borrowed funds, which decreased between years by $6.1 million. Overall, the 2020 full year average of total short-term and FHLB borrowed funds was $69.0 million, which represented an increase of $5.6 million, or 8.8%, from 2019.
The table that follows provides an analysis of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis (non-GAAP) setting forth (i) average assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity, (ii) interest income earned on interest earning assets and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities, (iii) average yields earned on interest earning assets and average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities, (iv) interest rate spread (the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities), and (v) net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average total interest earning assets). For purposes of this table, loan balances include non-accrual loans, and interest income on loans includes loan fees or amortization of such fees which have been deferred, as well as interest recorded on certain non-accrual loans as cash is received. Regulatory stock is included within available for sale
investment securities for this analysis. Additionally, a tax rate of 21% was used to compute tax-equivalent interest income and yields (non-GAAP). The tax equivalent adjustments to interest income on loans and municipal securities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was 18,000, 24,000, and 24,000, respectively, which is reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure at the bottom of the table. Differences between the net interest spread and margin from a GAAP basis to a tax-equivalent basis were not material.
Net interest income may also be analyzed by segregating the volume and rate components of interest income and interest expense. The table below sets forth an analysis of volume and rate changes in net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis. For purposes of this table, changes in interest income and interest expense are allocated to volume and rate categories based upon the respective percentage changes in average balances and average rates. Changes in net
interest income that could not be specifically identified as either a rate or volume change were allocated proportionately to changes in volume and changes in rate.
LOAN QUALITY. The Company’s written lending policies require underwriting, loan documentation, and credit analysis standards to be met prior to funding any loan. After the loan has been approved and funded, continued periodic credit review is required. The Company’s policy is to individually review, as circumstances warrant, each of its commercial and commercial mortgage loans to determine if a loan is impaired. At a minimum, credit reviews are mandatory for all commercial and commercial mortgage loan relationships with aggregate balances in excess of  $1,000,000 within a 12-month period. The Company has also identified three pools of small dollar value homogeneous loans which are evaluated collectively for impairment. These separate pools are for small business relationships with aggregate balances of  $250,000 or less, residential mortgage loans and consumer loans. Individual loans within these pools are reviewed and removed from the pool if factors such as significant delinquency in payments of 90 days or more, bankruptcy, or other negative economic concerns indicate impairment.
Overall, the Company continues to maintain good asset quality. The continued successful ongoing problem credit resolution efforts of the Company is demonstrated in the table above as levels of non-accrual loans, non-performing assets, and loan delinquency are well below 1% of total loans. Overall, we believe that non-performing assets remain well controlled, and such assets have remained stable since the prior year totaling $3.3 million, or 0.34% of total loans, on December 31, 2021. The increase in accruing loan delinquency is the result of several residential mortgage loan borrowers demonstrating delinquency during the fourth quarter of 2021. Slightly offsetting this increase in residential mortgage loan delinquency during the fourth quarter was a decrease in commercial loan delinquency. In addition, the Company experienced an increase in non-accrual loans as a result of three commercial loan relationships, two of which were previously designated as a trouble debt restructure (TDR), being transferred into non-accrual status during the first half of 2021, which was partially offset by a decrease in non-accrual residential mortgage loans. Total classified loans increased $5.2 million since the prior year-end and now total $17.0 million. The increase in classified loans is the result of the risk rating downgrade of several commercial real estate loan relationships during 2021 in the hospitality and personal care industries.
The Company remains committed to prudently working with our borrowers that have been hardest hit by the pandemic by granting them loan payment modifications. Borrower requested modifications primarily consist of the deferral of principal and/or interest payments. On December 31, 2021, loans totaling approximately $7.7 million, or 0.8% of total loans, were on a payment modification plan. These loans include five commercial borrowers primarily in the hospitality and personal care industries. This current level of borrowers requesting payment deferrals is down sharply from its peak level of approximately $200 million as of June 30, 2020. Management continues to carefully monitor asset quality with a particular focus on these customers that have requested payment deferrals. Deferral extension requests are considered based upon the customer’s needs and their impacted industry as well as borrower and guarantor capacity to service debt and issued regulatory guidance. See the disclosures regarding COVID-19 related modifications within the Non-Performing Assets Including Troubled Debt Restructurings footnote.
We also continue to closely monitor the loan portfolio given the number of relatively large-sized commercial and commercial real estate loans within the portfolio. As of December 31, 2021, the 25 largest credits represented 22.3% of total loans outstanding, which represents a slight decrease from December 31, 2020 when it was 22.6%.
ALLOWANCE AND PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES. As described in more detail in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of this MD&A, the Company uses a comprehensive methodology and procedural discipline to maintain an ALL to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio. The Company believes this is a critical accounting policy since it involves significant estimates and judgments. The following table sets forth changes in the ALL and certain ratios for the periods ended.
For 2021, the Company recorded a $1.1 million provision expense for loan losses compared to a $2.4 million provision expense in 2020. The lower 2021 provision reflects an improved credit quality outlook for the overall portfolio due to several loan upgrades as well as reduced criticized asset levels and delinquent loan balances demonstrating improvement this year. This reflects the Company’s loan officers working effectively with our customers as the economy improves and as businesses return to normal operations with limited restrictions. As demonstrated historically, the Company continues its strategic conviction that a strong allowance for loan losses is needed, which has proven to be essential as we support certain borrowers as they fully recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company continued
to grow the allowance for loan losses given the portfolio growth achieved during the year, specifically in the non-owner occupied commercial real estate and residential mortgage portfolios, which was dampened by a decline in the commercial portfolio. The need to fund the allowance for portfolio growth was somewhat eased by numerous upgrades, which occurred during 2021.
The Company experienced low net loan charge-offs of $47,000, which equates to 0.00% of total loans, in 2021 and compares favorably to net loan charge-offs of  $309,000, or 0.03% of total loans, in 2020. Since the end of the fourth quarter of 2020, the balance of the allowance for loan losses increased by $1.1 million, or 9.3%, to $12.4 million at December 31, 2021. Non-performing assets totaled $3.3 million, or 0.34% of total loans, at December 31, 2021. Management continues to carefully monitor asset quality with a particular focus on loan customers that have requested an additional payment deferral. The Asset Quality Task Force is meeting at least monthly to review these particular relationships, receiving input from the business lenders regarding their ongoing discussions with the borrowers. In summary, the allowance for loan losses provided 373% coverage of non-performing assets, and 1.26% of total loans, at December 31, 2021, compared to 341% coverage of non-performing assets, and 1.16% of total loans, at December 31, 2020. Note that the reserve coverage to total loans, excluding PPP loans (non-GAAP), was 1.28% and 1.23% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Small Business Administration guarantees 100% of the PPP loans made to eligible borrowers which minimizes the level of credit risk associated with these loans. As a result, such loans are assigned a 0% risk weight for purposes of calculating the Bank’s risk-based capital ratios. Therefore, it was deemed appropriate to not allocate any portion of the loan loss reserve for the PPP loans.
Management believes that this non-GAAP measure provides a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhances comparability of results of operations with prior periods. The Company believes that investors may use this non-GAAP measure to analyze the Company’s financial condition without the impact of unusual items or events that may obscure trends in the Company’s underlying financial condition. This non-GAAP data should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and is not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Limitations associated with non-GAAP financial measures include the risks that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items included in these measures and that different companies might calculate these measures differently. The following table sets forth the calculation of the Company’s allowance for loan loss reserve coverage to total loans (GAAP) and the reserve coverage to total loans, excluding PPP loans (non-GAAP), at December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands, except percentages).
For 2020, the Company recorded a $2,375,000 provision expense for loan losses compared to an $800,000 provision expense in 2019 which resulted in a net unfavorable shift of $1.6 million between years. The Company continued to build the allowance for loan losses given the overall economic climate and the uncertainty that existed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 provision reflected management’s strengthening of certain qualitative factors within the allowance for loan losses calculation and downgrades of loan relationships that were reflective of the industries that were especially negatively impacted by the pandemic, primarily the hospitality industry, and were demonstrating a slow pace of recovery. Early in 2020, several loans within the hospitality industry were downgraded. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2020, the downgrade of a hospitality related credit and a large transportation related credit, as well as the loan growth experienced resulted in the provision increasing. Specifically, the effect of these downgrades was an increase in the allowance for the commercial loans secured by non-owner occupied real estate portfolio. The decrease in the allowance balance for the commercial loan portfolio was the result of two substantial commercial loans which were previously classified as substandard being upgraded. In addition, the growth in the allowance balance for residential mortgage loans was the result of the increased origination activity experienced within the portfolio during 2020 given the lower interest rate environment. The Company experienced net loan charge-offs of $309,000, or 0.03% of total loans, in 2020 compared to net loan charge-offs of  $192,000, or 0.02% of total loans, in 2019. Overall, non-performing assets
totaled $3.3 million, or 0.34% of total loans, at December 31, 2020. In summary, the allowance for loan losses provided 341% coverage of non-performing assets, and 1.16% of total loans, at December 31, 2020, compared to 397% coverage of non-performing assets, and 1.05% of total loans, at December 31, 2019.
The following schedule sets forth the allocation of the ALL among various loan categories. This allocation is determined by using the consistent quarterly procedural discipline that was previously discussed. The entire ALL is available to absorb future loan losses in any loan category.
Even though residential real estate mortgage loans comprise 29.2% of the Company’s total loan portfolio, only $1.6 million, or 12.8%, of the total ALL is allocated against this loan category. The residential real estate mortgage loan allocation is based upon the Company’s three-year historical average of actual loan charge-offs experienced in that category and other qualitative factors. The disproportionately higher allocations for commercial loans and commercial loans secured by non-owner occupied real estate reflect the increased credit risk associated with those types of lending, the Company’s historical loss experience in these categories, and other qualitative factors.
Based on the Company’s current ALL methodology and the related assessment of the inherent risk factors contained within the Company’s loan portfolio, we believe that the ALL is adequate at December 31, 2021 to cover losses within the Company’s loan portfolio.
NON-INTEREST INCOME. Non-interest income for 2021 totaled $17.8 million, an increase of $1.5 million, or 9.1%, from 2020. Factors contributing to this higher level of non-interest income in 2021 included:
● a $1.8 million, or 17.4%, increase in wealth management fees as the entire wealth management group has performed exceptionally well through the pandemic, actively working for clients to increase the value of their holdings in the financial markets and adding new business. The fair market value of wealth management assets totaled $2.7 billion and increased from the early pandemic fair market value low point on March 31, 2020 by $728.7 million, or 36.7%;
● an $859,000, or 56.4%, decrease in net gains on loans held for sale due a lower level of mortgage loan refinance activity in 2021 and the Company’s revised strategy to retain a higher percentage of our residential mortgage loan production in the portfolio as opposed to selling into the secondary market. The Company has retained 79% of all residential mortgage loan originations into the loan portfolio in 2021 compared to 40% in 2020;
● a $335,000, or 42.8%, increase in revenue from bank owned life insurance due to the receipt of $310,000 in death claims as well as 2021 income being positively impacted by a financial floor taking hold which caused increased earnings and a higher rate of return on certain policies;
● a $291,000, or 12.7%, increase in other income primarily due to higher interchange fee income that resulted from increased usage of debit cards as the pandemic caused consumers to increase online purchases and many businesses to implement contactless services by not accepting cash due to health safety concerns. Also, service charges on deposit accounts increased by $62,000, or 6.9%, in 2021 as consumers are becoming more active and increasing their spending habits;
● a $201,000, or 36.0%, decrease in mortgage related fees due to a lower level of residential mortgage loan production; and
● the Company recognized an $84,000 gain on investment security sales in 2021 as compared to last year when no securities were sold.
Non-interest income for 2020 totaled $16.3 million, an increase of $1.5 million, or 10.2%, from 2019. Factors contributing to this higher level of non-interest income in 2020 included:
● a $658,000, or 76.1%, increase in income from residential mortgage loan sales into the secondary market due to the strong level of residential mortgage loan production. The higher level of residential mortgage loan production also resulted in mortgage related fees increasing by $257,000, or 85.1%;
● the Company recognized a $500,000 impairment charge on a Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) related investment in 2019 and there was no charge in 2020 since the full investment was written off in the prior year;
● a $482,000, or 5.0%, increase in wealth management fees. In addition to an improved level of fee income from the financial services business unit, the entire wealth management division had been resilient and performed well in spite of the major market value decline that occurred in late March 2020. The market value of wealth management assets recovered and improved from the pre-pandemic valuation, exceeding the March 31, 2020 market value by 25% and also exceeding the market value as of December 31, 2019 by 11%;
● a $368,000, or 29.0%, decrease in service charges on deposit accounts as consumer spending activity-based fees such as deposit service charges, which include overdraft fees, decreased significantly with the shutdown of the economy and had been slow to improve given the pace of the economic recovery;
● a $261,000, or 50.1%, increase in revenue from bank owned life insurance due to the receipt of a $91,000 death claim and a financial floor taking hold which caused increased earnings and a higher rate of return on certain policies; and
● no investment security sale activity occurred in 2020 after the Company recognized a $118,000 net realized gain on investment securities in 2019.
NON-INTEREST EXPENSE. Non-interest expense for 2021 totaled $47.0 million, which represents a $2.5 million, or 5.7%, increase from 2020. Factors contributing to the higher non-interest expense in 2021 included:
● a $1.1 million, or 19.8%, increase in other expense primarily due to the recognition of a $1.7 million settlement charge in connection with the Company’s defined benefit pension plan, which is described in Note 17, Employee Benefit Plans. Also contributing to the higher level of other expense was the Company recognizing $117,000 of expense associated with the unfunded commitment reserve in 2021 which represents a $271,000 unfavorable shift from 2020;
● a $457,000, or 1.7%, increase in salaries and employee benefits expense. Factors causing the increase included greater incentive compensation primarily due to commissions earned as a result of strong performance in the wealth management businesses and continued good residential mortgage and commercial loan production. Also contributing to the higher salaries and employee benefits expense was increased health care costs which were partially offset by the Company’s basic salary expense declining due to fewer employees;
● the Company recognized costs for the branch acquisition totaling $389,000 for 2021;
● a $237,000, or 4.5%, increase in professional fees due to an increased level of outsourced professional services related costs and increased fees due to the PPP lending activity. Also, other professional fees at the Trust Company increased year over year due to additional support services;
● a $174,000, or 36.2%, increase in FDIC deposit insurance expense due to an increase in the asset assessment base and the benefit of the Small Bank Assessment Credit being fully utilized in the first quarter of 2020;
● a $110,000, or 4.4%, increase in net occupancy expense primarily due to the additional costs related to the branch acquisition; and
● a $46,000, or 6.4%, decrease in supplies, postage and freight expense as the majority of the personal protective equipment to protect our employees and customers during the pandemic was purchased last year.
Non-interest expense for 2020 totaled $44.5 million, which represented a $2.6 million, or 6.3%, increase from 2019. Factors contributing to the higher non-interest expense in 2020 included:
● a $2.0 million, or 7.7%, increase in salaries and employee benefits expense was due to increased incentive compensation, total salaries, pension expense, and health care costs. A $645,000, or 57.9%, increase in incentive compensation was primarily due to commissions earned as a result of increased residential mortgage loan production. Total salaries were higher by $625,000, 3.5%, for 2020 primarily due to separation costs related to the elimination of a management position and annual merit increases. Pension expense increased by $506,000, or 30.4%, as a result of the unfavorable impact that the lower interest rate environment had on the discount rates that are used to revalue the defined benefit pension obligation each year. In addition, there was a $424,000, or 13.9%, increase in health care costs;
● FDIC deposit insurance expense increased by $381,000 and returned to a more normal level after the benefit from the application of the Small Bank Assessment Credit regulation expired early in 2020;
● a $334,000, or 6.8%, increase in professional fees resulted from higher appraisal fees due to the significantly higher level of residential mortgage loan production, higher legal fees related to PPP loan processing, personnel related matters and an increased level of outside professional services related costs; and
● a $215,000, or 3.8%, decrease in other expense due to reduced outside processing fees and telephone costs as well as a lower level of meals and travel costs that related to travel restrictions from the pandemic. In addition, the favorable comparison for other expense also resulted from a reduction recognized for the unfunded commitment reserve.
INCOME TAX EXPENSE. The Company recorded an income tax expense of  $1.7 million, or an effective tax rate of 19.4%, in 2021, compared to income tax expense of  $1.2 million, or a 20.9% effective tax rate, in 2020, and compared to income tax expense of  $1.6 million, or a 20.7% effective tax rate, in 2019. The increased income tax expense for the full year of 2021 is a result of the Company’s improved profitability this year. The higher effective tax rate in 2020 resulted from the write-off of a deferred tax asset related to the dissolution of the Company’s former small life insurance subsidiary. The Company’s deferred tax liability was $934,000 at December 31, 2021 compared to a deferred tax asset of $1.6 million at December 31, 2020, resulting primarily from change in the pension liability.
SEGMENT RESULTS. The community banking segment reported a net income contribution of $12.1 million in 2021 which improved from the $10.1 million contribution in 2020 and also increased from the $10.9 million contribution in 2019. The improvement between years is due to a higher level of total revenue and a reduced loan loss provision which more than offset an increased level of non-interest expense. Net interest income improved between years as a significant reduction to total interest expense more than offset a much lower reduction to total interest income. This segment is being favorably impacted by commercial real estate loan growth which correspondingly resulted in loan charge income increasing. Also, loan growth was positively impacted by the Company retaining more residential mortgage loans in the portfolio as opposed to selling in the secondary market. This growth more than offset payoff activity and maturities in the commercial & industrial loan portfolio. Additionally, PPP processing fee income increased between years by $398,000. Overall, total loan interest income decreased modestly by $49,000 in 2021. Favorably impacting net interest income was this segment experiencing deposit cost relief as total deposit interest expense decreased between years due to management’s action to lower pricing of several deposit products, given the low interest rate environment. The decrease to total deposit interest expense occurred even though total deposits increased significantly between years which is described previously in the MD&A. This segment was also favorably impacted by management’s strategic decision during the fourth quarter of 2021 to not replace a maturing high cost, large institutional deposit which resulted in approximately $240,000 of interest expense savings during the fourth quarter. The Company recorded a $1,100,000 provision expense for loan losses in 2021 compared to a $2,375,000 provision in 2020. This was discussed previously in the Allowance and Provision for Loan Losses section within this document. Non-interest income was favorably impacted by increased levels of interchange income, checking service charges and revenue from bank owned life insurance (BOLI). Note that the Company electing to retain the majority of residential mortgage loans
production in the loan portfolio resulted in a decrease to loan sale gains. Non-interest expense compares unfavorably in 2021 due to the Company recognizing a settlement charge on its defined benefit pension plan, which was previously discussed in the MD&A. Other significant increases to non-interest expense between years were higher incentive compensation and health care costs and additional expense recognized for the Somerset County branch acquisition. Finally, non-interest expense was unfavorably impacted by higher professional fees, FDIC insurance expense and occupancy costs.
The wealth management segment’s net income contribution was $2.9 million in 2021 compared to $2.0 million in 2020 and $1.9 million in 2019. The increase is due to wealth management fees increasing as the entire wealth management group has performed exceptionally well through the pandemic, actively working with clients to increase the value of their holdings in the financial markets and adding new business. Slightly offsetting this favorable performance were higher levels of professional fees and total employee costs. Overall, the fair market value of trust assets under administration totaled $2.7 billion at December 31, 2021, an improvement from the early pandemic fair market value low point at March 31, 2020, exceeding by $728.7 million, or 36.7%.
The investment/parent segment reported a net loss of  $7.8 million in 2021, which was greater than the net loss of  $7.5 million in 2020 and $6.8 million in 2019. The increased loss in 2021 was due to the Company having to write off the remaining portion of unamortized issuance costs from existing subordinated debt and trust preferred securities that were replaced by the private placement of $27 million in subordinated notes on August 26, 2021, This write-off caused $202,000 of additional borrowings interest expense during the third quarter of 2021. Also, the original debt instruments did not leave the balance sheet until September 30, 2021 as per terms required to appropriately retire the existing debt. Therefore, there was one full month of the new and the old debt instruments being on our balance sheet in September causing additional interest expense. The Company did recognize approximately $147,000 of borrowings intereset expense savings since the new subordinated debt has a significantly lower cost than the old debt instruments. This interest expense savings will continue to positively impact this segment in the future. This segment also benefitted from a higher level of interest income from the securities portfolio due to a higher volume of securities. As a result of the increased level of liquidity on the Company’s balance sheet, management elected to more profitably deploy these funds into the securities portfolio as opposed to leaving them in low yielding federal funds sold. Finally, and also favorably impacting this segment was the recognition of an $84,000 security sale gain in 2021 after no gain was recognized last year.
BALANCE SHEET. The Company’s total consolidated assets of  $1.336 billion at December 31, 2021 increased by $52.8 million, or 4.1%, from the $1.283 billion level at December 31, 2020. This change was related, primarily, to increased levels of cash and cash equivalents, investment securities, loans, and other assets. Specifically, cash and cash equivalents increased $9.6 million, or 30.5%, as the Company experienced a significant influx of deposits resulting from the government stimulus programs and financial assistance provided to municipalities and school districts. Our liquidity position was also positively impacted by the Somerset County branch and deposit acquisition completed in May 2021, which provided approximately $42 million of additional deposits. These deposit increases were partially offset by the maturity of a $33 million institutional deposit late in the third quarter of 2021. Total investment securities increased $28.5 million, or 15.1%, as the steepening of the U.S. Treasury yield curve improved the yield for federal agency mortgage-backed securities and federal agency bonds, making these types of securities more attractive for purchase. The Company also continued to purchase corporate and taxable municipal securities to maintain a well-diversified portfolio. In addition, loans, net of unearned fees, and loans held for sale increased by $7.7 million, or 0.8%, as a result of the higher levels of commercial real estate and residential mortgage loan production. The overall total loan portfolio volume stabilized during the second half of the year as additional loan growth was offset by a high level of early payoff activity, particularly during the fourth quarter. Also, PPP loans continue to decline as borrowers complete the forgiveness process. Finally, other assets increased $11.8 million, or 89.4%, as a result of an increase in the positive balance of the accrued pension liability, which totaled $19.5 million and $3.0 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Due to the positive (debit) balance of the accrued pension liability, it was reclassified to other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The positive value of the accrued pension liability increased as a result of the $8.0 million contribution made in 2021 and the revaluation of the obligation due to the recognition of the settlement charge.
Total deposits increased by $84.5 million, or 8.0%, and remained significantly higher than historical levels in 2021. As previously mentioned, this robust growth is the result of the government stimulus programs and the Somerset County branch acquisition which were partially offset by the maturity of a large institutional deposit. As of December 31, 2021, the 25 largest depositors represented 18.9% of total deposits, which is a decrease from December 31, 2020 when it was 21.1%. Total borrowings have decreased by $41.2 million, or 36.2%, since year-end 2020. The decrease was driven,
primarily, by a lower level of both short-term borrowings and FHLB term advances. Specifically, at December 31, 2021, the Company had no short-term borrowings outstanding as compared to $24.7 million at December 31, 2020. In addition, FHLB term advances decreased by $22.3 million, or 34.4%, and totaled $42.7 million at December 31, 2021. The current strong liquidity position has allowed the Company to paydown short-term borrowings and FHLB advances. However, the Company continues to utilize the FHLB term advances to help manage interest rate risk. Partially offsetting the decrease in short-term and FHLB borrowings was the previously mentioned subordinated debt transaction. The Company completed a private placement of $27 million in fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes on August 26, 2021 and used approximately $20 million of the net proceeds to retire it existing subordinated debt and trust preferred securities.
The Company’s total shareholders’ equity increased by $12.2 million, or 11.6%, since year-end 2020. Capital was increased during 2021 by the Company’s $7.1 million of net income and the $8.8 million positive impact on accumulated other comprehensive loss from the recording of the settlement charge in connection with the defined benefit pension plan and the revaluation of the pension obligation. Slightly offsetting these increases was the $1.7 million common stock cash dividend and the $2.2 million negative impact experienced due to the reduced market value of the available for sale investment securities portfolio. The Company returned approximately 24% of our 2021 earnings to our shareholders through the quarterly common stock cash dividend. The Company continues to be considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes with a risk based capital ratio of 14.04% and an asset leverage ratio of 8.17% at December 31, 2021. The Company’s book value per common share was $6.82, its tangible book value per common share (non-GAAP) was $6.02 and its tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio (non-GAAP) was 7.78% at December 31, 2021.
The tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share are considered to be non-GAAP measures and are calculated by dividing tangible equity by tangible assets or shares outstanding. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide information to investors that is useful in understanding its financial condition. This non-GAAP data should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and is not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Limitations associated with non-GAAP financial measures include the risks that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items included in these measures, and, because not all companies use the same calculation of tangible common equity and tangible assets, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures calculated by other companies. The following table sets forth the calculation of the Company’s tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share at December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands, except share and ratio data):
LIQUIDITY. Although leveling off somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company’s liquidity position continues to be strong due to effective business development efforts as well as the significant influx of deposits that resulted from the government stimulus programs.. Also, deposit levels were positively impacted in the second quarter of 2021 by the Somerset County branch acquisition. In addition, the Company’s loyal core deposit base continues to prove to be a source of strength for the Company during periods of market volatility. As a result, the Company continued to experience significantly higher than historical levels of total average deposits in 2021 averaging $1.154 billion for the year. Total deposits did decrease late in the third quarter of 2021 due to the maturity of a $33 million institutional deposit that had a cost of 2.95%, which is mentioned previously in this document. The core deposit base is adequate to fund the Company’s operations. Cash flow from maturities, prepayments and amortization of securities is used to help fund loan growth. Average short-term investments increased during 2021 and continue to be higher than they have been historically which presents the challenge of profitably deploying this increased liquidity given the current low yields on short-term investment products. An additional challenge is the uncertainty regarding the duration that the increased liquidity will remain on the balance sheet which will be determined by customer behavior as the economic conditions
change. Note that management’s decision to allow the previously mentioned high cost, institutional deposit to mature in the third quarter resulted in total short-term investments declining to a more manageable level. In addition to the commercial real estate loan growth experienced during the year and greater level of residential mortgage loans being retained in the portfolio, a portion of the increased liquidity was invested in additional securities to more profitably deploy the increased funds. We strive to operate our loan to deposit ratio in a range of 80% to 100%. The Company’s loan to deposit ratio was 86.5% at December 31, 2021. The Company has ample capacity to continue to grow its loan portfolio and is strongly positioned to provide the necessary assistance to our customers and our community as they continue their recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and respond to an improving economy. We are also well positioned to service our existing loan pipeline and grow our loan to deposit ratio while remaining within our guideline parameters.
Liquidity can also be analyzed by utilizing the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $9.6 million from December 31, 2020, to $41.1 million at December 31, 2021, due to $488,000 of cash used in investing activities being more than offset by $9.9 million of cash provided by operating activities and $146,000 of cash provided by financing activities. Within financing activities, deposits increased by $42.1 million while total FHLB borrowings declined as term advances decreased by $22.3 million and short-term borrowings decreased by $24.7 million. Also, within financing activities, the $26.6 million net new subordinated debt issuance more than offset the $19.7 million redemption of the old subordinated debt and trust preferred securities. Within investing activities, cash advanced for new loans originated totaled $313.1 million and was $11.6 million higher than the $301.5 million of cash received from loan principal payments. Also, within investing activities, $77.9 million of investment securities purchases more than offset $45.5 million of proceeds from maturities of investment securities. Within operating activities, $13.8 million of mortgage loans held for sale were originated while $19.7 million of mortgage loans were sold into the secondary market.
The holding company had $9.3 million of cash, short-term investments, and investment securities at December 31, 2021. Additionally, dividend payments from our subsidiaries also provide ongoing cash to the holding company. At December 31, 2021, our subsidiary Bank had $13.1 million of cash available for immediate dividends to the holding company under applicable regulatory formulas. Management follows a policy that dividend payments from the Trust Company approximate 75% of annual net income. Overall, we believe that the holding company has good liquidity to meet its subordinated debt interest payments and its common stock dividend.
Financial institutions must maintain liquidity to meet day-to-day requirements of depositors and borrowers, take advantage of market opportunities, and provide a cushion against unforeseen needs. Liquidity needs can be met by either reducing assets or increasing liabilities. Sources of asset liquidity are provided by short-term investments, interest bearing deposits with banks, and federal funds sold. These assets totaled $41.1 million and $31.5 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Maturing and repaying loans, as well as the monthly cash flow associated with mortgage-backed securities and security maturities are other significant sources of asset liquidity for the Company.
Liability liquidity can be met by attracting deposits with competitive rates, using repurchase agreements, buying federal funds, or utilizing the facilities of the Federal Reserve or the FHLB systems. The Company utilizes a variety of these methods of liability liquidity. Additionally, the Company’s subsidiary bank is a member of the FHLB, which provides the opportunity to obtain short- to longer-term advances based upon the Company’s investment in certain residential mortgage, commercial real estate, and commercial and industrial loans. At December 31, 2021, the Company had $365 million of overnight borrowing availability at the FHLB, $32 million of short-term borrowing availability at the Federal Reserve Bank and $35 million of unsecured federal funds lines with correspondent banks. The Company believes it has ample liquidity available to fund outstanding loan commitments if they were fully drawn upon.
CAPITAL RESOURCES. The Bank meaningfully exceeds all regulatory capital ratios for each of the periods presented and is considered well capitalized. The Company’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 10.29%, the tier 1 capital ratio was 10.29%, and the total capital ratio was 14.04% at December 31, 2021. The Company’s tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.17% at December 31, 2021. Total regulatory capital was favorably impacted by the August 26, 2021 issuance of $27 million of subordinated debt as described in Note 24, Regulatory Capital. We anticipate that we will maintain our strong capital ratios throughout 2022.
Capital generated from earnings will be utilized to pay the common stock cash dividend and will support controlled balance sheet growth. Our common dividend payout ratio for the full year 2021 was 24.4%. Total Parent Company cash was $9.3 million at December 31, 2021. There is a particular emphasis on ensuring that the subsidiary bank has appropriate levels of capital to support its non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan concentration, which stood at
347% of regulatory capital at December 31, 2021. It should be noted that this ratio improved from 348% at December 31, 2020 even though total non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans grew between years. The improvement in this ratio is a direct result of the Parent Company downstreaming $3.5 million of capital to the Bank. The greater level of capital at the Bank creates additional capacity for future non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan growth. Additionally, while we work through the COVID-19 pandemic, our focus is on preserving capital to support customer lending and allow the Company to take advantage of opportunities that should result from the continued improvement in the economy. We currently believe that we have sufficient capital and earnings power to continue to pay our common stock cash dividend at its current rate of $0.025 per quarter. At December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately 17.1 million common shares outstanding.
The Basel III capital standards establish the minimum capital levels in addition to the well capitalized requirements under the federal banking regulations prompt corrective action. The capital rules also impose a 2.5% capital conservation buffer (CCB) on top of the three minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. Banking institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios once the CCB is taken into account will be subject to constraints on capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, and certain discretionary executive compensation. The severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution’s “eligible retained income” (four quarter trailing net income, net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income). The Company and the Bank meet all capital requirements, including the CCB, and continue to be committed to maintaining strong capital levels that exceed regulatory requirements while also supporting balance sheet growth and providing a return to our shareholders.
Under the Basel III capital standards, the minimum capital ratios are:
INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY. Asset/liability management involves managing the risks associated with changing interest rates and the resulting impact on the Company’s net interest income, net income and capital. The management and measurement of interest rate risk at the Company is performed by using the following tools: (i) simulation modeling, which analyzes the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income, net income and capital levels over specific future time periods. The simulation modeling forecasts earnings under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, prepayments and changes in the volumes and rates of various loan and deposit categories. The simulation modeling incorporates assumptions about reinvestment and the repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities without stated contractual maturities; (ii) market value of portfolio equity sensitivity analysis; and (iii) static GAP analysis, which analyzes the extent to which interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities are matched at specific points in time. The overall interest rate risk position and strategies are reviewed by senior management and the Company’s Board of Directors on an ongoing basis.
The following table presents a summary of the Company’s static GAP positions at December 31, 2021:
When December 31, 2021 is compared to December 31, 2020, the Company’s cumulative GAP ratio through one year indicates that the Company’s balance sheet is still asset sensitive and the level of asset sensitivity increased between years. We continue to see loan customer preference for fixed rate loans given the low overall level of interest rates. The Company demonstrated significantly higher than historical levels of both loans and deposits in 2021. This growth is due to successful business development efforts, the impact from the government stimulus programs and the 2021 Somerset County branch acquisition. The growth experienced in the loan portfolio, investment securities, and short-term assets was funded by the increase in total deposits. In addition, there was a significant decrease in overnight borrowings which are immediately impacted by changes to national interest rates. Even though the balance of FHLB term advances at December 31, 2021 decreased $22.3 million, or 34.4%, from the prior year, the Company continues to utilize such advances to help manage our interest rate risk position.
Management places primary emphasis on simulation modeling to manage and measure interest rate risk. The Company’s asset/liability management policy seeks to limit net interest income variability over the first twelve months of the forecast period to -5.0% and -7.5%, which include interest rate movements of 100 and 200 basis points, respectively. Additionally, the Company also uses market value sensitivity measures to further evaluate the balance sheet exposure to changes in interest rates. The Company monitors the trends in market value of portfolio equity sensitivity analysis on a quarterly basis.
The following table presents an analysis of the sensitivity inherent in the Company’s net interest income and market value of portfolio equity. The interest rate scenarios in the table compare the Company’s base forecast, which was prepared using a flat interest rate scenario, to scenarios that reflect immediate interest rate changes of 100 and 200 basis points. Note that we suspended the 200 basis point downward rate shock since it has little value due to the absolute low
level of interest rates. Each rate scenario contains unique prepayment and repricing assumptions that are applied to the Company’s existing balance sheet that was developed under the flat interest rate scenario.
The Company believes that its overall interest rate risk position is well controlled. The variability of net interest income is positive in the upward rate shocks due to the Company’s short duration investment securities portfolio and the scheduled repricing of loans tied to an index, such as LIBOR or prime. Also, the Company has effectively utilized interest rate swaps for interest rate risk management purposes. The interest rate swaps allow our customers to lock in low interest rates while the Company retains the benefit of interest rates moving with the market. Regarding interest bearing liabilities, management continues its disciplined approach to price its core deposit accounts in a controlled but competitive manner. The variability of net interest income is negative in the 100 basis point downward rate scenario as the Company has more exposure to assets repricing downward to a greater extent than liabilities due to the absolute low level of interest rates with the fed funds rate currently at a targeted range of 0% to 0.25%. The market value of portfolio equity increases in the upward rate shocks due to the improved value of the Company’s core deposit base. Negative variability of market value of portfolio equity occurs in the downward rate shock due to a reduced value for core deposits.
Within the investment portfolio at December 31, 2021, 75.0% of the portfolio is classified as available for sale and 25.0% as held to maturity. The available for sale classification provides management with greater flexibility to manage the securities portfolio to better achieve overall balance sheet rate sensitivity goals and provide liquidity if needed. The mark to market of the available for sale securities does inject more volatility in the book value of equity, but has no impact on regulatory capital. There are 89 securities that are temporarily impaired at December 31, 2021. The Company reviews its securities quarterly and has asserted that at December 31, 2021, the impaired value of securities represents temporary declines due to movements in interest rates and the Company does have the ability and intent to hold those securities to maturity or to allow a market recovery. Furthermore, it is the Company’s intent to manage its long-term interest rate risk by continuing to sell a portion of newly originated fixed-rate 30-year mortgage loans into the secondary market (excluding construction and any jumbo loans). The Company also sells 15-year fixed-rate mortgage loans into the secondary market as well, depending on market conditions. For the year 2021, 21.1% of all residential mortgage loan production was sold into the secondary market. The Company revised strategy in 2021 and retained a higher percentage of our residential mortgage loan production in the loan portfolio as opposed to selling into the secondary market. This strategic change allowed us to more profitably deploy a portion of the increased liquidity that we have on our balance sheet.
The amount of loans outstanding by category as of December 31, 2021, which are due in (i) one year or less, (ii) more than one year through five years, (iii) more than five years through 15 years, and (iv) over 15 years, are shown in the following table. Loan balances are also categorized according to their sensitivity to changes in interest rates.
The loan maturity information is based upon original loan terms and is not adjusted for principal paydowns and rollovers. In the ordinary course of business, loans maturing within one year may be renewed, in whole or in part, as to principal amount at interest rates prevailing at the date of renewal.
The following table presents the total loans due after one year that have predetermined (fixed) interest rates and floating interest rates as of December 31, 2021.
OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS. The Company incurs off-balance sheet risks in the normal course of business in order to meet the financing needs of its customers. These risks derive from commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such commitments and standby letters of credit involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to these commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by their contractual amounts. The Company uses the same credit and collateral policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as for all other lending. The Company had various outstanding commitments to extend credit approximating $216.6 million and standby letters of credit of  $13.1 million as of December 31, 2021. The Company can also use various interest rate contracts, such as interest rate swaps, caps, floors and swaptions to help manage interest rate and market valuation risk exposure, which is incurred in normal recurrent banking activities. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $134.6 million in the notional amount of interest rate
swaps outstanding, with a fair value of $1.2 million. In addition, the Company entered into a risk participation agreement (RPA) with the lead bank of a commercial real estate loan arrangement. As a participating bank, the Company guarantees the performance on a borrower-related interest rate swap contract. The notional amount of the RPA outstanding at December 31, 2021 was $2.5 million, with a fair value of zero.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, municipal deposit letters of credit issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh on behalf of AmeriServ Financial Bank naming applicable municipalities as beneficiaries totaled $62.2 million and $61.3 million, respectively. The letters of credit serve as collateral, in place of pledged securities, for municipal deposits maintained at AmeriServ Financial Bank.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES. The accounting and reporting policies of the Company are in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and conform to general practices within the banking industry. Accounting and reporting policies for the pension liability, allowance for loan losses, intangible assets, income taxes, and investment securities are deemed critical because they involve the use of estimates and require significant management judgments. Application of assumptions different than those used by the Company could result in material changes in the Company’s financial position or results of operation.
ACCOUNT - Pension liability
BALANCE SHEET REFERENCE - Other assets
INCOME STATEMENT REFERENCE - Salaries and employee benefits and Other expense
DESCRIPTION
Pension costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, benefits earned, interest costs, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation of future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the Company’s pension obligations and future expense. Additionally, pension expense can also be impacted by settlement accounting charges if the amount of employee selected lump sum distributions exceed the total amount of service and interest component costs of the net periodic pension cost in a particular year. Our pension benefits are described further in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
ACCOUNT - Allowance for loan losses
BALANCE SHEET REFERENCE - Allowance for loan losses
INCOME STATEMENT REFERENCE - Provision for loan losses
DESCRIPTION
The allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining reserve levels believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable credit losses. Management’s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the credit portfolio and other relevant factors. However, this quarterly evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates, including, among others, likelihood of customer default, loss given default, exposure at default, the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, value of collateral, estimated losses on consumer loans and residential mortgages, and general amounts for historical loss experience. This process also considers economic conditions, uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the various credit portfolios. All of these factors may be susceptible to significant change. Also, the allocation of the allowance for credit losses to specific loan pools is based on historical loss trends and management’s judgment concerning those trends.
Commercial and commercial real estate loans are the largest category of credits and the most sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the allowance for loan losses. Approximately $9.5 million, or 76%, of the total allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2021 has been allocated to these two loan categories. This allocation also considers other relevant factors such as actual versus estimated losses, economic trends, delinquencies, levels of non-performing and troubled debt restructured (TDR) loans, concentrations of credit, trends in loan volume, experience and depth of management, examination and audit results, effects of any changes in lending policies and trends in policy, financial information and documentation exceptions. To the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates, additional provision for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods.
ACCOUNT - Intangible assets
BALANCE SHEET REFERENCE - Intangible assets
INCOME STATEMENT REFERENCE - Other expense
DESCRIPTION
The Company considers our accounting policies related to goodwill and core deposit intangible to be critical because the assumptions or judgment used in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in past acquisitions are subjective and complex. As a result, changes in these assumptions or judgment could have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
The fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, including the resulting goodwill and core deposit intangible, was based either on quoted market prices or provided by other third party sources, when available. When third party information was not available, estimates were made in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques. The assumptions that were used in the cash flow modeling were subjective and are susceptible to significant changes. The Company routinely utilizes the services of an independent third party that is regarded within the banking industry as an expert in valuing core deposits to monitor the ongoing value and changes in the Company’s core deposit base. These core deposit valuation updates are based upon specific data provided from statistical analysis of the Company’s own deposit behavior to estimate the duration of these non-maturity deposits combined with market interest rates and other economic factors.
Goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired. The Company’s goodwill relates to value inherent in the banking and wealth management businesses, and the value is dependent upon the Company’s ability to provide quality, cost-effective services in the face of free competition from other market participants on a regional basis. This ability relies upon continuing investments in processing systems, the development of value-added service features and the ease of use of the Company’s services. As such, goodwill value is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted and the loyalty of the Company’s deposit and customer base over a longer time frame. The quality and value of a Company’s assets is also an important factor to consider when performing goodwill impairment testing. A decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost-effective value added services over sustained periods can lead to the impairment of goodwill.
Goodwill which has an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment at least annually and written down and charged to results of operations only in periods in which the recorded value is more than the estimated fair value. The core deposit intangible, which is a wasting asset, is amortized and reported in other expense for a period of ten years using the sum of the years digits amortization method.
ACCOUNT - Income taxes
BALANCE SHEET REFERENCE - Net deferred tax asset and Net deferred tax liability
INCOME STATEMENT REFERENCE - Provision for income taxes
DESCRIPTION
The provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes both currently payable and deferred. The changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the changes in differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that management estimates will be in effect when the differences reverse. This income tax review is completed on a quarterly basis.
In relation to recording the provision for income taxes, management must estimate the future tax rates applicable to the reversal of tax differences, make certain assumptions regarding whether tax differences are permanent or temporary and the related timing of the expected reversal. Also, estimates are made as to whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. Alternatively, we may make estimates about the potential usage of deferred tax assets that decrease our valuation allowances. As of December 31, 2021, we believe that all of the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be recovered and that no valuation allowances were needed.
In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to
which, additional taxes will be due. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We record an additional charge in our provision for income taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be.
ACCOUNT - Investment securities
BALANCE SHEET REFERENCE - Investment securities
INCOME STATEMENT REFERENCE - Net realized gains on investment securities
DESCRIPTION
Available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities are reviewed quarterly for possible other-than-temporary impairment. The review includes an analysis of the facts and circumstances of each individual investment such as the severity of loss, the length of time the fair value has been below cost, the expectation for that security’s performance, the creditworthiness of the issuer and the Company’s intent and ability to hold the security to recovery. A decline in value that is considered to be other-than-temporary is recorded as a loss within non-interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. At December 31, 2021, the unrealized losses in the available-for-sale security portfolio were comprised of securities issued by government agencies or government sponsored agencies and certain high quality corporate and taxable municipal securities. The Company believes the unrealized losses are primarily a result of increases in market yields from the time of purchase. In general, as market yields rise, the value of securities will decrease; as market yields fall, the fair value of securities will increase. Management generally views changes in fair value caused by changes in interest rates as temporary; therefore, these securities have not been classified as other-than-temporarily impaired. Management has also concluded that based on current information we expect to continue to receive scheduled interest payments as well as the entire principal balance. Furthermore, management does not intend to sell these securities and does not believe it will be required to sell these securities before they recover in value.
