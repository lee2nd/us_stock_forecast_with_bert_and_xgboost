ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
OVERVIEW
The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 14, 2009 and has established a fiscal year end of June 30.
CASH FLOWS
Our financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our company obtaining additional capital to fund operating losses until we become profitable. If we are unable to obtain additional capital, we could be forced to significantly curtail or cease operations.
We have only realized nominal revenues from our business. In the next 12 months, we plan to identify business to whom we can license and/or distribute our brand and product(s) as well as seek additional opportunities to continue as a going concern.
COVID-19
In December 2019, a novel strain of COVID-19 was reported in China. Since then, the COVID-19 has spread globally including across North America and the United States. The spread of COVID-19 from China to other countries has resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the outbreak of COVID-19 as a “pandemic,” or a worldwide spread of a new disease, on March 11, 2020.
Specifically, we caution that our business could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to the outbreak of COVID-19. To date, COVID has directly impacted the ability we have to participate in trade show events and other in-person marketing. Although retailers which may carry our products may be considered essential businesses and therefore be allowed to remain operational, they may experience significantly reduced demand. The risk of a pandemic, or public perception of the risk, could cause customers to avoid public places, including retail properties, and could cause temporary or long-term disruptions in our supply chains and/or delays in the delivery of our inventory to our customers. Further, such risks could also adversely affect retail customers’ financial condition, resulting in reduced spending on our products, which are marketed as premium products. “Shelter-in-place” or other such orders by governmental entities could also disrupt our operations, if our employees or the employees of our sourcing partners who cannot perform their responsibilities from home, are not able to report to work. Risks related to an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis, such as COVID-19, could also lead to the complete or partial closure of one or more of our co-packing facilities or operations of our sourcing partners.

The following table provides selected financial data about our company for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.
GOING CONCERN
Artisan Consumer Goods, Inc. currently has limited operations. Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion for Artisan Consumer Goods, Inc. which includes a statement raising substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our cash balance was $13,555 and working capital was $(226,408) at June 30, 2022. Total expenditures over the next 12 months are expected to be approximately $100,000. If we experience a shortage of funds prior to generating revenues from operations we may utilize funds from our directors, who have informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for operating costs, however they have no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to us. Management believes our current cash balance will not be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months.
As at June 30, 2022, our total assets were $28,904 were comprised of cash for $13,555, $8,224 for inventory, intellectual property of $6,125 (net of accumulated amortization) and trademarks for $1,000. The intellectual property and trademarks resulted from our July 15, 2021 acquisition of the Within / Without Granola brand.
As at June 30, 2022, our current liabilities of $248,187 were comprised of account payable of $45,685, accrued liabilities for $48,286 and related party loans of $154,216. As at June 30, 2022, our stockholders’ deficiency was $(219,283).
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. Net cash used in operations was $(29,065) and $(14,508) for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
For the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, net cash flows used by investing activities was $10,000 and $-0-, respectively, from our asset purchase of Within / Without Granola on July 15, 2021.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, net cash flows provided by financing activities was $51,719 and $10,000, respectively from related party cash advances.
PLAN OF OPERATION
Our plan of operation for the following twelve months is as follows:
On July 15, 2021, we acquired the assets of Paleo Scavenger, LLC for $10,000. Paleo owns the Within / Without Granola (“WWG”) brand. The purchase price includes the WWG trademarks, brands, books, records, intellectual property, commercial sales channel, customer lists and manufacturing rights. Early in 2021, WWG ceased operations and we restarted the manufacturing process in June 2022.
We generated our first sales since inception during August 2022 of approximately $600. We are currently selling our granola products on Shopify. In addition, we are in the process of qualifying to sell our products on Amazon.
We must raise at least $100,000 to commence our plan of operation, described above, and fund our ongoing operational expenses. We have no assurance that future financing will materialize. If that financing is not available, we may be unable to continue our operations. Management believes that if we are successful in raising $100,000, we will be able to generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof. However, if such financing is not available, we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements. We have no assurance that future financing will materialize. Management believes that if subsequent private placements are successful, we will be able to generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof. However, additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements.
If we are unsuccessful in raising at least $100,000 through a private placement, we will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing, which would be highly difficult for a new, development stage business to obtain. Therefore, the Company is highly dependent upon the success of an anticipated private placement offering and failure thereof would result in the Company having to seek capital from other sources such as debt financing, which may not even be available to the Company. However, if such financing were available, because we are a development stage company with little in the way of operations to date, we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high-risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate. If and when these funds are obtained, management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth and manage the debt load. If we cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of our common stock or secure debt financing, we would be required to cease business operations and as a result, investors in our common stock would lose all of their investment.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
