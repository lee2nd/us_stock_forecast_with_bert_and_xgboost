RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Financial results for the first three quarters of 2021 improved dramatically over the same period in 2020 which was adversely impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic. Although the pandemic continued to present many challenges in 2021, as of September 30, 2021, sales had increased $6,899,836, or 35.7%, compared to the same period in 2020. Ongoing supply chain disruptions weighed heavily on demand from our automotive sector customers during the fourth quarter even as overall economic activity improved. As a result, sales in the fourth quarter of 2021 were limited to $7,749,488 compared to $8,265,419 a year earlier, a decline of $515,931, or 6.2%. The combination of lower sales and higher costs in the quarter resulted in a reduction in fourth quarter net income compared to a year earlier. Net income was $81,178, or $0.08 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $464,263, or $0.48 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2020. For the full year 2021, net sales were $33,974,558 compared to $27,590,653 in 2020, an increase of $6,383,905, or 23.1%. Net sales in 2021 reflect an increase of $1,101,556, or 3.4%, compared to the $32,873,002 reported in 2019. Full year net income in 2021 was $1,113,472, or $1.15 per share, compared to $50,450, or $0.05 per share, in 2020 and net income of $538,314, or $0.56 per share, in 2019.
2021 Compared to 2020
Fastener segment revenues were $6,988,047 in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $7,332,308 reported in the fourth quarter of 2020, a decline of $344,261, or 4.7%. The decline was primarily due to the ongoing computer chip shortage and transportation bottlenecks that have constrained automotive production. During the fourth quarter, sales to automotive customers declined $795,623, which more than offset an increase in sales to non-automotive customers of $451,362. Fastener segment revenues for the full year 2021 were $29,831,388 compared to $24,607,863 in 2020, an increase of $5,223,525, or 21.2%. The full year increase in fastener segment sales is primarily due to the strong rebound in demand from the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The automotive sector is the primary market for our fastener segment products and much of that sector was idled for an extended period of time during the second quarter of 2020 due to the pandemic. Total sales to automotive customers in 2021 increased $1,960,855, or 12.6%, compared to 2020. Sales to our non-automotive customers increased $3,262,670, or 36.3%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The net decline in sales in the fourth quarter of 2021, combined with worsening inflation, resulted in lower fastener segment gross margin of $1,072,310 compared to $1,638,836 in the year earlier quarter, a decline of $566,526. For the full year 2021, fastener segment gross margins were $5,185,956 compared to $4,170,276 in 2020, an increase of $1,015,680. The increase in sales for the full year 2021 was the primary factor impacting gross margins for the year.
Assembly equipment segment revenues were $761,441 in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to $933,111 in the fourth quarter of 2020, a decline of $171,670, or 18.4%. For the full year 2021, assembly equipment segment revenues were $4,143,170, compared to $2,982,790 reported in 2020, an increase of $1,160,380, or 38.9%. Assembly equipment segment sales in 2021 were the highest annual total since 2007 as the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic took hold. Gross margins declined in the fourth quarter of 2021 to $195,237 from $255,296 in the fourth quarter of 2020, due to lower sales volume and due to 2020 revenue being more heavily weighted towards higher margin custom machine sales. For the full year 2021, assembly equipment segment gross margins improved, along with sales, to $1,279,136 from $744,926 in 2020.
Selling and administrative expenses were $5,106,177 in 2021 compared to $4,998,216 in 2020, an increase of $107,961, or 2.2%. The increase was primarily due to a $79,469 increase in commission expense related to the higher sales in 2021. The remaining net change relates to various smaller items. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 15.0% in 2021 compared to 18.1% in 2020.
Other income was $55,557 in 2021 compared to $148,464 in 2020. Other income is primarily comprised of interest income which declined during the year due to lower interest rates and lower invested balances.
The Company’s effective income tax rates were 21.3% and 22.9% in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
DIVIDENDS
In determining to pay dividends, the Board considers current profitability, the outlook for longer-term profitability, known and potential cash requirements and the overall financial condition of the Company. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the Company reduced the regular quarterly dividend from $0.22 per share to $0.10 per share. The dividend was restored to the pre-pandemic amount in February 2021. The Company paid four regular quarterly dividends in 2021 totaling $0.88 per share. On February 21, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share, payable March 18, 2022 to shareholders of record on March 4, 2022. This continues the uninterrupted record of consecutive quarterly dividends paid by the Company to its shareholders that extends over 88 years.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Capital expenditures during 2021 were $670,898. Of the total, $493,564 related to fastener segment activities, including cold heading equipment additions of $62,600, secondary processing equipment of $360,588 and general plant equipment additions of $70,376. Additional investments of $177,334 were made in 2021 for facilities improvements that benefit both the assembly equipment segment and the fastener segment.
Total capital expenditures in 2020 were $824,136. Fastener segment additions accounted for $614,835 of the total, including $410,114 for cold heading and screw machine equipment, $97,908 for inspection equipment and $40,000 for equipment to perform secondary operations on parts. The remaining $66,813 of fastener segment additions consisted of parts cleaning and material handling equipment. Assembly equipment segment additions in 2020 were $13,924 for production equipment. Investments for the benefit of both operating segments, primarily for building improvements, totaled $195,377 during 2020.
Depreciation expense was $1,318,554 in 2021 and $1,347,305 in 2020.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Working capital at December 31, 2021 was $17,421,585, an increase of $855,296 from the beginning of the year. The net change was primarily due to an increase in inventory of $3,366,486 which was only partially offset by a reduction in cash, cash equivalents and certificates of deposit of $2,522,777. In addition to higher prices for raw materials, the increase in inventory was due to accelerated purchases in anticipation of further price increases and to manage the impact of supply chain disruptions. The Company’s investing activities in 2021 included the net maturities of certificates of deposit of $1,992,000 and capital expenditures of $670,898. The only financing activity during 2021 was the payment of $850,196 in dividends. The Company's holdings in cash, cash equivalents and certificates of deposit amounted to $4,777,954 at the end of 2021.
Management believes that current cash, cash equivalents and operating cash flow will be sufficient to provide adequate working capital for the next twelve months.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company has not entered into, and has no current plans to enter into, any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience, current trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and judgments required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as appropriate based on changing conditions. A summary of critical accounting policies can be found in Note 1 of the financial statements.
Critical accounting estimates are those that require application of management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. We have reviewed our accounting estimates, and none were deemed to be considered critical for the accounting periods presented. While we apply our judgment based on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could vary from these assumptions. Additionally, future facts and circumstances could change and impact our estimates and assumptions.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
The Company’s financial statements and financial condition were not, and are not expected to be, materially impacted by new, or proposed, accounting standards. A summary of recent accounting pronouncements can be found in Note 1 of the financial statements.
OUTLOOK FOR 2022
As we entered 2021, the introduction of vaccines offered hope of a continued rebound from the pandemic-induced recession and a return to more stable operations. Instead, in addition to ongoing COVID-19 related challenges, we were faced with labor market shortages, supply chain disruptions and inflation at a rate not seen in decades. All these factors resulted in much higher operating costs and operational challenges. Nevertheless, financial results in 2021 were more positive than those of 2020 and 2019.
As we begin 2022, both our fastener segment and our assembly equipment segment have seen stable demand. However, demand from automotive sector customers, our primary customer market, continues to be constrained as a shortage of computer chips limits their production activities. These shortages are expected to persist in the near-term which would negatively impact demand from such customers. The current high rate of inflation is particularly concerning as it has impacted not only raw materials, but also labor, energy, transportation and other inputs related to production. Our efforts to pass on these increases have resulted in some success, but continue to be challenged. We have also had difficulties maintaining staffing at ideal levels due to the tight labor market. These factors, as well as the uncertainties that COVID-19 still presents, are expected to continue to be obstacles in the near-term.
Our healthy financial condition has allowed us to successfully navigate the difficult operating environment brought on by the pandemic and should provide a sound basis for future activities. We were able to increase our investment in equipment in 2021 compared to the previous year and expect to make additional investments in 2022 as one means to maintain competitiveness. We will also continue our efforts to develop new customer relationships and build on existing ones in all the markets we serve by emphasizing our experience, quality and customer service in a very competitive global marketplace.
The positive results in the past year and our success in a uniquely challenging environment would not have been possible without the conscientious efforts of our dedicated employees, who consistently strive to exceed our customers’ expectations related to quality, price and service. We are grateful for their contributions as well as for the loyalty of our customers that have placed their confidence in us to help them achieve their goals. We also take this opportunity to thank our shareholders for their continued support.
