Business Overview
BioCorRx Inc., through its subsidiaries, develops and provides innovative treatment programs for substance abuse and related disorders. The BioCorRx® Recovery Program is a non-addictive, medication-assisted treatment (MAT) program for substance abuse that includes peer recovery support. The UnCraveRx™ Weight Loss Management Program is a medically assisted weight management program that is combined with a virtual platform application. The Company is also engaged in the research and development of sustained release naltrexone products for the treatment of addiction and other possible disorders. Specifically, the company is developing its product candidate (BICX101) a sustained release, injectable naltrexone for the treatment of opioid abuse and alcoholism. The company is also developing an implantable naltrexone treatment (BICX104) a long-acting naltrexone implant that can last several months for the treatment of opioid dependence and alcohol use disorders with the goal of future regulatory approval with the Food and Drug Administration.
The BioCorRx® Recovery Program is a comprehensive addiction program which includes peer support and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) modules (typically completed in 16 sessions on average but not limited to), coupled with a naltrexone implant. CBT is an evidence based method that can be used to change thoughts, feelings, behaviors and improve overall life satisfaction. The implant is specifically compounded with a prescription from a medical doctor for each individual and is designed to release naltrexone into the body over multiple months. The naltrexone implant means a single administration, long acting naltrexone pellet(s) that consists of a naltrexone formulation in a biodegradable form that is suitable for subcutaneous implantation in a particular patient.
BioCorRx is not a licensed health care provider and does not provide health care services to patients. BioCorRx does not operate substance abuse clinics. BioCorRx makes the BioCorRx Recovery Program and UnCraveRx® Weight Loss Management Program available to health care providers to utilize when the health care provider determines it is medically appropriate and indicated for his or her patients. Any physician or medical professional is solely responsible for treatment options prescribed or recommended to his or her patients. At all times, such providers retain complete and exclusive authority, responsibility, supervision and control over their medical practice, their patients, the treatment that their patients receive and any decision to prescribe the implant to any of the provider’s patients.
BioCorRx does not condition its license to health care providers accessing the implant on their making available the Counseling Program to the providers’ patients although BioCorRx certainly encourages that providers do so.
BioCorRx has issued several license and distribution agreements to several unrelated third parties involving the establishment of alcoholism and opioid addiction rehabilitation and treatment centers and creating certain addiction rehabilitation programs. There are 15 licensed providers throughout the United States that offer the BioCorRx Recovery Program and 12 providers throughout the United States that offer the UnCraveRx® Weight Loss Management Program. The company’s current focus will continue on wider distribution across the United States, branding of the BioCorRx Recovery Program and acquisition of healthcare related products and services. The Company is committed to continuing to provide excellent rehabilitation products and related services to healthcare providers nationwide as it expands the distribution of the BioCorRx Recovery Program and UnCraveRx® Weight Loss Management Program to a network of independent licensed clinics and licensed healthcare professionals.
The Company’s subsidiary, BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals, is focused on acquiring and the development of products for the treatment of addiction and other possible disorders. Specifically, the company is developing injectable and implantable naltrexone with the goal of future regulatory approval with the Food and Drug Administration. The Company’s pipeline includes BICX101 for the treatment of opioid addiction and alcoholism as well as BICX104 for the same indications.
In August 2017, the Company announced that it had decided to seek U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) approval on BICX102 in advance of BICX101. Product candidate BICX102 is a long-acting naltrexone implant that can last several months being developed for opioid dependence and alcohol use disorders. The pre-IND meeting date for BICX102 took place on January 24, 2018. On February 12, 2018, the Company announced that the FDA deemed the 505(b)(2) pathway as an acceptable route for approval for BICX102; the Company plans to apply for dual indications, both opioid use disorder and alcohol use disorder, within the same application. A grant application was submitted to the National Institutes of Health on May 14, 2018 for funding the development and study plans for BICX102. On January 17, 2019, the Company received a Notice of Award from the United States Department of Health and Human Services for a grant from the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) in support of BICX102 from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The grant provided for (i) $2,842,430 in funding during the first year and (ii) $2,831,838 during the second year subject to the terms and conditions specified in the grant, including satisfactory progress of project and the availability of funds. In January 2020, the Company was awarded a second year of funding from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (“NIDA”) to support the development of a 3-month implantable depot pellet of naltrexone for the treatment of Opioid Use Disorder, which the Company refers to as BICX102. The grant provided for $2,831,838 during the second year subject to the terms and conditions specified in the grant, including satisfactory progress of project and availability of funds. On August 27, 2021, the Company received a Notice of award from the United States Department of Health and Human Services for a grant from National Institute on Drug Abuse. The grant provides for $3,453,367 in funding during the third year subject to the terms and conditions specified in the grant, including satisfactory progress of project and the availability of funds. Grant receivables were $56,359 and $224,879 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Deferred revenues related to the grant were $0 and $65,560 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. $835,924 and $4,464,626 was recorded as grant income during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The UnCraveRx® Weight Loss Management Program is a comprehensive 3-month medically assisted weight management program that helps to reduce food cravings combined with on-demand virtual lifestyle support, fitness and nutrition.
If determined medically appropriate by a patient’s treating physician and under his/her medical supervision, an anti-craving medication may be prescribed to help reduce food cravings. The benefits of using the anti-craving time released mediation is that it may aid in compliance. BioCorRx® does not sell, manufacture, or compound any drugs or pharmaceuticals for the program.
Training is required to assist the treating physician in making the best medical decision regarding the use of the anti-craving medication and determine whether the program is right for the patient.

The reasons for the decrease in 2021 are primarily due to a decrease of $2,667,908 in research and development expense and conclusion of the preclinical studies of BICX102, from $4,273,815 for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $1,605,907 for the year ended December 31, 2021, and a decrease of $145,525 in stock-based compensation related to both directors and service providers due to certain stock options that were fully amortized in 2021, from $355,040 for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $209,515 for the year ended December 31, 2021, offset by an increase of $369,520 in accounting and legal fees due to additional legal services used in 2021 in connection with the drafting and filing of the Company’s SEC filings, from $409,998 for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $779,518 for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $208,640 in consulting fees due to increased consulting services, from $567,009 for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $775,648 for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $141,480 in impairment of intellectual property due to the Company’s assessment that the it is more likely than not that the fair value of intellectual property is less than its carrying value, from $0 for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $141,480 for the year ended December 31, 2021, and an increase of $111,446 in payroll expense due to the increased number of employees to support the Company’s growth of business and a replacement of the payment of consulting fees with the payment of annual base salary in accordance with the Company’s normal payroll schedule, from $871,943 for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $983,389 for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Interest Expense
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $565,684 and $510,959, respectively. The increase is mainly due to the issuance of note payables with a stated interest rate of 25% per annum.
Grant Income
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized grant income of $835,924 as compared to $4,464,626 for the comparable period last year. The larger grant income in 2020 was due to: (i) the advancement of preclinical studies with the development of a 3-month implantable depot pellet of naltrexone for the treatment of Opioid Use Disorder, which the Company refers to as BICX102 and (ii) the award of second year funding from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (“NIDA”) providing for $2,831,838. During preclinical investigations of our Naltrexone implantable pellets, it was observed that the inclusion of Triamcinolone Acetonide as an anti-inflammatory adjuvant in BICX102 was not beneficial. Therefore, we progressed the development of BICX104, which contains only Naltrexone as an active ingredient. On May 7, 2021, the FDA cleared the Company’s Investigational New Drug Application (IND) application for BICX104. On August 27, 2021, the Company received a Notice of award from the United States Department of Health and Human Services for a grant from National Institute on Drug Abuse. The grant provides for $3,453,367 in funding during the third year subject to the terms and conditions specified in the grant, including satisfactory progress of project and the availability of funds. The funds are available to reimburse the Company for certain incurred direct costs and 17% of indirect costs. Indirect costs are costs that are not directly related to the project itself but are required to conduct the research and are critical to the success of the project and organization as a whole.
Net Loss
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company experienced a net loss of $5,210,638 compared with a net loss of $3,506,507 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net loss is primarily due to the lower grant income incurred in 2021.

There can be no guarantee or assurance that the Company can raise adequate capital from outside sources. If the Company is unable to raise funds when required or on acceptable terms, it has to significantly scale back, or discontinue its operations.
Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $3,537,658 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $2,151,872 used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the increased net loss in 2021.
Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $49,997 compared to $9,227 used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to purchase on equipment and costs on software development during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Net Cash Flow from Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $2,974,140, from $107,300 provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $3,081,440 cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Going Concern
The Company’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern. This contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had a working capital deficit of $(4,158,118), and an accumulated deficit of $69,896,565. The Company has not yet generated any significant revenues, and has incurred net losses since inception. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve-month period since the date of the financial statements were issued.
The Company believes that its current cash on hand will not be sufficient to fund its projected operating requirements for the next twelve months since the date of the issuance of the financial statements.
The Company will be dependent upon the raising of additional capital through placement of its common stock in order to implement the Company’s business plan or by using outside financing. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these situations in order to continue as a going concern. The Company is funding its operations by additional borrowings and some shareholder advances.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, sales or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to an investment in its securities.
