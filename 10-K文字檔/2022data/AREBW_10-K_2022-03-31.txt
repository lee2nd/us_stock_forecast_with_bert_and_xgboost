Operations
On June 9, 2016, a change in control occurred, a sixty percent (60%) ownership interest was obtained by American Rebel, Inc. from our former officer and director and founder. On June 17, 2017, the Company acquired the business of its control stockholder accounted for and presented financially as a reverse merger transaction. Our majority stockholder, American Rebel, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and we distributed shares to the stockholders of American Rebel, Inc. As a result of this reverse merger, the reported operating history of the Company is now the operating history of American Rebel, Inc. Financial statements of both companies are now consolidated and all material intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated.
Recent Developments
On February 9, 2022, we closed on an underwritten public offering of 2,530,121 units (the “Common Units”), at a price to the public of $4.15 per Common Unit, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $10.5 million, prior to deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other estimated offering expenses. Each Common Unit consisted of one share of Common Stock and one warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock (each a “Warrant” and collectively the “Warrants”). The Common Stock and Warrants were immediately separable from the Common Units and were issued and trade separately. The Warrants are exercisable immediately, expire five years from the date of issuance and have an exercise price of $5.1875 per share.
We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay various outstanding indebtedness and for general corporate purposes, including working capital, increased research and development expenditures and funding our growth strategies.
Description of Business
Company Overview
American Rebel is boldly positioning itself as America’s Patriotic Brand. The Company has identified the market opportunity to design, manufacture, and market innovative concealed carry products and safes. American Rebel accesses its market uniquely through its positioning as America’s Patriotic Brand and the appeal of its products as well as through the profile and public persona of its founder and CEO, Andy Ross. Andy hosted his own television show for 12 years, has made multiple appearances over the years at trade shows, and is well-known in the archery world as the founder of Ross Archery, which was the world’s fastest-growing bow company in 2007 and 2008. Andy has also released 3 CDs, done numerous radio and print interviews, and performed many concerts in front of thousands of people. Andy has the ability to present American Rebel to large numbers of potential customers through the appeal of his music and other supporting appearances. For example, his appearance on the History Channel hit show Counting Cars in February 2014 has been viewed by over 2 million people. Bringing innovative products that satisfy an existing demand to the market through exciting means is the American Rebel blueprint for success.
Other
As a corporate policy, we will not incur any cash obligations that we cannot satisfy with known resources, of which there are currently none except as described in “Liquidity” below or elsewhere in this report. We believe that the perception that many people have of a public company makes it more likely that they will accept restricted securities from a public company as consideration for indebtedness to them than they would from a private company. We have not performed any studies of this matter. Our conclusion is based on our own observations. Additionally, the issuance of restricted shares will dilute the percentage of ownership interest of our stockholders.
Results of Operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021
Revenue and cost of goods sold
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we reported Sales of $986,826, compared to Sales of $1,255,703 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease is attributable to lack of inventory as the Company’s resources were diverted to completing its capital raise that closed on February 10, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we reported Cost of Sales of $812,130, compared to Cost of Sales of $952,511 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in Cost of Sales was again attributable to the reduced level of inventory. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we reported Gross Profit of $174,696, compared to Gross Profit of $303,192 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in Gross Profit was attributable to the reduced level of inventory.
Expenses
Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $3,486,135 compared to $3,075,113 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as further described below.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred consulting and business development expenses of $2,012,803, compared to consulting and business development expenses of $529,094 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in consulting and business development expenses is due to additional expenses incurred related to preparing for an equity raise.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred product development expenses of $330,353, compared to product development expenses of $320,472 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The amount of product development expenses was relatively similar.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred marketing and brand development expenses of $171,030, compared to marketing and brand development expenses of $390,294 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in marketing and brand development expenses relates primarily to the benefit of the prior year’s investment in the marketing of the American Rebel brand.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $968,306, compared to general and administrative expenses of $1,773,529 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease relates primarily to a decrease in professional, consulting and operating fees due to cost saving measures and the benefit of established systems set up in prior years.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred depreciation expense of $3,643, compared to depreciation expense of $61,724 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Other income and expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred interest expense of $2,061,782, compared to interest expense of $2,292,957 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Net Loss
Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021, amounted to $6,098,944, resulting in a loss per share of $4.85, compared to $5,981,082 for the year ended December 31, 2020, resulting in a loss per share of $7.93. The decrease in the net loss from the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2021 is primarily due to the investment in compensation that occurred in September 2020.
Liquidity
We are a development stage company and realized minimal revenue from our planned operations. We have a working capital deficit of $4,171,277 at December 31, 2021, and have incurred a deficit of $26,969,657 from inception to December 31, 2021. We have funded operations primarily through the issuance of capital stock, convertible debt and other securities.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we raised net cash of $772,505 by issuance of common and preferred shares, as compared to $- for the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we raised net cash of $2,244,100 through the issuance of promissory notes secured by specific inventory, as compared to $2,869,171 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the recoverability of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As noted above, the Company is in the development stage and, accordingly, has not yet generated significant revenues from operations. Since inception, the Company has been engaged in financing activities and executing its business plan of operations and incurring costs and expenses related to developing products and market identity, obtaining inventory and preparing for public product launch. As a result, the Company incurred net income (losses) for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 of ($6,098,944) and ($5,981,082), respectively. The Company’s accumulated deficit was ($26,969,657) as of December 31, 2021 and ($20,870,713) as of December 31, 2020. The Company’s working capital deficit was ($4,171,277) as of December 31, 2021 and a deficit of ($4,726,654) as of December 31, 2020. In addition, the Company’s development activities since inception have been sustained through equity and debt financing and the deferral of payments on accounts payable and other expenses.
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise capital from the sale of its equity and, ultimately, the achievement of operating revenues. Management believes holders of its warrants will execute their outstanding warrants generating investment capital for the Company. Management is also in discussion with several investment banks and broker dealers regarding the initiation of a capital campaign.
Management believes sufficient funding can be secured through the obtaining of loans, as well as future offerings of its preferred and Common Stock to institutional and other financial sources. However, no assurance can be given that the Company will obtain this additional working capital, or if obtained, that such funding will not cause substantial dilution its stockholders. If the Company is unable to secure such additional funds from these sources, it may be forced to change or delay its business plan rollout.
As we proceed with the launch of our American Rebel concealed carry product and safe lines we have devoted and expect to continue to devote significant resources in the areas of capital expenditures and marketing, sales, and operational expenditures.
We expect to require additional funds to further develop our business plan. Since it is impossible to predict with certainty the timing and amount of funds required to establish profitability, we anticipate that we will need to raise additional funds through equity or debt offerings or otherwise in order to meet our expected future liquidity requirements. Any such financing that we undertake will likely be dilutive to existing stockholders.
In addition, we expect to also need additional funds to respond to business opportunities and challenges, including our ongoing operating expenses, protecting our intellectual property, developing or acquiring new lines of business and enhancing our operating infrastructure. While we may need to seek additional funding for such purposes, we may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, the terms of our financings may be dilutive to, or otherwise adversely affect, holders of our Common Stock. We may also seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or other third parties. We may not be able to negotiate any such arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, we may be required to curtail or terminate some or all of our product lines.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements and related footnotes requires us to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the financial statements.
Financial Reporting Release No. 60 requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements. There are no critical policies or decisions that rely on judgments that are based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made. Note 1 to the financial statements, included elsewhere in this report, includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Recent Pronouncements
The Company evaluated recent accounting pronouncements through December 31, 2021 and believes that none have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.
