ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION
The following discussion of the plan of operation, financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements, and notes thereto, included elsewhere herein. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors including, but not limited to, those discussed in this Annual Report.
Executive Overview
GB Sciences, Inc. (“the Company”, “GB Sciences”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) is a plant-inspired, biopharmaceutical research and development company creating patented, disease-targeted formulations of cannabis- and other plant-inspired therapeutic mixtures for the prescription drug market through its wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, GbS Global Biopharma, Inc. (“GBSGB”).
Through GBSGB, the Company is engaged in the research and development of plant-inspired medicines, with virtual operations in North America and Europe. GBSGB’s assets include a portfolio of intellectual property containing both proprietary plant-inspired formulations and our AI-enabled drug discovery platform, as well as critical research contracts and key supplier arrangements. The Company’s intellectual property portfolio, which is held by GBSGB, contains six issued U.S. and three issued foreign patents, as well as 18 U.S. and 49 foreign patent-pending applications. On October 14th, 2021, we filed the nonprovisional USPTO patent application entitled “METHOD AND SYSTEMS FOR PHYTOMEDICINE ANALYTICS FOR RESEARCH OPTIMIZATION AT SCALE" to further protect aspects of our proprietary drug discovery engine, PhAROS™, which stands for Phytomedical Analytics for Research Optimization at Scale. On March 1st, 2022, the Company’s newest patent was issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for a cannabinoid-containing mixture designed to treat cardiac hypertrophy, often present in advanced heart disease. The Company’s newly issued patent also covers the use of these receptor-targeted formulations for the treatment of TRPV1-receptor associated hearing loss and urinary cystitis.
GBSGB’s intellectual property covers a range of over 65 medical conditions, from which five drug development programs are in the preclinical stage of drug development including our formulations for Parkinson’s disease ("PD"), chronic pain, COVID-related cytokine release syndrome, depression/anxiety, and cardiovascular therapeutic programs. The Company’s primary focus is on preparing its lead program for the treatment of the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease for a first-in-human clinical trial. Depending on the results of ongoing preclinical studies, the Company intends to move forward with clinical trials for its chronic pain and COVID-related cytokine release syndrome therapies after PD. The Company’s formulations for chronic pain, anxiety, and depression are currently in preclinical animal studies with researchers at the National Research Council Canada. The Company also recently received positive preclinical proof-of-concept data supporting its complex mixtures for the treatment of Cytokine Release Syndrome related to COVID-19, and its lead candidates will be optimized based on late-stage preclinical studies at Michigan State University. Proof-of-concept studies in animals that support our heart disease formulations have been successfully completed at the University of Hawaii. The Company runs a lean drug development program through GBSGB and takes effort to minimize expenses, including personnel, overhead, and fixed capital expenses through strategic partnerships with Universities and Contract Research Organizations (“CROs”). Our productive research and development network includes distinguished universities, hospitals, and Contract Research Organizations.
Recent Developments
Divestiture of Nevada Cannabis Operations
On March 24, 2020, the Company entered into the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement ("Teco MIPA") with AJE Management, LLC. Pursuant to the Teco MIPA, the Company agreed to sell 100% of its membership interests in GB Sciences Nevada, LLC, and GB Sciences Las Vegas, LLC (the "Teco Subsidiaries") for approximately $8 million, which amount includes a cash payment at closing, the extinguishment and/or repayments of certain liabilities owed to the purchaser and affiliates of the purchaser, and an 8% promissory note.
On August 10, 2020, the Company entered into the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement ("Nopah MIPA") and Promissory Note Modification Agreement with 483 Management, LLC. Pursuant to the Nopah MIPA, the Company agreed to sell its 100% membership interest in GB Sciences Nopah, LLC ("Nopah"), which holds a Nevada medical marijuana cultivation certificate. As consideration, the Company would receive $312,315 in consideration in the form of a $237,668 reduction to the outstanding principal and accrued interest balances of the 0% Note payable dated October 23, 2017, and extinguishment of accounts payable of $74,647, which were owed to an affiliate of the purchaser.
The closing of the Teco and Nopah sales was contingent upon the successful transfer of the Nevada cultivation and production licenses. On December 14, 2021, the Company received approval from the Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board for the transfer of cannabis cultivation and extraction licenses held by its subsidiaries GB Sciences Nevada, LLC, GB Sciences Las Vegas, LLC, and GB Sciences Nopah, LLC (the "Nevada Subsidiaries"). Consequently, all conditions to closing the sales of the 100% membership interests in the Nevada Subsidiaries were satisfied, and the transactions formally closed on December 31, 2021. After the closing date, the Company retains no ownership interest in the Nevada Subsidiaries.
As consideration for the membership interests, the Company received cash payments of $1,648,772 (including $400,000 in advance payments received during the nine months ended December 31, 2021), the extinguishment of debt and current liabilities owed to affiliates of the purchaser of $3,462,854, and a $3,025,000 8% note receivable.
Intellectual Property Portfolio
On March 1, 2022, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent No. 11,260,044 entitled TRPV1 ACTIVATION-MODULATING COMPLEX MIXTURES OF CANNABINOIDS AND/OR TERPENES. The patent covers intellectual property for a cannabinoid-containing mixture designed to treat cardiac hypertrophy, often present in advanced heart disease. The newly issued patent also covers the use of these receptor-targeted formulations for the treatment of TRPV1-receptor-associated hearing loss and urinary cystitis.
In October of 2021, GBSGB began its first preclinical animal trial of non-cannabis-based formulations that were discovered and pre-validated using our PhAROS™ drug discovery platform. The National Research Council of Canada (“NRC”) are testing the Company’s proprietary, psychotropic plant-based formulas for the treatment of depression and anxiety. For these novel psychotropic drug candidates, the Company used the PhAROS™ platform to identify new ingredients to improve upon an initial formulation for anxiety based on traditional medicine. The original plant mixture was derived from the kava plant, but some elements of kava are thought to cause liver toxicity. PhAROS™ identified ingredients from the Piper plant family as a substitute for the functionality of the ingredients in question without the potentially adverse safety profiles of those original ingredients. The Piper plant family includes pepper plants that are used worldwide in traditional medicines.
In late summer of 2021, the Company received positive proof-of-concept data from a human immune cell model supporting the efficacy of their proprietary MEM designed for the suppression of COVID-related, cytokine release syndromes (CRS) while preserving key anti-viral immune responses. Based on this new positive proof-of-concept data, GBSGB converted their provisional patent application entitled, “CANNABINOID-CONTAINING COMPLEX MIXTURES FOR THE TREATMENT OF CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME WHILE PRESERVING KEY ANTI-VIRAL IMMUNE REACTIONS” to a nonprovisional patent application on August 18, 2021.
On October 14th, 2020, GB Sciences filed a provisional patent application to protect its machine learning algorithm for the prediction of novel active ingredients from traditional, plant-based medical preparations. The new provisional patent application is entitled “In Silico Meta-Pharmacopeia Assembly from Non-Western Medical Systems Using Advanced Data Analytic Techniques to Identify and Design Phytotherapeutic Strategies”. GBSGB’s proprietary data analytics tool uses in silico convergence analysis to deconvolve modes of action and predict desirable components of plant-based formulations established in traditional medical practice based on computational consensus analysis across cultures and medical systems.
On September 23rd, 2020, GB Sciences received a Notice of Allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for claims protecting their Cannabinoid Containing Complex Mixtures (CCCMs) for the Treatment of Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS). The patent is owned by the Company’s Canadian entity, GBS Global Biopharma, Inc. MCAS is a severe immunological condition in which mast cells inappropriately and excessively release inflammatory mediators, resulting in a range of severe chronic hyperinflammatory symptoms and life-threatening anaphylaxis attacks. There is no single recommended treatment for MCAS patients. Instead, patients, with their doctor’s guidance, attempt to manage MCAS symptoms primarily by avoiding ‘triggers’ and using rescue medicines for their severe hyperinflammatory attacks. Therefore, MCAS patients need new therapeutic options to control their mast cell related symptoms, and the Company’s CCCM™ were designed to simultaneously control multiple inflammatory pathways within mast cells as a comprehensive treatment option. The application, entitled “Cannabinoid-Containing Complex Mixtures for the Treatment of Mast Cell-Associated or Basophil-Mediated Inflammatory Disorders” was originally filed on January 31, 2018 and describes CCCMs that can be used for the treatment of Crohn's disease, Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, allergic asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), psoriasis, eczema, urticarias, dermatitis, mastocytosis, or anaphylactic sting. Claims for these additional indications will be examined by the USPTO in the future. On December 8, 2020, the patent was issued as United States Patent 10,857,107.
On April 7th, 2020, GB Sciences received a Notice of Allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for claims protecting Cannabinoid Containing Complex Mixtures ("CCCMs") for the Treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD), which is owned by the Company’s Canadian entity, GBS Global Biopharma, Inc. On May 19, 2020, the patent was issued as United States Patent 10,653,640.
On May 12th, 2020, GB Sciences received a Notice of Allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for claims protecting Myrcene Containing Complex Mixtures ("MCCMs") for the Treatment of Neuropathic Pain. Intellectual property rights to this application and the MCCM contained within it are owned by the Company’s Canadian entity, GBS Global Biopharma, Inc. The Company's MCCMs are protected for use in the treatment of pain related to arthritis, shingles, irritable bowel syndrome, sickle cell disease, and endometriosis. The patent was issued on July 14, 2020 as United States Patent 10,709,670.
Results of Operations
The following table sets forth certain of our Statement of Operations data from continuing operations:
General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expense decreased $132,883 to $1,868,734 for the year ended March 31, 2022 as compared to $2,001,617 for the same period last year. The decrease is attributable primarily to reduced compensation paid to executives and board members. The Company is continuing its efforts to maintain administrative costs at a minimum and to make the best use of its limited resources in advancing research & development of the Company's intellectual property portfolio.
Gain on extinguishment. The Company recorded a gain on extinguishment of $22,405 In connection with the Second Promissory Note Modification agreement with 483 Management, LLC. The gain on extinguishment of $467,872 for the year ended March 31, 2021 relates to the Judgment Settlement Agreement with Iliad Research & Trading, L.P. In order to settle the lawsuit brought by Iliad, the Company paid $3,006,014 in full satisfaction of the principal and accrued interest balance of $3,473,886.
Gain on settlement of accounts payable. During the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company settled accounts payable at a discount in exchange for immediate lump sum payments and recorded income from cancellation of accounts payable totaling $422,414.
Gain on deconsolidation. The Company recorded a gain on deconsolidation of $5,206,208 related to the sale of its membership interests in the Nevada Subsidiaries during the year ended March 31, 2022.
Interest Expense. Interest for the year ended March 31, 2022 was $474,768, compared to $1,285,460 for the year ended March 31, 2021. The decrease is attributable to substantially less interest-bearing debt outstanding during the year ended March 31, 2022, as the result of the payoff of the note payable to Iliad Research and Trading, L.P. in December 2020. In addition, notes with balances totaling $2.1 million at December 31, 2021 stopped accruing interest beginning December 1, 2020, as the result of the Omnibus Amendment to the agreements surrounding the sale of the Company's Nevada Subsidiaries.
Loss on modification of line of credit. As a result of the Omnibus Amendment dated December 29, 2020, the Company accrued a modification expense of $650,000. The amount represents an increase to the note balance to a total of $1,025,000, which will reduce the note receivable issued to the Company at the closing of the sale of the Teco Facility.
Loss on impairment of note receivable. During the year ended March 31, 2022, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $3,025,000 related to the $3,025,000 note receivable from AJE Management LLC received from the sale of the Nevada Subsidiaries. The impairment charge was deemed necessary due to the note maker's failure to pay the interest payment due on April 1, 2022 and anticipated failure to make the payment due July 1, 2022, under a contractual provision that allows the deferral of payments to the next quarterly payment date in the event that cash flow from the Teco Facility is insufficient to make that quarter's payment.
Debt default penalty. The Company recorded a default penalty of $286,059 for the year ended March 31, 2021 related to the Company's failure to timely repay the principal and interest owed under the note payable to Iliad Research and Trading, L.P. on April 1, 2020. The penalty is 10% of the principal and accrued interest balances outstanding at the time of default.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Current Liquidity
The Company will need additional capital to implement our strategies. There is no assurance that it will be able to raise the amount of capital needed for future growth plans. Even if financing is available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable. If unable to raise the necessary capital at the times required, the Company may have to materially change the business plan, including delaying implementation of aspects of the business plan or curtailing or abandoning the business plan. The Company represents a speculative investment and investors may lose all of their investment. In order to be able to achieve the strategic goals, the Company needs to further expand its business and financing activities. Based upon the cash position, it is necessary to raise additional capital by the end of the next quarter in order to continue to fund current operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern. The Company is pursuing several alternatives to address this situation, including the raising of additional funding through equity or debt financings. In order to finance existing operations and pay current liabilities over the next twelve months, the Company will need to raise additional capital. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to operate profitably on a consistent basis, or at all, in the future.
The principal sources of liquidity to date have been cash generated from sales of debt and equity securities.
At March 31, 2022, the Company had a cash balance of $233,893, other current assets excluding cash were $93,933, and our working capital deficit was $3,607,638. Current liabilities were $3,935,464, which consisted principally of $987,565 in notes and convertible notes payable, $1,657,008 in accounts payable, $394,396 in accrued liabilities, and $896,495 income taxes payable from discontinued operations. At March 31, 2021, the Company had a cash balance of $793,040, other current assets excluding cash were $256,251, current assets from discontinued operations were $2,494,564, and our working capital deficit was $5,054,593, net of working capital of $1,201,488 from discontinued operations. Current liabilities were $8,598,448, which consisted principally of $3,594,804 in notes and convertible notes payable, $1,412,459 in accounts payable, $1,451,687 in accrued liabilities, $84,913 of indebtedness to related parties, $761,509 of income taxes from discontinued operations, and $1,293,076 current liabilities from discontinued operations.
Sources and Uses of Cash
Operating Activities
Cash used in operations was $1,866,154 including $87,772 used in discontinued operations for the year ended March 31, 2022, compared to cash used of $2,185,220 including $118,644 used in discontinued operations for the year ended March 31, 2021. We anticipate that cash flows from operations will be insufficient to fund business operations for the next twelve-month period. Accordingly, we will have to generate additional liquidity or cash flow to fund our current and anticipated operations. This will likely require the sale of additional common stock or other securities. There is no assurance that we will be able to realize any significant proceeds from such sales, if at all.
Investing Activities
Cash flows provided by investing activities were $1,450,339, including $1,567 provided by discontinued operations for the year ended March 31, 2022, compared to cash provided by investing activities of $4,655,519, net of $103,729 used in discontinued operations for the year ended March 31, 2021. Cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations for the year ended March 31, 2022 consists of $1,648,772 proceeds from the sale of the Nevada Subsidiaries, offset by $200,000 paid to our attorneys to file patent applications. Cash provided by investing activities for the prior year relates to $5,051,923 proceeds received from the Wellcana note receivable, offset by $292,675 used to pay our attorneys and researchers to draft and file patent applications. Cash used in prior year investing activities was used to pay our attorneys and researchers to draft and file patent applications.
Financing Activities
During the year ended March 31, 2022 cash used in financing activities was $495,925 including $103,387 used in discontinued operations. For the year ended March 31, 2021, cash used in financing activities was $1,476,432, including $161,768 used in discontinued operations.
Cash used in financing activities of continuing operations for the year ended March 31, 2022 consisted of $575,000 used for principal payments on notes payable and $6,266 paid for brokerage fees from warrant exercises, offset by $138,728 proceeds from warrant exercises and $50,000 proceeds from a convertible note payable.
Cash used in financing activities of continuing operations for the year ended March 31, 2021 consisted of $3,156,014 used for principal payments of the note payable to Iliad Research and Trading, L.P., principal repayment of a related party note in the amount of $151,923, brokerage fees of $107,373 for warrant solicitations, and debt issuance fees of $74,750, offset by $1,075,396 proceeds from warrant exercises, $725,000 in proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes, and $375,000 in proceeds from a line of credit.
Notes and Convertible Notes Payable
0% Note Payable dated October 23, 2017
On October 23, 2017, the Company amended the existing Nevada Medical Marijuana Production License Agreement (“Amended Production License Agreement”). Per the terms of the Amended Production License Agreement, GB Sciences purchased the remaining percentage of the production license resulting in the 100% ownership of the license. GB Sciences also received 100% ownership of the cultivation license included in the original Nevada Medical Marijuana Production License Agreement. In exchange, GB Sciences made one-time payment of $500,000 and issued a 0% Promissory Note in the amount of $700,000 payable in equal monthly payments over a three-year period commencing on January 1, 2018. The present value of the note was $521,067 on the date of its issuance based on an imputed interest rate of 20.3% and the Company recorded a discount on notes payable of $178,933 related to the difference between the face value and present value of the note.
On August 10, 2020, the Company entered into the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement ("Nopah MIPA") for the sale of its interest in GB Sciences Nopah, LLC. The Nopah sale was closed December 31, 2021 after successful transfer of the Nevada Medical Marijuana Cultivation Facility Registration Certificate on December 14, 2021. At close, the principal balance of the note was reduced from $369,445 to $190,272 and accounts payable totaling $74,647 to an affiliate of the purchaser were extinguished.
On March 4, 2022, the Company entered into the Second Promissory Note Modification Agreement, which reduced the total outstanding balance of principal and interest from $201,532 (at the time of the agreement) to $179,127 and modified the terms of the note to provide that the Company would make an immediate payment of $75,000, with $5,000 monthly payments thereafter until the note is repaid in full. The modification also provided that the note would bear interest at 8.0% per annum.
We evaluated the modification under the guidance in ASC 470-50 and determined that the modification represents an extinguishment because the change in the fair value of the note exceeded 10% of the carrying value of the note immediately prior to the modification. As a result, the Company recorded a gain on extinguishment of $22,405 equal to the change in the carrying value of the note resulting from the modification.
The Company made a $75,000 payment pursuant to the terms of the modification on March 4, 2022. At March 31, 2022, the outstanding balance of the note was $104,127 and accrued interest was $616.
8% Line of Credit dated July 24, 2020
On July 24, 2020, the Company entered into the Loan Agreement, 8% Secured Promissory Note, and Security Agreement (together, the "July 24 Note") with AJE Management, LLC, which established a revolving loan of up to $500,000 that the Company may draw on from time to time. The loan was collateralized by the Teco Facility, subject to the pre-existing lien held by CSW Ventures, L.P. in connection with the 8% Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note dated February 28, 2019. Contemporaneously with the Loan Agreement, the Company and AJE Management entered into the Amendment to the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with AJE Management. The amendment provides that any balances outstanding under the July 24 Note at the time of the close of the sale of the Teco Facility would be forgiven in exchange for a reduction to the $4,000,000 note receivable that the Company will receive as consideration for the sale of the Teco Facility. The reduction to the note receivable would be equal to 3 times the balance outstanding under the July 24 Note on the date of the close of the sale of the Teco Facility. The balance outstanding under the note plus accrued interest were permitted to be repaid at any time prior to the close of the sale of the Teco facility.
On December 29, 2020, the Company entered into the Omnibus Amendment with the purchaser of the Teco Facility. The Omnibus Amendment reduced the amount of the note receivable that the Company was to receive from the sale of the Teco Facility by $975,000 (three times $325,000 in advances made under the July 24 Note) to $3,025,000. Any advances made to the Company under the July 24 Note in excess of $325,000 were to reduce the amount of cash received upon close of the sale of Teco one-for-one, i.e., such advances would be considered advance payments of the $4,000,000 cash purchase price. No interest would accrue after November 30, 2020. The Company also agreed that it would not repay the balances outstanding under the July 24 Note prior to the closing of the Teco sale. As a result of the Omnibus Amendment, the Company accrued a modification expense of $650,000 during the year ended March 31, 2021. Prior to December 31, 2021, the Company received $50,000 in additional advances above $325,000 during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, bringing the total balance to $1,025,000, and accrued interest was $12,510. Upon close of the Teco sale on December 31, 2021, the note and accrued interest balances were forgiven and the Company has no further obligations related to the line of credit.
March 2017 and July 2017 Convertible Note Offerings
In March 2017, the Company entered into a Placement Agent’s Agreement with a third-party brokerage firm to offer units consisting of a $1,000 6% promissory note convertible into 4,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at $0.25 per share and 4,000 warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s’ common stock at an exercise price of $0.60 per share for the period of three years. Between March 2017 and May 2017, the Company issued short-term Promissory Notes (“Notes”) to various holders with combined face value of $2,000,000. The Notes are payable within three years of issuance and are convertible into 8,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company also issued 8,000,000 common stock warrants to the Noteholders. The warrants are exercisable at any time and from time to time before maturity at the option of the holder. Each warrant gives the Noteholder the right to purchase one share of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $0.60 per share for a period of three years. The Company recorded an aggregate discount on convertible notes of $1,933,693, which included $904,690 related to the relative fair value of beneficial conversion features and $1,029,003 for the relative fair value of the warrants issued with each note. The fair value of warrants was derived using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
In July 2017, the Company entered into a Placement Agent’s Agreement with a third-party brokerage firm to offer units consisting of a $1,000 6% promissory note convertible into 4,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at $0.25 per share and 4,000 warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s’ common stock at an exercise price of $0.65 per share for the period of three years. Between July 2017 and December 2017, the Company issued short-term Promissory Notes (“Notes”) to various holders with combined face value of $7,201,000. The Notes are payable within three years of issuance and are convertible into 28,804,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company also issued 28,804,000 common stock warrants to the Note holders. The warrants are exercisable at any time and from time to time before maturity at the option of the holder. Each warrant gives the Noteholder the right to purchase one share of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $0.60 per share for a period of three years. The Company recorded an aggregate discount on convertible notes of $7,092,796, which included $3,142,605 related to the relative fair value of beneficial conversion features and $3,950,191 for the relative fair value of the warrants issued with each note. The fair value of warrants was derived using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
All notes from the March and July 2017 offerings have passed their maturity dates. During the year ended March 31, 2022, the Company agreed to extensions with the holders of a total of $197,000 of the $1,257,000 that remains outstanding. For the $197,000 of extended notes, the Company agreed to reduce the conversion price to $0.10 per share and issued a total of 788,000 additional warrants to the holders of the notes with a term of three years and an exercise price of $0.10 per share. In exchange, the maturity date of the notes was extended to September 30, 2023. Using the Black-Scholes model, the Company valued the warrants at $13,396 and the change in the fair value of the conversion feature at $33,490. Because the change in the fair value of the conversion feature exceeded 10% of the carrying amount of the notes, the Company accounted for the modification of the notes as an extinguishment and recorded a discount on the new convertible notes of $46,886 related to the fair value of the new warrants issued and the change in the fair value of the conversion feature. The Company recorded interest expense of $26,127 on the new notes during the year ended March 31, 2022, of which $14,306 represented amortization of the note discounts. Accrued interest on the $197,000 extended notes is $56,152 at March 31, 2022, which includes $38,438 accrued prior to the extinguishments.
Three convertible notes totaling $1,060,000 held by the same investor are past maturity and are currently in default. On January 20, 2022, the Company repaid $500,000 of the principal balances owed to the investor, and one convertible note in the amount of $560,000 remains outstanding plus accrued interest on all three notes totaling $286,119. The Company intends to negotiate the terms of an extension of the remaining note and accrued interest with the note holder. The notes do not provide for a default penalty or penalty interest rate. Interest expense for the notes was $57,846 during the year ended March 31, 2022.
8% Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note dated February 28, 2019
On February 28, 2019, the Company issued a $1,500,000 8% Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note and entered into the Note Purchase Agreement and Security Agreement with CSW Ventures, L.P. (together, “CSW Note”). The note matured on August 28, 2020, and was convertible at any time until maturity into 8,823,529 shares of the Company’s common stock at $0.17 per share. Collateral pledged as security for the note includes all of the Company’s 100% membership interests in GB Sciences, Nevada, LLC and GB Sciences Las Vegas, LLC, which together represent substantially all of the Company’s cannabis cultivation and production operations and assets located at the Teco facility in Las Vegas, Nevada.
On December 29, 2020, the Company entered into the Omnibus Amendment, and the note holder agreed to cease interest accrual on the CSW Note after November 30, 2020. After conversions, the remaining principal balance and carrying amount of the note was $1,111,863 as of December 31, 2021. Accrued interest was $144,994.
Upon close of the Teco sale on December 31, 2021, the note and accrued interest balances were extinguished in exchange for a reduction of 110% of the balances of accrued interest and principal outstanding to the $4 million cash payment. The 10% increase to the balances owed under the note totaled $125,686, and the Company recorded that amount as a reduction of the gain on deconsolidation.
8% Convertible Promissory Note dated April 23, 2019
On April 23, 2019, the Company entered into the Note Purchase Agreement with Iliad Research and Trading, L.P. ("Iliad") and issued an 8% Convertible Promissory Note with a face value of $2,765,000. The Note was issued with original issue discount of $265,000 and is convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $0.17 per share at the option of the note holder at any time until the Note is repaid. The Note matured on April 22, 2020. A total discount of $440,000 was recorded on the note, which includes $265,000 of original issue discount and $175,000 in fees paid to brokers.
During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company honored the conversion of a total of a total of $125,000 of accrued interest on the Iliad Note at reduced conversion rates. On October 30, 2019, the Company received notice of the conversion of $75,000 at $0.06 per share and issued 1,250,000 shares of its common stock. The fair value of the shares issued exceeded the fair value of the shares issuable under the original terms of the Note by $64,706, and the Company recorded an induced conversion expense. On November 18, 2019, the Company received notice of the conversion of $50,000 of the note balance at $0.0375 per share and issued 1,333,333 shares of its common stock.
On April 22, 2020, the Company failed to make payment of the principal and accrued interest due under the Iliad Note, resulting in a default. Upon the occurrence of the default, the principal and accrued interest balances outstanding increased by 10%. As the result of the default, Company recorded an expense of $9,559 related to a 10% increase in the accrued interest balance and $276,500 related to the 10% increase in the principal balance, totaling $286,059 which is recorded as debt default penalty on the statement of operations for the year ended March 31, 2021.
On May 20, 2020, Iliad filed a lawsuit against the Company in the Third Judicial District Court of Salt Lake County in the State of Utah demanding repayment of the note. The lawsuit further sought to compel the Company to participate in arbitration pursuant to the arbitration provisions contained within the Note Purchase Agreement and to prohibit the Company to raise funds through the issuance of its common stock unless the note is paid in full simultaneously with such issuance. On July 14, 2020, the Court entered judgment in favor of Iliad in the amount of $3,264,594 plus reasonable attorney's fees and costs and accrued post-judgment interest at the default rate of 15% per annum.
On November 20, 2020, the Company, Iliad, and Wellcana Plus, LLC entered into the Judgment Settlement Agreement, whereby Iliad agreed to discharge all amounts owed to it by the Company upon receipt of payment totaling $3,006,015 directly from the proceeds of the Wellcana Note Receivable on or before December 8, 2020. On December 8, 2020, Wellcana failed to make payment to the Company. On December 9, 2020, the Company entered into a letter agreement with Iliad extending the Judgment Settlement agreement in exchange for payment of $25,000 plus $25,000 per week until the payment totaling $3,006,015 is received by Iliad, with such payments not reducing the amount owed under the Judgment Settlement Agreement. On December 16, 2020, Wellcana made payment of the full amount owed to the Company, of which $3,006,015 was paid directly to Iliad in full satisfaction of the Judgment Settlement Agreement. On December 18, 2020, Iliad filed a Satisfaction of Judgment in the Third Judicial District Court of Salt Lake County in the State of Utah, and the lawsuit was dismissed. The Company has no further obligations to Iliad.
December 2020 $625,000 6% Convertible Notes
On December 18, 2020, the Company began an offering of 6.0% convertible notes for the purpose of funding a pre-clinical study of the Company's patent-pending Cannabinoid-Containing Complex Mixtures for the treatment of Cytokine Release Syndromes, including Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, in COVID-19 patients. The Company pledged the related intellectual property as security for the notes. The notes are convertible at a rate of $0.05 per share at the lender's request.

Variables and Trends
We have limited operating history with respect to the current business plan. In the event we are able to obtain the necessary financing to move forward with the business plan, we expect business expenses to increase significantly as we go operational. Accordingly, the comparison of the financial data for the periods presented may not be a meaningful indicator of future performance and must be considered in light these circumstances.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
Critical Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to allowances for doubtful accounts, collectibility of notes receivable, inventory valuation and standard cost allocations, valuation of initial right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities, valuation of beneficial conversion features in convertible debt, valuation of the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations, stock-based compensation expense, purchased intangible asset valuations, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, litigation, other loss contingencies, and impairment of long lived assets. These estimates and assumptions are based on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results the Company experiences may differ materially and adversely from these estimates.
Discontinued Operations
Discontinued operations comprise those activities that were disposed of during the period or which were classified as held for sale at the end of the period and represent a separate major line of business or geographical area that can be clearly distinguished for operational and financial reporting purposes. The Company has included its former subsidiaries GB Sciences Nevada, LLC, GB Sciences Las Vegas, LLC, and GB Sciences Nopah, LLC in discontinued operations due to the sale of the Company's Nevada Subsidiaries.
Inventory
We value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost of our inventory, as determined using the first-in, first-out method, or its current estimated market value. We periodically review our physical inventory for excess, obsolete, and potentially impaired items and reserve accordingly. Our reserve estimate for excess and obsolete inventory is based on expected future use. Indirect costs, which primarily relate to the lease and operation costs of the Teco Facility, are allocated based on square footage of the facility used in the production of inventory.
Indefinite and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets
Our indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily represent the value of our patents pending and includes the costs paid to draft and file patent applications. Upon issuance of the patents, the indefinite-lived intangible assets will have finite lives. Intangible assets also included the acquisition cost of a cannabis production license with an indefinite life (in prior periods).
We amortize our finite-lived intangible assets, which consist of granted patents, over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method, and we periodically evaluate the remaining useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization.
We review all of our intangible assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. Impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets is performed at least annually and we perform testing for definite-lived intangible assets whenever impairment indicators are present. If we determine that the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets during testing, we record impairment losses equal to the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the fair market value of the asset.
Long-Lived Assets
Property and equipment comprised a significant portion of our total assets from discontinued operations as of March 31, 2021. We evaluate the carrying value of property and equipment if impairment indicators are present or if other circumstances indicate that impairment may exist under authoritative guidance. The annual testing date is March 31. When management believes impairment indicators may exist, projections of the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the use of and eventual disposition of property and equipment are prepared. If the projections indicate that the carrying value of the property and equipment are not recoverable, we reduce the carrying values to fair value. These impairment tests are heavily influenced by assumptions and estimates that are subject to change as additional information becomes available.
Beneficial Conversion Feature of Convertible Notes Payable
The Company accounts for convertible notes payable in accordance with the guidelines established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options and Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) 00-27, “Application of Issue No. 98-5 to Certain Convertible Instruments”. A beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”) exists on the date a convertible note is issued when the fair value of the underlying common stock to which the note is convertible into is in excess of the remaining unallocated proceeds of the note after first considering the allocation of a portion of the note proceeds to the fair value of any attached equity instruments, if any related equity instruments were granted with the debt. In accordance with this guidance, the BCF of a convertible note is measured by allocating a portion of the note's proceeds to the warrants, if applicable, and as a reduction of the carrying amount of the convertible note equal to the intrinsic value of the conversion feature, both of which are credited to additional paid-in-capital. The Company calculates the fair value of warrants issued with the convertible notes using the Black-Scholes valuation model and uses the same assumptions for valuing any employee options in accordance with ASC Topic 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation. The only difference is that the contractual life of the warrants is used.
The value of the proceeds received from a convertible note is then allocated between the conversion features and warrants on a relative fair value basis. The allocated fair value is recorded in the financial statements as a debt discount (premium) from the face amount of the note and such discount is amortized over the expected term of the convertible note (or to the conversion date of the note, if sooner) and is charged to interest expense.
Equity-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to employees in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718 Stock Compensation (ASC 718) and Equity-Based Payments to Non-employees pursuant to ASC 505-50 (ASC 505-50). The computation of the expense associated with stock-based compensation requires the use of a valuation model. The FASB-issued accounting guidance requires significant judgment and the use of estimates, particularly surrounding Black-Scholes assumptions such as stock price volatility, expected option lives, and expected option forfeiture rates, to value equity-based compensation. We currently use a Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of our stock options. We primarily use historical data to determine the assumptions to be used in the Black-Scholes model and have no reason to believe that future data is likely to differ materially from historical data. However, changes in the assumptions to reflect future stock price volatility and future stock award exercise experience could result in a change in the assumptions used to value awards in the future and may result in a material change to the fair value calculation of stock-based awards. This accounting guidance requires the recognition of the fair value of stock compensation in net income. Although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our estimates and assumptions, significant unanticipated changes in those estimates, interpretations and assumptions may result in recording stock option expense that may materially impact our financial statements for each respective reporting period.
Income Taxes
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax items are reflected at the enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Due to the uncertainty regarding the success of future operations, management has valued the deferred tax asset allowance at 100% of the related deferred tax assets.
Because the Company operated in the State-licensed cannabis industry until the December 31, 2021 disposition of the Nevada Subsidiaries, revenue from those activities were subject to the limitations of Internal Revenue Code Section 280E (“280E”) for U.S. income tax purposes. Under 280E, the Company is allowed to deduct expenses that are directly related to the production of its products, i.e. cost of goods sold, but is allowed no further deductions for ordinary and necessary business expenses from its gross profit. The Company believes that the deductions disallowed include the deduction of net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs"). The unused NOLs will continue to carry forward and those that do not expire or become subject to other limitations may be used by the Company to offset future taxable income that is not subject to the limitations of 280E.
