Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.
Company Background
MJ Holdings, Inc. (OTCPK: MJNE) is a highly-diversified holding company providing cultivation management, asset and infrastructure development - currently concentrated in the Las Vegas market. It is the Company’s intention to grow its business and provide a 360-degree spectrum of infrastructure, including, cannabis cultivation, production of cannabis related products, management services, dispensaries and consulting services. The Company intends to grow its business through joint ventures with existing companies possessing complementary subject matter expertise, acquisition of existing companies and through the development of new opportunities. The Company intends to “prove the concept” profitably in the rapidly expanding Las Vegas market and then use that anticipated success as a template for replicating the concept in other developing states through a combination of strategic partnerships, acquisitions and opening new operations.
The Company was incorporated on November 17, 2006, as Securitas EDGAR Filings, Inc. under the laws of the State of Nevada. Prior to the formation of Securitas EDGAR Filings Inc., the business was operated as Xpedient EDGAR Filings, LLC, a Florida Limited Liability Company, formed on October 31, 2005. On November 21, 2005, Xpedient EDGAR Filings LLC amended its Articles of Organization to change its name to Securitas EDGAR Filings, LLC. On January 21, 2009, Securitas EDGAR Filings LLC merged into Securitas EDGAR Filings, Inc., a Nevada corporation. On February 14, 2014, the Company amended and restated its Articles of Incorporation and changed its name to MJ Holdings, Inc.
On November 22, 2016, in connection with a plan to divest the Company of its real estate business, the Company submitted to its stockholders an offer to exchange (the “Exchange Offer”) its common stock for shares in MJ Real Estate Partners, LLC, (“MJRE”) a newly-formed LLC formed for the sole purpose of effecting the Exchange Offer. On January 10, 2017, the Company accepted for exchange 1,800,000 shares of its Common Stock in exchange for 1,800,000 shares of MJRE’s common units, representing membership interests in MJRE. Effective February 1, 2017, the Company transferred its ownership interests in the real estate properties and its subsidiaries, through which the Company held ownership of the real estate properties, to MJRE. MJRE also assumed the senior notes and any and all obligations associated with the real estate properties and business, effective February 1, 2017.
Operational highlights:
● a three-acre, hybrid, outdoor, marijuana-cultivation facility (the “Cultivation Facility”) located in the Amargosa Valley of Nevada. The Company had the contractual right to manage and cultivate marijuana on this property until 2026, for which it would have received sixty percent (60%) of the net revenues realized from its management of this facility and twenty-five percent (25%) of the net revenues from equipment rental. The licensed facility is owned by Acres Cultivation, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Curaleaf Holdings, Inc. On January 21, 2021, the Company received a Notice of Termination, effective immediately, from Acres Cultivation, LLC. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company relocated all of its equipment utilized on the Acres lease to its 260 Acres adjacent to the Acres lease. The Company will not generate any further revenue under the Acres relationship.
● 260 acres of farmland for the purpose of cultivating additional marijuana (the “260 Acres”) purchased in January of 2019. The Company intends to utilize the state-of-the-art Cravo® cultivation system for growing an additional five acres of marijuana on this property. The Cravo® system will allow multiple harvests per year and should result in higher annual yields per acre. The land has more than 180-acre feet of permitted water rights, which will provide more than sufficient water to markedly increase the Company’s marijuana cultivation capabilities. This facility, upon receipt of its business license in Nye County and its final inspection by the Cannabis Compliance Board (“CCB”), is expected to become operational in the summer of 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company elected to relocate all of its equipment utilized on the Acres lease to its 260 Acres adjacent to the Acres lease. The Company will utilize the 260 Acres for its own harvest along with additional harvests under any Cultivation and Sales Agreements.
● Cultivation and Sales Agreements entered into for multiple grows on the Company’s 260 Acres located in the Amargosa Valley of Nevada. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company entered into separate Cultivation and Sales Agreements, whereby the Company shall retain certain independent growers to provide oversight and management of the Company’s cultivation and sale of products at its 260 Acres. The independent growers shall pay to the Company a royalty of net sales revenue with a minimum royalty after two years. As of the date of this filing, the Company is waiting on its business license in Nye County and its final inspection by the Cannabis Compliance Board before it can commence its operations under the Agreement.
● a nearby commercial trailer and RV park (THC Park - Tiny Home Community) was purchased in April of 2019 to supply necessary housing for the Company’s farm employees. After the Company’s 2018 harvest, it came to realize that it would need to find a more efficient method of housing and to bring its cultivation team to its facilities. The Company purchased the 50-acre plus THC Park for $600,000 in cash and $50,000 of the Company’s restricted common stock. At present, the Company’s construction and completion of this community is approximately seventy-five present complete. The impact of COVID-19 in obtaining inspections and permitting has significantly delayed the completion of this community. The Company has elected to cease any renovations or additions at its Tiny Home Community until it plants its first grow on the 260 Acres and can better evaluate the need for additional housing.
● an agreement to acquire a cultivation license and production license, both currently located in Nye County Nevada. On February 5, 2021, the Company (the “Purchaser”) executed a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (“MIPA3”) with MJ Distributing, Inc. (the “Seller”) to acquire all of the outstanding membership interests of MJ Distributing C202, LLC and MJ Distributing P133, LLC, each the holder of a State of Nevada provisional medical and recreational cultivation license and a provisional medical and recreational production license. In consideration of the sale, transfer, assignment and delivery of the Membership Interests to Purchaser, and the covenants made by Seller under the MIPA3, Purchaser agrees to pay a combination of cash, promissory notes, and stock in the amount of One-Million-Two-Hundred-Fifty Thousand Dollars ($1,250,000.00) in cash and/or promissory notes and 200,000 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock, all of which constitutes the consideration agreed to herein for (the “Purchase Price”), payable as follows: (i) a non-refundable down payment in the amount of $300,000 was made on January 15, 2021, (ii) the second payment in the amount of $200,000 was made on February 5, 2021, (iii) a deposit in the amount of $310,000 was paid on February 22, 2021 ($210,000 was a pre-payment against future compensation due under the MIPA3), (iv) $200,000 was deposited on June 24, 2021, (v) $200,000 shall be deposited on or before June 12, 2021, and (vi) $250,000 shall be deposited within five (5) business days after the Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board (“CCB”) provides notice on its agenda that the Licenses are set for hearing to approve the transfer of ownership from the Seller to the Purchaser.
● indoor cultivation facility build-out in the City of Las Vegas (the “Indoor Facility”). Through its former subsidiary, Red Earth, LLC (“Red Earth”), the Company held a Medical Marijuana Establishment Registration Certificate, Application No. C012. In August of 2019, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Element NV, LLC (“Element”), to sell a 49% interest in the license. Under the terms of the Agreement, Element was required to invest more than $3,500,000 into this Indoor Facility. Element paid the monthly rent on the facility from December 2019 through March 2020 but failed to make any additional payments. On June 11, 2020, the Company entered into the First Amendment (“First Amendment”) to the Agreement. Under the terms of the First Amendment, the Closing Purchase Price was adjusted to $441,000, and Element was required to make a capital contribution (the “Initial Contribution Payment”) to the Target Company in the amount of $120,000 and was required to make an additional cash contribution (the Final Contribution Payment”) in the amount of $240,000. The Company terminated its discussions with Element regarding its past due payments. On or about May 7, 2021, Red Earth, received an inquiry from the State of Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board (“CCB”) regarding the transfer of ownership of the Subsidiary from its previous owners to the Company. The CCB has determined that the transfer was not formally approved, thus a Category II violation. On July 27, 2021, Red Earth entered into a Stipulation and Order for Settlement of Disciplinary Action (the “Stipulation Order”) with the CCB. Under the terms of the Stipulation Order, Red Earth agreed to present to the CCB, by not later than August 31, 2021, a plan pursuant to which the ownership of Red Earth will be returned to the original owners. The Parties to the Stipulation Order resolved the matter without the necessity of taking formal action. Red Earth agreed to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which was paid on July 29, 2021. On August 26, 2021, the Company and the Company’s Chief Cultivation Officer and previous owner of Red Earth, Paris Balaouras, entered into a Termination Agreement. Under the terms of the Termination Agreement, the Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), dated December 15, 2017, entered into between the Company and Red Earth was terminated as of the date of the Termination Agreement resulting in the return of ownership of Red Earth to Mr. Balaouras. Neither party shall have any further obligation to one another pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement.
The Company may also continue to seek to identify potential acquisitions of revenue producing assets and licenses within legalized cannabis markets that can maximize shareholder value.
The Company may face substantial competition in the operation of cultivation facilities in Nevada. Numerous other companies have also been granted cultivation licenses, and, therefore, the Company anticipates that it will face competition from these other companies. The Company’s management team has experience in successfully developing, implementing, and operating marijuana cultivation and related businesses in other legal cannabis markets. The Company believes its experience in outdoor cultivation provides it with a distinct competitive advantage over its competitors and it will continue to focus on this area of its operations.
Acquisition of Red Earth
On December 15, 2017, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Red Earth, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“Red Earth”) established in October 2016, in exchange for 52,732,969 shares of its Common Stock and a promissory note in the amount of $900,000. The acquisition was accounted for as a “Reverse Merger”, whereby Red Earth was considered the accounting acquirer and became its wholly owned subsidiary. Upon the consummation of the acquisition, the now former members of Red Earth became the beneficial owners of approximately 88% of the Company’s Common Stock, obtained controlling interest of the Company, and retained certain of its key management positions. In accordance with the accounting treatment for a “reverse merger” or a “reverse acquisition”, the Company’s historical financial statements prior to the reverse merger will be replaced with the historical financial statements of Red Earth prior to the reverse merger in all future filings with the SEC. Red Earth is the holder of a Nevada Marijuana Establishment Certificate for the cultivation of marijuana.
On or about May 7, 2021, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Red Earth, LLC (the “Subsidiary”), received an inquiry from the State of Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board (“CCB”) regarding the transfer of ownership of the Subsidiary from its previous owners to the Company. The CCB has determined that the transfer was not formally approved, thus a Category II violation.
The consolidated financial statements after completion of the reverse merger included: the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the combined company from and after the closing date of the reverse merger, with only certain aspects of pre-consummation stockholders’ equity remaining in the consolidated financial statements. In February of 2019, the Company repurchased, from the Company’s largest shareholder, 20,000,000 of the 26,366,484 shares of common stock that this shareholder originally received in connection with the Reverse Merger - for a total purchase price of $20,000.
On July 27, 2021, the Subsidiary entered into a Stipulation and Order for Settlement of Disciplinary Action (the “Stipulation Order”) with the CCB. Under the terms of the Stipulation Order, the Subsidiary has agreed to present to the CCB, by not later than August 31, 2021, a plan pursuant to which the ownership of the Subsidiary will be returned to the original owners. The Parties to the Stipulation Order resolved the matter without the necessity of taking formal action. The Subsidiary agreed to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which was paid on July 29, 2021.
On August 1, 2021, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding and Agreement for Technical Services and Short-Term Funding (the “Agreement”) with Red Earth, LLC (hereinafter, “Red Earth”), an entity controlled by its Chief Cultivation Officer, Paris Balaouras. Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company will provide a short-term loan (the “Loan”) to Red Earth for expenses related to the activation and operation of Red Earth’s cultivation license. The Loan shall bear interest at 12% per annum and increase to 18% upon default. In addition, the Company shall provide Red Earth pre-opening technical services at a cost of $5,000 to $7,500 per month. As of December 31, 2021, the amount due the Company under the short-term loan is $40,165.
On August 26, 2021, the Company and the Company’s Chief Cultivation Officer and previous owner of Red Earth, Paris Balaouras, entered into a Termination Agreement. Under the terms of the Termination Agreement, the Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), dated December 15, 2017, entered into between the Company and Red Earth was terminated as of the date of the Termination Agreement resulting in the return of ownership of Red Earth to Mr. Balaouras. Neither party shall have any further obligation to one another pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. On September 2, 2021, the Company received approval of the Termination Agreement from the CCB. Please see Note 7 - Intangible Assets and Note 15 - Gain on Disposal of Subsidiary for further information.
Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates
The Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. The Company believes that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers using the modified retrospective method. Since the Company had not previously recognized any revenue there was no impact upon adoption of ASC 606 on its consolidated financial statements. The new revenue standard was applied prospectively in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from January 1, 2018 forward and reported financial information for historical comparable periods will not be revised and will continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect during those historical periods. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or performance obligations for services is transferred to the Company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the goods or services.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance on deferred tax assets is established when management considers it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Tax benefits from an uncertain tax position are only recognized if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as incurred as a component of income tax expense. The Company has not recognized any tax benefits from uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods presented.
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The Company’s historical financial statements prior to the reverse merger were replaced with the historical financial statements of Red Earth, the “accounting acquirer,” based on the accounting treatment for reverse merger transactions.

(ii) In April 2018, the Company entered into a management agreement with Acres Cultivation, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (the “Licensed Operator”) that holds a license for the legal cultivation of marijuana for sale under the laws of the State of Nevada. In January of 2019, the Company entered into a revised agreement, which replaced the April 2018 agreement, with the Licensed Operator in order to be more stringently aligned with Nevada marijuana laws. The material terms of the agreement remain unchanged. The Licensed Operator is contractually obligated to pay over to the Company eighty-five (85%) percent of gross revenues defined as gross proceeds from sales of marijuana products minus applicable state excise taxes and local sales tax. The agreement is to remain in force until April 2026. In April 2019, the Licensed Operator was acquired by Curaleaf Holdings, Inc., a publicly traded Canadian cannabis company. On January 21, 2021, the Company received a Notice of Termination, effective immediately, from Acres Cultivation, LLC. The Company does not anticipate that it will generate any further revenue under the Acres relationship.
(iii) Product sales from Company inventory. As part of the termination of the Acres Cultivation, LLC Cultivation and Sales Agreement, the Company was given cannabis available for resale.
