Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the section entitled “Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company built around a team of seasoned industry experts with a shared purpose and a track record of success in discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering therapies that meaningfully improve the lives of patients suffering from severe and rare diseases. Our mission at Rallybio is aligned with our expertise, and we believe we have assembled the best people, partners and science to forge new paths to life-changing therapies. Since our launch in January 2018, we have acquired a portfolio of promising product candidates that consists of five programs, and we are focused on further expanding our portfolio with the goal of making a profound impact on the lives of even more patients. We are drawing on our decades of knowledge and experience with a determination to tackle the undone, the too difficult, the inaccessible - and change the odds for rare disease patients.
Our most advanced program is for the prevention of FNAIT, a potentially life-threatening rare hematological disease that impacts fetuses and newborns. We are evaluating RLYB211, a polyclonal anti-HPA-1a antibody, in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, which we believe has established proof of concept for RLYB211 and provides support for our proposed mechanism of action. Our FNAIT program will move forward with our lead product candidate, RLYB212, a monoclonal anti-HPA-1a antibody. We submitted a CTA for RLYB212 in July 2021 and initiated a Phase 1 first-in-human trial in Germany in the fourth quarter of 2021. We are also focused on developing therapies that address diseases of complement dysregulation, including PNH, gMG, and ophthalmic disorders. RLYB116 is a novel, potentially long-acting, subcutaneously administered inhibitor of C5 in development for the treatment of patients with PNH and gMG. We received approval in the fourth quarter of 2021 for a HREC submission to support the Phase 1 trial of RLYB116 in healthy participants and in the first quarter of 2022, we initiated the Phase 1 trial in Australia. RLYB114 is a pegylated C5 inhibitor in preclinical development for the treatment of complement-mediated ophthalmic diseases, and we expect to submit an IND for this product candidate in the first half of 2023. Additionally, in collaboration with Exscientia, we have two discovery-stage programs focused on the identification of small molecule therapeutics for patients with rare metabolic diseases.
Since inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to raising capital, organizing and staffing our company, business planning, conducting discovery and research activities, acquiring or discovering product candidates, establishing and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, developing and progressing our product candidates, preparing for clinical trials and establishing arrangements with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates and component materials, including activities relating to our preclinical development and manufacturing activities for each of our five programs. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales.
Since our inception, we have funded our operations primarily through equity financings. From our inception and prior to our IPO, we received proceeds of approximately $182.5 million from equity financing. In August 2021, we closed our IPO and issued and sold 7,130,000 shares of common stock, inclusive of 930,000 shares sold pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $13.00 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $83.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs paid by us.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $175.3 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements for at least the next 18 months from the date of this report. This estimate and our expectation to advance the preclinical and clinical development of RLYB212, RLYB116, and any other product candidates are based on assumptions that
may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect, or our clinical trials may be more expensive, time consuming or difficult to design or implement than we currently anticipate. See “-Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
To date, we have devoted most of our financial resources to research and development, including our preclinical development and manufacturing activities for each of our five programs. We have not commercialized any products and have never generated revenue from the commercialization of any product.
We have incurred significant operating losses since inception, including net losses of $47.0 million and $26.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $94.0 million. These losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to incur significant additional operating losses in the foreseeable future as we advance our programs through preclinical and clinical development, expand our research and development activities, acquire and develop new product candidates, complete preclinical studies and clinical trials, finance our business development strategy, seek regulatory approval for the commercialization of our product candidates and commercialize our products, if approved. Our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:
▪advance our Phase 1 clinical trial for RLYB212, our lead product candidate for our FNAIT prevention program;
▪advance our clinical trial for RLYB116, and file an IND or a CTA for other product candidates;
▪advance our natural history alloimmunization study of FNAIT and other studies to support our development program and related regulatory submissions for RLYB212;
▪continue to develop and conduct clinical trials with respect to RLYB211;
▪seek regulatory approvals for RLYB212, RLYB116 and any other product candidates, as well as for any related companion diagnostic, if required;
▪continue and expand upon our discovery and development joint ventures with Exscientia;
▪continue to discover and develop additional product candidates;
▪hire additional clinical, scientific, and commercial personnel;
▪add operational, financial, and management personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts and to support our operations as a public company;
▪acquire or in-license other product candidates or technologies;
▪maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
▪secure a commercial manufacturing source and supply chain capacity sufficient to produce commercial quantities of any product candidate for which we obtain regulatory approval; and
▪establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize our programs, if approved, and for any other product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval.
As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Our inability to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and ability to pursue our business strategies. There can be no assurances, however, that the current operating plan will be achieved or that additional funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
In July 2021, data generated from the first cohort of healthy participants in our Phase 1/2 clinical trial for RLYB211 was presented at the ISTH Congress demonstrated the ability of an anti-HPA-1a antibody to rapidly eliminate transfused HPA-1a positive platelets from the circulation of healthy HPA-1a negative participants. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we announced additional new data from our ongoing Phase 1/2 trial of RLYB211 that demonstrated RLYB211 was able to accelerate the elimination of HPA-1a-positive platelets through 7 days following administration compared with placebo, simulating a real-world treatment approach to preventing FNAIT. Based on these results, we believe that targeting HPA-1a with an anti-HPA-1a antibody has the potential to prevent maternal alloimmunization and thereby the occurrence of FNAIT.
In the third quarter of 2021, Rallybio initiated a FNAIT natural history alloimmunization study. This prospective, non-interventional, multinational study is designed to determine the frequency of women at higher FNAIT risk among expectant mothers of different racial and ethnic characteristics, as well as the frequency of HPA-1a alloimmunization and pregnancy outcomes among these women. We expect that data from this study will be used to support future registration of RLYB212, by providing historical controlled data to support a single-arm Phase
2/3 registration trial design. Additionally, the FNAIT natural history study will operationalize de novo the laboratory test paradigm for FNAIT risk and generate FNAIT laboratory test performance data for future regulatory discussions.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we announced additional data that demonstrated RLYB211 was able to accelerate the elimination of HPA-1a-positive platelets through 7 days following administration compared with placebo, simulating a real-world treatment approach to preventing FNAIT. Based on these results, we believe that targeting HPA-1a with an anti-HPA-1a antibody has the potential to prevent maternal alloimmunization and therefore the occurrence of FNAIT. For RLYB212, our lead product candidate we initiated a Phase 1 first-in-human trial in Germany in the fourth quarter of 2021, and anticipate reporting data from a Phase 1b proof of concept trial in the third quarter of 2022.
In the fourth quarter of 2021 we received approval for a HREC submission to support the Phase 1 trial of RLYB116 in healthy participants and in the first quarter of 2022, we initiated the Phase 1 trial in Australia.
Reorganization
Prior to the IPO and the Reorganization, the Company was a 100% owned subsidiary of Rallybio Holdings, LLC ("Rallybio Holdings"), a Delaware limited liability company which was incorporated in Delaware on March 22, 2018 and Rallybio Holdings held 100% of the outstanding membership units in five wholly-owned subsidiaries; Rallybio, LLC, Rallybio IPA, LLC, Rallybio IPB, LLC, Rallybio IPD, LLC, and IPC Research, LLC. On June 30, 2021, Rallybio Holdings completed a series of transactions pursuant to which (i) Rallybio IPD, LLC, a direct subsidiary of Rallybio Holdings that was formed in Delaware in May 2020, was converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation and changed its name to Rallybio Corporation, and (ii) four direct subsidiaries of Rallybio Corporation, each a Delaware limited liability company (collectively the "Merger Subs"), each consummated a separate merger with one of Rallybio Holdings direct subsidiaries, other than Rallybio IPD, LLC (collectively the "Asset Subsidiaries"), with the Asset Subsidiaries surviving the mergers and Rallybio Holdings receiving common stock of the Company in exchange for its interest in each Asset Subsidiary, which resulted in the Asset Subsidiaries becoming subsidiaries of the Company and the Company becoming the only direct subsidiary of Rallybio Holdings. On July 28, 2021, immediately prior to the completion of the IPO, Rallybio Holdings liquidated and distributed 100% of the capital stock of the Company, consisting solely of common stock, to the unitholders of Rallybio Holdings. The liquidation of Rallybio Holdings and distribution of the capital stock of Rallybio Corporation to the unitholders of Rallybio Holdings is referred to as the “Liquidation” and these other transactions are collectively referred to as the “Reorganization.” As a result of the Reorganization and subsequent Liquidation, the unitholders of Rallybio Holdings became the holders of common stock of Rallybio Corporation, and the Company's consolidated financial statements are subsequently reported from Rallybio Corporation.
Impact of COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including at our clinical sites and the startup activities for our clinical trials, as well as our manufacturing and supply chain, and the pandemic may affect our ability to timely complete our clinical trials and delay the initiation and/or enrollment of any future clinical trials, disrupt regulatory activities or have other adverse effects on our business and operations.
We are monitoring the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial statements. To date, we have not incurred impairment losses in the carrying values of our assets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and we are not aware of any specific related event or circumstance that would require us to revise our estimates reflected in our financial statements. We plan to continue many of the protective measures we implemented in response to the pandemic and are assessing when and how to resume normal operations for office-based personnel. The effects of the public health directives and our work-from-home policies may disrupt our business and delay clinical programs and timelines and future clinical trials, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct business in the ordinary course. These and similar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions in our operations could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our ability to obtain financing.
We cannot be certain what the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will be on our business and prospects. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, including planned and future clinical trials and research and development costs, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain, including as a result of new information that may
emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions taken to contain or treat it, including the availability, administration rates and duration of efficacy of vaccines and their effectiveness against the current or new variants of the virus, and the duration and intensity of the related effects.
Components of Results of Operations
Operating Expenses
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with our research and development activities, including our drug discovery efforts and the development of our product candidates. We expense research and development costs as incurred, which include:
▪external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, such as CROs as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and other scientific development services;
▪costs related to manufacturing material for our clinical trials, including fees paid to CMOs;
▪manufacturing scale-up expenses and the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials;
▪employee-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, share-based compensation and other related costs for those employees involved in research and development efforts;
▪costs of outside consultants, including their fees, and related travel expenses;
▪the costs of acquiring and developing clinical trial materials;
▪expenses to acquire technologies, such as intellectual property, to be used in research and development including in-process research and development ("IPR&D") that has no alternative future use at the time of asset acquisitions;
▪costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and
▪facilities, depreciation and other indirect costs.
Costs for certain activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of each specific contract using information and data provided to us by our vendors and analyzing the progress of our research studies or other services performed. Significant judgments and estimates are made in determining the expenses incurred balances at the end of any reporting period.
Our direct, external research and development expenses consist primarily of fees paid to outside consultants, CROs, CMOs and research laboratories in connection with our process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. Our direct external research and development expenses also include fees incurred under license and intellectual property purchase agreements. We track these external research and development costs on a program-by-program basis.
We do not allocate employee costs, costs associated with our facilities, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific programs because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal resources and third-party consultants primarily to conduct our research and development activities as well as for managing our process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities.
The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. We plan to substantially increase our research and development expenses in the foreseeable future as we continue the development of our product candidates and manufacturing processes and conduct discovery and research activities for our clinical programs. We cannot determine with certainty the timing of initiation, the duration or the completion costs of current or future clinical trials of our product candidates due to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development. Clinical development timelines, the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which product candidates to pursue and how much funding to direct to each product candidate on an ongoing basis in response to the results of ongoing and future clinical trials, regulatory developments and our ongoing assessments as to each product candidate’s commercial potential. We will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future. Our clinical development costs are expected to increase significantly with our ongoing clinical trials. We anticipate that our
expenses will increase substantially, particularly due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing product candidates, including the uncertainty of:
▪the scope, rate of progress and expenses of our ongoing research activities and clinical trials and other research and development activities;
▪successful enrollment in and completion of clinical trials;
▪whether our product candidates show safety and efficacy in our clinical trials;
▪receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
▪establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;
▪obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates;
▪commercializing product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and
▪continued acceptable safety profile of the products following any regulatory approval.
Any changes in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates in clinical development could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of these product candidates. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. We may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials. We may elect to discontinue, delay or modify clinical trials of some product candidates or focus on others. For example, if the FDA, the EMA or another regulatory authority were to delay our planned start of clinical trials or require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we currently expect or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our planned clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development of that product candidate.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and share-based compensation for our personnel in executive, legal, business development, finance and accounting, and other administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters, professional fees paid for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services, insurance costs, travel expenses and direct and allocated facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses.
Total Other Income, Net
Total other income, net, includes interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents, interest expense and other income and expense items.
Loss on Investment in Joint Venture
The Company recognizes its pro-rata share of losses in the joint venture with Exscientia on its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss within the loss on investment in joint venture line item, with a corresponding change to the joint venture investment asset on the consolidated balance sheets for equity method investments for which it does not have a controlling interest in.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations:
Operating Expenses
Research and Development Expenses
The following table summarizes our research and development costs for each of the periods presented:
Research and development expenses were $26.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $9.3 million was primarily due to:
▪a $7.3 million increase in costs related to the development of RLYB212 mainly attributable to increased external clinical manufacturing activities and other research and development costs as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, in addition to a $2.1 million increase attributable to increased preclinical research and development costs and increased external clinical manufacturing activities related to the development of RLYB114 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, partially offset by a $2.5 million decrease in costs related to the development of RLYB211 and a $0.6 million decrease in costs related to the development of RLYB116 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020; and
▪a $2.7 million increase in personnel-related costs, including share-based compensation expense, primarily due to an increase in research and development related headcount as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
We anticipate that our research and development expenses will continue to increase as we continue our current research programs, initiate new research programs, continue our preclinical development of product candidates and conduct future clinical trials for any of our product candidates.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $11.1 million is primarily related to an increase in payroll and personnel-related costs due to an increase in general and administrative related headcount, including an increase of $2.0 million in share-based compensation, and an increase in other professional fees, costs associated with operating as a public company and an increase in business development supporting expenses.
We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we increase headcount that provide administrative support to our research and development activities. We also anticipate that we will incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance and director and officer insurance costs, as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with operating as a public company for a full year in 2022 as compared to 2021.
Total Other Income, Net
Total other income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $0.1 million compared to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in total other income of $0.2 million is primarily related to a change in estimate of our state tax credits and a decrease in interest income due to lower market interest rates during 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
Loss On Investment In Joint Venture
Loss on investment in joint venture for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $1.5 million.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
Since our inception, we have funded our operations primarily through equity financings. From our inception and prior to our IPO, we received proceeds of approximately $182.5 million from equity financings. In August 2021, we closed our IPO and issued and sold 7,130,000 shares of common stock, inclusive of 930,000 shares sold pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $13.00 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $83.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs paid by us.
As of December 31, 2021, we had $175.3 million of cash and cash equivalents.
Uses of Liquidity
We currently have no ongoing material financing commitments, such as lines of credit or guarantees, that are expected to affect our liquidity over the next five years, other than our manufacturing, licensing and lease obligations described further below.
Funding Requirements
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into at least the next 18 months from the date of this report. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could expend our capital resources sooner than we expect, or our clinical trials may be more expensive, time consuming or difficult to design or implement than we currently anticipate.
We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses in the foreseeable future as we advance our product candidates through clinical development, seek regulatory approval and pursue commercialization of any approved product candidates. Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties, length of time and scope of activities associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical product candidates, we are unable to estimate the actual amount of funds we will require for development, approval and any approved marketing and commercialization activities. Our future capital requirements, both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:
▪the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of our clinical trials through all phases of development, including our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial for RLYB211 and Phase 1 clinical trial for RLYB212, the clinical trial for RLYB116 and the development of any other product candidates;
▪the identification, assessment, acquisition and/or development of additional research programs and additional product candidates;
▪the outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including any additional clinical trials required by the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities;
▪the willingness of the FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities to accept our clinical trial designs, as well as data from our completed and planned preclinical studies and clinical trials, as the basis for review and approval of RLYB212, RLYB116 and any other product candidates;
▪the progress, timing and costs of the development by us or third parties of companion diagnostics, if required, for RLYB212 or any other product candidates, including design, manufacturing and regulatory approval;
▪the cost of filing, prosecuting and enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights;
▪the cost of defending potential intellectual property disputes, including patent infringement actions brought by third parties against us;
▪the costs associated with potential clinical trial liability or product liability claims, including the costs associated with obtaining insurance against such claims and with defending against such claims;
▪the effect of competing technological and market developments;
▪our ability to develop and commercialize products that are considered medically and/or financially differentiated to competitive products by physicians, patients and payers;
▪the cost and timing of completion of commercial-scale manufacturing activities;
▪the cost of making royalty, milestone or other payments under any future in-license agreements;
▪our ability to maintain our collaboration with Exscientia on favorable terms and establish new collaborations;
▪the extent to which we in-license or acquire additional product candidates or technologies;
▪the severity, duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may adversely impact our business;
▪the cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for our product candidates, if approved;
▪the initiation, progress and timing of our commercialization of RLYB212 and RLYB116, if approved, or any other product candidates;
▪the availability of third-party coverage and reimbursement for and pricing of any approved products; and
▪the costs of operating as a public company.
A change in the outcome of any of these, or other variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates, could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. We will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives.
In addition to the variables described above, if and when any of our product candidates successfully complete development, we will incur substantial additional costs associated with regulatory filings, marketing approval, post-marketing requirements, maintaining our intellectual property rights and regulatory protection, in addition to other commercial costs. We cannot reasonably estimate these costs at this time.
Until such time, if ever, as we generate significant revenue from product sales, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings, marketing and distribution arrangements and collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements or other sources. We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital. If we raise additional funds through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, and we may need to dedicate a substantial additional portion of any operating cash flows to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be required to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, intellectual property, future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate product candidate development or future commercialization efforts.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flows for each of the periods presented:
Operating Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities was $45.5 million as compared to $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the increase of $9.3 million in research and development for the increased efforts advancing the development of our product candidates, primarily related to RLYB212 and RLYB114, and a $11.1 million increase in general and administrative expenses related to increase in administrative supporting headcount and other professional fees associated with operating activities and becoming a public company as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily related to an increase in capital expenditures as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $83.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, representing the net proceeds from the IPO after deducting underwriting fees and commissions and payments of other offering costs. Net cash provided by financing activities was $144.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing the net proceeds from an equity financing in 2020 of $145.2 million and offering costs of $0.3 million.
Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021:
The contractual obligation amounts in the table above are associated with contracts that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the actions under the contracts.
Purchase and Other Obligations
We enter contracts in the normal course of business with CROs and other third-party vendors for clinical trials and testing and manufacturing services. Aside from those included in the table above, most contracts do not contain minimum purchase commitments and are cancellable by us upon written notice. Payments that may be due upon cancellation consist of payments for services provided or expenses incurred. These payments are not included in the table above as the amount and timing of such payments are not known.
We may incur contingent payments upon our achievement of clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones, as applicable under agreements we have entered into with various third-party entities pursuant to which we have acquired or in-licensed intellectual property. Due to the uncertainty of the achievement and timing of the events that require payment under these agreements, the amounts to be paid by us are not fixed or determinable at this time and have not been included in the table above. See “Business-License Agreement” and “Business-Asset Purchase Agreements” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of these agreements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Research and Development Expenses
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our research and development expenses that are incurred as of each reporting period. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel and with vendors to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary.
We base our expenses related to research and development activities on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid balance accordingly. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.
Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period.
Incentive Units
Certain common shares of Rallybio Corporation were issued during the Liquidation of Rallybio Holdings to previous unit holders of Rallybio Holdings in respect of profit interest incentive units. See Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation” of our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Reorganization. Prior to our IPO, we periodically granted incentive units to employees which vest over a four-year period. These incentive units were issued in the form of profits interests providing the employee with compensation equal to the increase in the value of the unit over a participation threshold per unit, as determined at the time of grant. The holder, therefore, had the right to participate in distributions of profits only in excess of such participation threshold. The participation threshold was based on the valuation of a single common unit on or around the grant date.
Prior to our IPO, we measured equity-based compensation based on the grant date fair value of the unit-based awards and recognized equity-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Unit-based compensation expense is classified in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss based on the function to which the related services are provided or in the same manner in which the grantee’s payroll costs are classified. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.
As there had been no public market for our common units, prior to the IPO, the estimated fair value of our common units had been determined by the Rallybio Holdings board of managers after considering valuation reports provided by an independent third-party valuation firm. In accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, a third-party valuation firm prepared valuations of our common units using an option pricing method ("OPM") which uses market approaches, and a Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate our enterprise value or a hybrid method, combining the OPM with the probability weighted expected return method (“PWERM”). The OPM treats common units and preferred units as call options on the total equity value of a company, with exercise prices based on the value thresholds at which the allocation among the various holders of a company’s securities changes to value the common units of the company. The PWERM values each class of equity based on an analysis of the range of potential future enterprise values of the company and the manner in which those values would accrue to the owners of the different classes of equity. The PWERM involves estimating the overall value of the subject company under various liquidity event scenarios and allocating the value to the various share classes based on their respective claim on the proceeds as of the date of each event. A discount for lack of marketability of the common units is then applied to arrive at an indication of value for the common units as of the valuation date. The OPM methodology was utilized for incentive unit grants during the first quarter 2021 while a hybrid method that incorporated both the OPM and the PWERM methodology was used for grants of incentive units in the second quarter of 2021.
There are significant judgments related to volatility and time to liquidity as well as estimates inherent in these valuations. These judgments and estimates include assumptions regarding our future operating performance, the stage of development of our product candidates, the timing of a potential IPO or other liquidity events and the determination of the appropriate valuation methodology at each valuation date. The assumptions underlying these valuations represent management’s best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our equity-based compensation expense could be materially different. Subsequent to the IPO, the fair value of our common stock was determined based on the quoted market price of our common stock.
In connection with the Liquidation, holders of common and incentive units of Rallybio Holdings received shares of common stock and restricted stock of Rallybio Corporation, based upon a conversion price determined by the board of managers of Rallybio Holdings immediately prior to the Liquidation. Holders of incentive units of Rallybio Holdings that were vested as of the consummation of the Reorganization received shares of common stock of the Corporation with respect to such units. Holders of incentive units of Rallybio Holdings that were unvested as of the consummation of the Reorganization received shares of restricted stock of the Corporation with respect to such units. The shares of restricted common stock are subject to the same vesting conditions as the incentive units for which such shares were exchanged.
Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company
As an emerging growth company (an “EGC”) under the JOBS Act, we may delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. Other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements under the JOBS Act, for EGCs include presentation of only two years of audited financial statements in a registration statement for an initial public offering, an exemption from the requirement to provide an auditor’s report on internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, an exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation, and less extensive disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements. Additionally, the JOBS Act provides that an EGC can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an EGC to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected not to “opt out” of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we will adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard and will do so until such time that we either (i) irrevocably elect to “opt out” of such extended transition period or (ii) no longer qualify as an EGC. We may choose to early adopt any new or revised accounting standards whenever such early adoption is permitted for private companies. Therefore, the reported results of operations contained in our consolidated financial statements may not be directly comparable to those of other public companies.
We are also a “smaller reporting company” meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700.0 million and our annual revenue was less than $100.0 million during the most recently completed
fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250.0 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than $100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700.0 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an EGC, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.
