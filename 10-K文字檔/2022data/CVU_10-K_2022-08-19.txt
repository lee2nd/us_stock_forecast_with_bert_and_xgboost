Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties and should be read together with the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Such risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Recent Developments
NYSE American Listing Standards Non-Compliance and Delisting Determination
On May 19, 2022, the Exchange announced the suspension of trading of our common stock due to non-compliance with the Exchange’s SEC annual and quarterly report timely filing criteria provided for in Section 1007 of the Company Guide and announced that it was initiating proceedings to delist our common stock. The Company filed a request for review of the Exchange’s determination to initiate delisting proceedings to the Committee. A hearing for this review before a Listing Qualification Panel of the Committee has been scheduled for September 7, 2022. The delisting action has been stayed pending the outcome of the review.
We will become current with our SEC reports upon the filing of the 2022 Q1 Form 10-Q and the 2022 Q2 Form 10-Q. The Company believes that becoming current with our SEC reports will resolve the condition that led to NYSE American suspending trading in the Company’s common stock on the Exchange and its determination to commence proceedings to delist the common stock from the Exchange. The 2022 Q1 Form 10-Q and 2022 Q2 Form 10-Q will be filed as soon as practicable. We cannot assure you that if the Company becomes current with our SEC reports before the Hearing or the outcome of the Hearing will result in the Exchange changing its delisting determination or that our common stock will resume trading on the Exchange in the future.
On September 17, 2021, we received notice from the Exchange indicating that the Company does not meet the continued listing standards set forth in Part 10 of the Company Guide. The Company is not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(i) of the Company Guide since it has stockholders’ equity of less than $2.0 million and losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in two of its three most recent fiscal years and Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Company Guide since it has stockholders’ equity of less than $4.0 million and losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in three of its four most recent fiscal years. The Company is therefore subject to the procedures and requirements of Section 1009 of the Company Guide and was required to, and timely did, submit a plan to the Exchange addressing how the Company intends to regain compliance with the continued listing standards by March 17, 2023 (the “Plan”). On November 19, 2021, we received notice from the Exchange that it accepted the Plan, subject to periodic review, including quarterly monitoring, for compliance with the Plan. If the Company’s common stock is not delisted from the Exchange as a result of the Company’s delayed filings as described above and (i) the Company is not in compliance with the continued listing standards by March 17, 2023 or (ii) the Company does not make progress consistent with the Plan during the plan period, the Exchange staff may initiate delisting proceedings as appropriate.
See Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - “The NYSE American exchange has suspended trading of our common stock and may delist our common stock from trading on the exchange. If our common stock is delisted from the NYSE American exchange, our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and investors’ ability to make transactions in our common stock could be adversely affected and the liquidity of our stock and our ability to obtain financing could be impaired”.
Trading of Common Stock on Expert Market
The Company is not current in its SEC reporting obligations with respect to its 2022 Q1 Form 10-Q and its 2022 Q2 Form 10-Q. Companies that are not current in their SEC reporting obligations in accordance with the provisions of Rule 15c-11 (“Rule 15c2-11”) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, do not have current information publicly available and do not meet the requirements for ongoing quoting of their securities on one of the public markets (the “OTC Markets”) operated by the OTC Markets Group. Effective July 15, 2022, the Company’s common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets Group’s “Expert Market.”
The Expert Market is available for unsolicited quotes only, meaning broker-dealers may use the Expert Market to publish unsolicited quotes representing orders from retail and institutional investors who are not affiliates or insiders of the Company. Quotations in Expert Market securities are made available to broker-dealers, institutions, and other sophisticated investors. Accordingly, investors are not assured of the opportunity to purchase or sell their shares when they desire to do so or at all.
See Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - “There is currently a very limited trading market for our common stock and investors are not assured of the opportunity to make transactions in our common stock.”
Restatement due to Inventory Costing Errors and Insufficient Reserves
As previously reported, on June 4, 2021, the audit and finance committee (the “Audit and Finance Committee”) of the board of directors of the Company determined, based on the recommendation of management and in consultation with CohnReznick LLP (“CohnReznick”), the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, that the Company’s financial statements which were included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020, and September 30, 2020 as filed with the SEC should no longer be relied upon due to errors in such financial statements relating to the recording and reporting of inventory costing and related internal controls (the “Inventory Costing Errors”) and that management’s reports on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, press releases, and investor communications describing the Company’s financial statements for such periods should no longer be relied upon. The Company’s management identified the Inventory Costing Errors during its inventory testing procedures for the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2021. At the time of the June 2021 disclosure, the Company estimated and disclosed that the Inventory Costing Errors were expected to increase the 2020 net loss reported on the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 by $1.9 million to $2.3 million. The Company has determined that the Inventory Costing Errors increased 2020 net loss by $2,010,084.
The correction of the Inventory Costing Errors resulted in the determination that certain contracts were in a loss position and certain inventory items required additional reserves. The Company reevaluated the sufficiency of its provisions for loss contracts and inventory reserves that it had previously recorded and concluded that increases to these reserves were required. The insufficient reserves resulting from such reserve increases are referred to as “Additional Inventory Reserves” and “Loss Contract Reserve” and are together referred to as the “Insufficient Reserves.” It was further determined by management that the appropriate starting point for increasing the Insufficient Reserves was during the fourth quarter of 2019.
On November 16, 2021, the Audit and Finance Committee determined, based on the analysis and recommendation of management and in consultation with CohnReznick, that the Company’s financial statements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2019 which were included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 should no longer be relied upon due to errors in such financial statements relating to the recording and reporting of the Insufficient Reserves, that, similarly, management’s reports on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, press releases, and investor communications describing the Company’s financial statements for such period should no longer be relied upon, and stated that the Company expected to restate its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020, and September 30, 2020 as filed with the SEC (the “Original Forms 10-Q”) by filing the Comprehensive Form 10-K/A.
The Company, upon conducting an analysis of the impact of the Insufficient Reserves on previously reported financial results, determined that net loss for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $324,231 and $2,189,728, respectively, greater than the net loss reported in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.
Considering both the Inventory Costing Errors and the Insufficient Reserves, the Company determined that the net loss for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $2,334,315 and $2,300,083, respectively, greater than the net loss reported in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and net loss for the quarters ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020 was $544,836 and $763,730, respectively, greater than the net loss reported in the respective Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for such periods and the net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 was $24,556 more than the net income reported in the Quarterly Report for such period.
The Inventory Costing Errors resulted from software processing and coding errors, inconsistent units of measure being used for quantities ordered and quantities received of certain purchased parts, incorrect accruals to accounting periods of the cost of certain goods received and the Company not having a procedure to address over- or under-absorbed overhead costs at the end of accounting periods. The Inventory Costing Errors affected the income reported with respect to the Company’s Non-POC Contracts. The Inventory Costing Errors did not affect income reported with respect to the Company’s POC Contracts. The Loss Contract Reserve and the Additional Inventory Reserves also only affected the income reported with respect to the Company’s Non-POC Contracts, and did not affect the income reported with respect to the Company’s POC Contracts. The Inventory Costing Errors and the Insufficient Reserves did not affect either prior reported revenue or cash flow for fiscal 2020 and 2019.
Management has considered the effect of the Inventory Costing Errors and the Insufficient Reserves on the Company’s prior conclusions of the adequacy of its internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of each of the applicable periods. As a result of the Inventory Costing Errors and the Insufficient Reserves, management has determined that a material weakness existed in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020, September 30, 2020 and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. See Part II Item 9A - Controls and Procedures within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of these matters.
As a result of the restatement caused by the Inventory Costing Errors and Insufficient Reserves, the Company reported net loss for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 which was $2,334,315 and $2,300,083, respectively, greater than the net loss reported in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (the “Original Form 10-K”) and the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, net loss for the quarters ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020 which was $544,836 and $763,730, respectively, greater than the net loss reported in the respective Original Forms 10-Q, and net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 which was $24,556 greater than the net income reported in the Original Form 10-Q. The Inventory Costing Errors and the Insufficient Reserves did not affect reported revenue or cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019, or for the quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2020.
The Comprehensive Form 10-K/A contains our audited restated annual financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, as well as our unaudited restated quarterly financial statements as of and for the quarters ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020. The restatement is discussed in more detail within Part II, Item 8 Note 16, “Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Loan
As previously reported, on April 10, 2020, we obtained a loan from Dime Community Bank (formerly BNB Bank) as the lender (“Dime”), in the principal amount of $4,795,000 (“PPP Loan”) pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act as administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”). The Company submitted its PPP Loan forgiveness application and the loan necessity questionnaire to the SBA through Dime.
On July 13, 2021, the Company received notification through Dime that the PPP Loan and accrued interest thereon were fully forgiven by the SBA and that the forgiveness payment date was July 1, 2021. The forgiveness of the PPP Loan was recognized during the Company’s third fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2021. The SBA reserves the right to audit any PPP Loan, for eligibility and other criteria, regardless of size. These audits may occur after forgiveness has been granted. In accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, all borrowers are required to maintain their PPP loan documentation for six years after the PPP Loan was forgiven and to provide that documentation to the SBA upon request.
Settlement of Class Action
As previously disclosed, a consolidated class action lawsuit has been filed against the Company, Douglas McCrosson, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer, Vincent Palazzolo, the Company’s former Chief Financial Officer, and the two underwriters of the Company’s October 16, 2018 offering of common stock, Canaccord Genuity LLC and B. Riley FBR. The Amended Complaint in the action asserts claims on behalf of two plaintiff classes: (i) purchasers of the Company’s common stock issued pursuant to and/or traceable to the Company’s offering conducted on or about October 16, 2018; and (ii) purchasers of the Company’s common stock between March 22, 2018 and February 14, 2020. The Amended Complaint alleges that the defendants violated Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act by negligently permitting false and misleading statements to be included in the registration statement and prospectus supplements issued in connection with its October 16, 2018 securities offering. The Amended Complaint also alleges that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated by the SEC, by making false and misleading statements in the Company’s periodic reports filed between March 22, 2018 and February 14, 2020. Plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory damages, including interest; rescission or a rescissory measure of damages; unspecified equitable or injunctive relief; and costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees and expert fees. On February 19, 2021, the Company moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint. Plaintiff submitted a brief in opposition to the motion to dismiss on April 23, 2021.
On May 20, 2021, the parties reached a settlement in the amount of $3,600,000, subject to court approval. On July 9, 2021, Plaintiff filed an unopposed motion for preliminary approval of the settlement. On November 10, 2021, a magistrate judge recommended that the Court grant the motion for preliminary approval in its entirety. The Court adopted the recommendation on May 27, 2022, and entered an order granting preliminary approval of the settlement on June 7, 2022. The magistrate judge will hold a hearing on September 9, 2022 to decide whether to grant final approval of the settlement. After satisfaction of our $750,000 retention, the Settlement Amount will be covered and paid by our directors’ and officers’ insurance carrier. As of March 31, 2021, we have previously paid or accrued to our financial statements covered expenses totaling $750,000, and have therefore met our directors’ and officers’ retention requirement, which caps the Company’s expenses pertaining to the class action suit.
As of December 31, 2021, in order to reflect the amounts owed from our directors’ and officers’ insurance carrier and to the Plaintiffs, we have recorded to our balance sheet a litigation settlement obligation of $3,003,259 and an insurance recovery receivable of $2,850,000; this obligation and receivable will be relieved from our balance sheet upon the payment of the Settlement Amount to the Plaintiff by our directors’ and officers’ insurance carrier.
Impact of COVID-19
The impact that the recent COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business remains uncertain.
The outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization during our first quarter of 2020. During the latter part of that quarter and subsequent to that quarter end, the COVID-19 pandemic grew, causing non-essential businesses to shut down and many people to observe the shelter-in-place directive from our state government. Our business and operations and the industries in which we operate have been impacted by public and private sector policies and initiatives in the U.S. to address the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of travel restrictions and the adoption of remote work. The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to a general slowdown in the global economy, has adversely impacted the businesses of certain of our customers and suppliers, and, if it continues for an extended period of time, it could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. In response to the COVID-19 impact on our business, we have been and continue to actively mitigate costs. We have also been taking actions to preserve capital and protect the long-term needs of our businesses, including negotiating progress payments with our customers and reducing discretionary spending. For more information on the current and potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, see Risk Factors included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
During late 2020, we began to experience an increased rate of employees testing positive for COVID-19 and we took steps to mitigate virus transmission within the workplace. These steps included adding a second manufacturing shift to lessen employee density on the manufacturing floor and to require most non-manufacturing personnel to work from home. These measures continued into 2021. Despite these measures, we experienced a relatively high level of absenteeism directly or indirectly related to COVID-19. We have taken mitigating steps in an attempt to reduce the adverse effects of COVID-19 on our business. For example, we have curtailed discretionary spending and business travel, and taken other steps to preserve cash. We have also taken action to more closely manage the flow of materials to be more responsive to unanticipated changes in customer delivery schedules. Since May 2021 and through the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have experienced a decrease in the impact of COVID-19. However, we believe that the impact of COVID-19 on illness and absence rates, workflows and productivity at the Company and our business providers has been a contributing factor to the time required for our financial statement closing processes and the delayed filing of our SEC reports. Most non-manufacturing personnel have now returned to their regular in-person work schedules and we have returned to a single day shift manufacturing operation, although we do continue to experience employees and business partners with new COVID-19 diagnoses on an intermittent basis and we take needed steps to mitigate these impacts on the Company’s operation as they occur.
Certain Transactions
The following transactions occurred during the periods covered by this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations:
Acquisition of WMI
In December 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of WMI from Air Industries for a purchase price of $7.9 million, subject to a potential post-closing working capital adjustment. Of the purchase price, $2 million was placed in escrow at closing and was to be released after the completion of the working capital adjustment and for indemnification contingencies. Air Industries objected to the Company’s calculation of the post-closing working capital adjustment and rejected the determination of BDO, the independent accountant appointed by the parties to resolve the dispute. On September 27, 2019, the Company filed a notice of motion in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, against Air Industries seeking, among other things, a judgment against Air Industries in the amount of approximately $4.1 million. In October 2019, Air Industries and the Company jointly authorized the release to the Company of approximately $619,000 from escrow, which represented the value of certain undisputed items.
The Company and Air Industries entered into a settlement agreement dated as of December 23, 2020, to resolve the post-closing working capital adjustment dispute in exchange for the release to the Company of the $1,381,000 cash remaining in escrow. Such amount was released from escrow to the Company on December 28, 2020. As part of the settlement agreement CPI Aero agreed to give up the right to pursue the additional disputed working capital amount of approximately $2.1 million.
Honda Aircraft Company, Inc. Settlement and Release Agreement
In January 2020, the Company requested a modification to the recurring sales price contained in the Master Purchase Agreement dated January 14, 2019 (“Honda MPA”) with Honda Aircraft Company, Inc. (“HACI”) for the manufacture of engine inlet assemblies for the HondaJet aircraft. HACI denied the Company’s request. HACI and the Company subsequently commenced discussions that would result in the Company exiting the program. On December 23, 2020 HACI and the Company entered into a Settlement and Release Agreement that, subject to the terms and conditions therein, terminates the Honda MPA and cancels all remaining purchase orders placed with the Company thereunder.
Gulfstream G650 Program
On April 29, 2020, the Company received a letter from Triumph Group stating that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it had received a significant schedule change from its customer, Gulfstream Aerospace, and requested that we immediately stop work on the contract we have to produce certain fixed leading edge assemblies on the wing of the G650 business jet. In May 2020, Triumph Group cancelled nearly all open orders with the Company, decreasing our G650 leading edge backlog by $3.6 million. On May 27, 2020, Triumph Group announced it had reached an agreement in principle to sell the G650 wing program to Gulfstream Aerospace. On June 12, 2020, the Company received a joint communication from Gulfstream Aerospace and Triumph Group that stated Gulfstream Aerospace’s intention at the conclusion of the transaction is to continue to purchase G650 wing components from the Company. In December 2020, the Company received purchase orders from Gulfstream Aerospace for G650 wing components.
Business Operations
We are engaged in the contract production of structural aircraft parts for fixed wing aircraft and helicopters in both the commercial and defense markets. We also have a strong and growing presence in the aerosystems segment of the market, with our production of various reconnaissance pod structures and fuel panel systems. Within the global aerostructure and aerosystem supply chain, we are either a Tier 1 supplier to aircraft OEMs or a Tier 2 subcontractor to major Tier 1 manufacturers. We also are a prime contractor to the U.S. DOD, primarily the USAF. In conjunction with our assembly operations, we provide engineering, program management, supply chain management and kitting, and MRO services.
Critical Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
In accordance with ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when it transfers control of a promised good or service to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for the good or service. The majority of the Company’s performance obligations are satisfied over time as the Company (i) sells products with no alternative use to the Company and (ii) has an enforceable right to recover costs incurred plus a reasonable profit margin for work completed to date. Under the overtime revenue recognition model, revenue and gross profit are recognized over the contract period as work is performed based on actual costs incurred and an estimate of costs to complete and resulting total estimated costs at completion. See Part II, Item 8, Note 2 “Revenue Recognition” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company’s revenue recognition policy.
Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. The Company capitalizes labor, material, subcontractor and overhead costs as work-in-process for contracts where control has not yet passed to the customer. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with its suppliers, and the estimated usability for its inventory. If the Company’s review indicates a reduction in usability below carrying value, it reduces its net inventory to a new cost basis.
Leases
The Company does not recognize right-of-use (“ROU”) assets or lease liabilities, and this includes not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases. In addition, the Company does not separate lease and non-lease components for certain classes of assets (office building).
The Company’s ROU assets and lease liabilities at December 31, 2021 were approximately $7.8 million and $8.0 million, respectively, using an estimated incremental borrowing rate of 5%, as compared to ROU assets and lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020 of $4.1 million and $4.4 million, respectively.
Goodwill
In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (“ASU-2017-04). ASU 2017-04 is intended to simplify how all entities assess goodwill for impairment. This is accomplished by removing the requirement to determine the fair value of individual assets and liabilities in order to calculate a reporting unit’s “implied” goodwill. The goodwill impairment test consists of one step comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.
An entity may still perform the optional qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. However, the ASU 2017-04 eliminates the requirement to perform a qualitative assessment for any reporting unit with zero or negative carrying amount. The Company adopted ASU-2017-4 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Results of Operations
The following discussion provides an analysis of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
Revenue. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $103,369,544 compared to $87,584,690 for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing an increase of $15,784,854 or 18%. We experienced revenue increases on our Raytheon Next Generation Jammer (“NGJ”) Pod program, Raytheon NRC Wing program and USAF T-38 Pacer Classic program.
Revenue generated from prime government contracts for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $3,658,383 compared to $9,115,983 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $5,457,600. This decrease is primarily a result of decreased revenue recognized on the T-38 Pacer Classic program and the program.
Revenue generated from government subcontracts for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $93,663,383 compared to $70,106,741 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $23,556,642. The increase in revenue related to increases in the following programs; Raytheon Next Generation Jammer (“NGJ”) Pod program, the Raytheon NRC Wing program, the Pacer Classic III Phase 3 program, the Boeing A-10 program, the Northrop Grumman WOWP program and the Lockheed Martin lock program.
Revenue generated from commercial contracts for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $6,047,779 compared to $8,361,966 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $2,314,187. The decrease in revenue resulted from the decrease in the HondaJet program and the Sikorsky S-92 Kit program.
Cost of sales. Cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $88,364,452 and $77,824,732, respectively, an increase of $10,539,720, or 14%.
The components of cost of sales were as follows:
Procurement for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $64,628,025 compared to $56,337,476 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $8,290,549 or 14.7%. This increase is primarily the result of an increase in procurement for the Sikorsky HIRSS program, Raytheon NGJ Mid-Band Pod Program, Raytheon Multi-Purpose Booster Development Wing Assembly program and the Boeing A-10 Re-wing programs.
Labor costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $7,843,520 compared to $6,414,658 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $1,428,862 or 22.3%. The increase is primarily the result of labor associated with the Raytheon NGJ Mid-Band Pod program, the Northrop Grumman Tubes program, the Boeing A-10 Re-wing program, and the Lockheed Martin Rudder Island program, which were very labor intensive.
Factory overhead costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $19,462,924 compared to $20,803,029 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $1,340,105 or 6.4%. The decrease is primarily the result of more productivity on programs such as the Raytheon NGJ Mid-Band Pod program, the Northrop Grumman E-2D program, the Northrop Grumman Outer Wing Panel program, the Northrop Grumman Wet Outer Wing Panel Program, and the Boeing A-10 Re-wing program, which led to higher labor absorption rates and lower overhead costs.
Other cost of sales relates to items that can increase or decrease cost of sales such as changes in inventory levels, changes in inventory valuation, changes to inventory reserves, changes in loss contract provisions and direct charges to cost of sales. For the year ended December 31, 2021, there was a reduction of costs in the amount of ($3,570,017), primarily the result of changes in inventory levels and reductions in loss contract reserves. For the year ended December 31, 2020, there was a reduction in costs of ($5,730,431), primarily the result of changes in inventory levels and reductions in loss contract reserves.
Gross profit. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $15,005,092 compared to $9,759,958 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $5,245,134 or 54%. Gross profit percentage (“gross margin”) for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 14.5% compared to 11.1% for year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily on the Raytheon NGJ Mid-Band Pod program, the Northrop Grumman E-2D program, the Northrop Grumman Outer Wing Panel program, the Northrop Grumman Wet Outer Wing Panel program, and the Boeing A-10 Re-wing program, which experienced growth in revenue, and a decrease in factory overhead costs.
Favorable/Unfavorable Adjustments to Gross Profit
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we made changes in estimates to various contracts. Such changes in estimates resulted in changes in total gross profit as follows:
Selling, general and administrative expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $11,823,921 compared to $12,046,171 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $222,250 or 1.8%. This decrease was primarily due to decreased legal and accounting expenses compared to the prior period, which included the costs associated with the 2018 and 2019 restatement of our consolidated financial statements, partially offset by increases in our business insurance premiums during 2021.
Other income
Other income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $4,795,000, compared to nil for the year ended December 31, 2020. The other income in 2021 was due to the forgiveness of the PPP loan by the SBA on July 31, 2021.
Interest expense
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1,141,189, compared to $1,421,955 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $280,766 or 19.7%. The decrease in interest expense is the result of continued principal repayment on our term loan with Bank United.
Income (loss) before provision for income taxes
We had an income before provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $6,834,982 compared to a loss before provision from income taxes of ($3,708,167) for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $10,543,149. Excluding the PPP loan forgiveness by the SBA on July 1, 2021, our income before provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $2,039,982, an increase over the prior year of $5,748,149, which was driven by the increase in gross profit, decrease in SG&A and decrease in interest expense described above.
Provision (benefit) for income taxes. The income tax provision (benefit) for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $14,609, an effective tax rate of 0.21%, compared to a benefit of ($53,414) for the year ended December 31, 2020, an effective tax rate of (1.4)%. The income tax provision in 2021 is mostly the result of state franchise and minimum taxes. The tax benefit in 2020 consists of a refund received from the 2014 NOL carryback claim and state minimum taxes. In February 2019, the Company received information that the net operating loss carryback that was utilized in 2014 was under examination and could possibly be partially disallowed by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). This adjustment was an issue of timing of the loss and had no income tax provision effect. In June 2020, the Company received a letter from the IRS stating that the returns will be accepted as filed. In September 2020, the Company received additional refunds related to the tax years under examination. The examination is now closed and there is no uncertain tax position recorded for this item.
Net income (loss)
Net income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $6,820,373 compared to a net loss of $(3,654,753) for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net income was driven by the increase in gross profit, the PPP loan forgiveness by the SBA on July 1, 2021, the decrease in SG&A and the decrease in interest expense, partly offset by an increase in provision for income taxes. Basic and diluted earnings per share was $0.56 for the year ended December 31, 2021 calculated utilizing 12,193,826 weighted average shares outstanding. Basic and diluted loss per share was $(0.31) for the year ended December 31, 2020 calculated utilizing 11,884,307 weighted average shares outstanding.
Excluding the $4,795,000 PPP loan forgiveness by the SBA on July 1, 2021, our net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $2,025,373, an increase over the prior year of $5,680,126, which was driven by the increase in gross profit, the decrease in SG&A and the decrease in interest expense, partly offset by an increase in provision for income taxes. Excluding the aforementioned PPP loan forgiveness by the SBA on July 1, 2021, our basic and diluted earnings per share was $0.17 as compared to the $(0.31) loss per basic and diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Business Outlook
The statements in the “Business Outlook” section and other forward-looking statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
General. At December 31, 2021, we had working capital of $12,175,776 compared to working capital of $7,674,974 at December 31, 2020, an increase of $4,500,802, or 58.6%. This increase is primarily the result of a decrease in accounts payable and an increase in contract assets, net.
Cash Flow. A large portion of our cash is used to pay for materials and processing costs associated with contracts that are in process and which do not provide for progress payments. Costs for which we are not able to bill on a progress basis are components of contract assets on our consolidated balance sheet and represent the aggregate costs and related earnings for uncompleted contracts for which the customer has not yet been billed. These costs and earnings are recovered upon shipment of products and presentation of billings in accordance with contract terms.
Because ASC 606 requires us to use estimates in determining revenues, costs and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods, there can be a significant disparity between earnings (both for accounting and tax purposes) as reported and actual cash that we receive during any reporting period. Accordingly, it is possible that we may have a shortfall in our cash flow and may need to borrow money or take steps to defer cash outflows until the reported earnings materialize into actual cash receipts.
Several of our programs require us to expend up-front costs that may have to be amortized over a portion of production units. In the case of significant program delays and/or program cancellations, we could experience margin degradation, which may be material for costs that are not recoverable. Such charges and the loss of up-front costs could have a material impact on our liquidity and results of operations.
We continue to work to obtain better payment terms with our customers, including accelerated progress payment arrangements, as well as exploring alternative funding sources.
At December 31, 2021, our cash balance was $6,308,866 compared to $6,033,537 at December 31, 2020, an increase of $275,329. Our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2021 of $4,967,714 was nearly the same as the balance at December 31, 2020 of $4,962,906.
BankUnited Facility
On March 24, 2016, the Company entered into the Credit Agreement. The BankUnited Facility originally provided for a revolving credit loan commitment of $30 million (the “Revolving Loan”) and a $10 million term loan (“Term Loan”). The Revolving Loan bears interest at a rate based upon a pricing grid, as defined in the Credit Agreement.
On August 24, 2020, the Company entered into a Sixth Amendment and Waiver to the Credit Agreement (the “Sixth Amendment”). Under the Sixth Amendment, the parties amended the Credit Agreement by extending the maturity date of the Revolving Loan and Term Loan to May 2, 2022 and making conforming changes to the repayment schedule of the Term Loan. The availability under the Revolving Loan was reduced by $6 million, to $24 million, and the outstanding principal amount on the Term Note was increased to approximately $7,933,000.
On May 11, 2021, the Company entered into a Waiver and Seventh Amendment (“Seventh Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. Under the Seventh Amendment, the parties amended the Credit Agreement by (a) extending the maturity date of the Revolving Loan and the Term Loan to July 31, 2022, and (b) amending the leverage ratio covenant. Additionally, under the Seventh Amendment, BankUnited waived late delivery of certain financial information.
On October 28, 2021, the Company entered into a Waiver and Eighth Amendment (the “Eighth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. Under the Eighth Amendment, the parties amended the Credit Agreement by (a) extending the maturity date of the Revolving Loan and the Term Loan to December 31, 2022, (b) reducing the availability under the Revolving Loan from $24 million to $21 million while eliminating the requirement to maintain a minimum $3.0 million in a combination of Revolving Loan availability and unrestricted cash, (c) providing for the repayment of an additional $750,000 of the principal balance of the Term Loan in three installments of $250,000 on November 30, 2021, December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022 in addition to $200,000 regular monthly principal payments through December 31, 2022, (d) amending the minimum debt service coverage ratio covenant, and (e) amending the maximum leverage coverage ratio. Additionally, under the Eighth Amendment, BankUnited waived certain covenant non-compliance and waived temporarily, late delivery of certain financial information. In connection with the Eighth Amendment, a $250,000 amendment fee (the “Amendment Fee”) was earned by the lenders on December 31, 2021 which the Company elected to pay in kind and accrue and capitalize rather than pay in cash. As at December 31, 2021, the Amendment Fee payable was posted by BankUnited to the Revolving Loan and on February 11, 2022, in agreement with the Company, the Amendment Fee was reclassified by BankUnited to the Term Loan. The Company has recorded this payable to its financial statements accordingly.
On April 12, 2022 the Company entered into a Consent, Waiver and Ninth Amendment (the “Ninth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. Under the Ninth Amendment, the parties amended the Credit Agreement by (a) extending the maturity date of the Revolving Loan and the Term Loan to September 30, 2023, (b) providing for the repayment of an additional $750,000 of the principal balance of the Term Loan in three installments of $250,000 on September 30, 2022, December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023 in addition to $200,000 regular monthly principal payments through December 31, 2022 and (c) increasing the interest on the Revolving Loan, Term Loan, and the Amendment Fee as follows: through June 30, 2022, Prime Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus 2.5%; from July 1, 2022 through August 31, 2022, Prime Rate plus 5%; from September 1, 2022 through October 31, 2022, Prime Rate plus 6%; from November 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022, Prime Rate plus 7%; and from January 1, 2023 through September 30, 2023, Prime Rate plus 8%.

The Credit Agreement, as amended, requires us to maintain the following financial covenants (subject to the exclusions provided for in the previous paragraph): (a) minimum debt service coverage ratio of no less than 1.5 to 1.0 for the trailing four quarter period ended March 31, 2022, 0.95 to 1.0 for the trailing four quarter period ended June 30, 2022, and 1.5 to 1.0 for the trailing four quarter period ended September 30, 2022 and for the trailing four quarter periods ended thereafter; (b) maximum leverage ratio of no less than 7.30 to 1.0 for the trailing four quarter period ended March 31, 2022, 6.30 to 1.0 for the trailing four quarter period ended June 30, 2022, 5.0 to 1.0 for the trailing four quarter period ended September 30, 2022 and 4.0 to 1 for the trailing four quarter periods thereafter; (c) minimum net income after taxes as of the end of each fiscal quarter being no less than $1.00 commencing June 30, 2022; and (d) a minimum adjusted EBITDA at the end of each quarter of no less than $1.0 million (waived for the quarter ended March 31, 2022). The additional principal payments, increase in interest and the Amendment Fee provided for in the Eight Amendment and Ninth Amendment are excluded for purposes of calculating compliance with each of the financial covenants.
PPP Loan
On April 10, 2020, we entered into the PPP Loan, with BNB Bank (now part of Dime Community Bank (“Dime”)) as the lender, in an aggregate principal amount of $4,795,000, pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program under the CARES Act. On November 2, 2020, the Company applied to the lender for full forgiveness of the PPP Loan as calculated in accordance with the terms of the CARES Act, as modified by the Paycheck Protection Flexibility Act. On July 13, 2021, the Company received notification through Dime that the PPP Loan and accrued interest thereon were fully forgiven by the Small Business Association and that the forgiveness payment date was July 1, 2021. The forgiveness of the PPP Loan was recognized during the Company’s third fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2021. The PPP Loan was evidenced by a promissory note (the “Note”) and, subject to the terms of the Note, the PPP Loan had a fixed interest rate interest of one percent (1%) per annum, with the first six months of interest deferred and had an initial term of two years. The SBA reserves the right to audit any PPP Loan, for eligibility and other criteria, regardless of size. These audits may occur after forgiveness has been granted. In accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), all borrowers are required to maintain their PPP loan documentation for six years after the PPP Loan was forgiven and to provide that documentation to the SBA upon request. All amounts are classified as current or long term in accordance with the Note terms.
Liquidity
Our working capital requirements can vary significantly, depending in part on the timing of the conclusion of mature programs and new program awards and the payment terms with our customers and suppliers. There is currently no availability for borrowings under the BankUnited Facility and the Company finances its operations from internally generated cash flow. Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8 includes a discussion regarding the BankUnited Facility and recent amendments thereto which provide, among other things, for increases in principal payments and the interest rate on the loans provided for therein. Also, the Company currently has a shareholders’ deficit and has experienced losses from operations and negative cash flows from operations in prior periods. These factors collectively represent significant risk to the Company’s ability to continue to operate as a going concern. Management has assessed these risks and to address them, the Company has (i) negotiated and executed a further amendment to the Credit Agreement which extended the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to September 30, 2023, (ii) obtained and is seeking additional progress payment and advance payment customer contract funding provisions, (iii) maintained procedures to reduce investments in inventory and contract assets, (iv) remained focused on its military segment which has proven to be less susceptible to COVID-19 related impacts and (v) maintained its approximately $135 million backlog of funded orders, 98% of which are for military programs. Based upon this assessment and the execution of the plans described above it is management’s estimation that there will likely not be any individual conditions or combination of events that will occur in the coming year which would cause the Company to be unable to meet its obligations or otherwise continue as a going concern. However, there can be no assurance that such plans will accomplish their intended goals.
Cost Reduction Initiative
During the first quarter of 2022, the Company began a cost reduction initiative designed to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs during fiscal year 2022. Management is reallocating resources and reducing operating and general administrative expenses to more properly align the Company’s costs to anticipated near-term revenue given the timing differences between the conclusion of certain mature programs and the commencement of new programs in 2022. The Company executed a headcount reduction and furlough action in March 2022 and is implementing cost controls and cuts during the balance of fiscal year 2022. The Company anticipates recording severance costs related to the headcount reduction in its first fiscal quarter of 2022 and the cost reductions of these actions are anticipated to positively impact the financial results of the Company beginning in the second fiscal quarter of 2022.
Contractual Obligations.
The table below summarizes information about our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021 and the effects these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future years. The Company is required to make $4,733,333 in principal payments on its outstanding term loan payable within three years from December 31, 2021, $422,595 in payments on its outstanding equipment capital lease obligations within five years from December 31, 2021 and $8,026,181 in payments on its outstanding building and equipment operating lease obligations within, primarily, five years from December 31, 2021.
Inflation.
Inflation historically has not had a material effect on our operations. The Company’s long term contracts with both its customers and suppliers reflect fixed pricing. When bidding for work, the Company takes inflation risk and supply side pricing risk into account in its proposals.
