This Item 7 presents information to assess the financial condition and results of operations of Premier. This item should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the supplemental financial data contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), this report includes non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional information that is useful to investors in helping to understand the underlying performance and trends of the Company. The Company monitors the non-GAAP financial measures and the Company’s management believes such measures are helpful to investors because they provide an additional tool to use in evaluating the Company’s financial and business trends and operating results. In addition, the Company’s management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare the Company’s performance to that of prior periods for trend analysis and for budgeting and planning purposes.
Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, which are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Readers should be aware of these limitations and should be cautious with respect to the use of such measures. To mitigate these limitations, the Company has practices in place to ensure that these measures are calculated using the appropriate GAAP or regulatory components in their entirety and to ensure that our performance is properly reflected to facilitate consistent period-to-period comparisons. The Company’s method of calculating these non-GAAP measures may differ from methods used by other companies. Although the Company believes the non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this report enhance investors' understanding of our business and performance, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for those financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) is an adjustment to net interest income to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis. The following tables present a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their respective GAAP measures for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Financial Condition
Assets at December 31, 2021 totaled $7.48 billion compared to $7.21 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $0.27 billion or 3.7%. The increase in assets was primarily due to an increase in securities offset by a decrease in loans. The net increase was primarily the result of an increase in total deposits of $228.4 million and equity of $41.2 million.
Securities
The securities portfolio increased $482.6 million, or 65.4%, to $1.22 billion at December 31, 2021. This increase is primarily a result of an increase in deposits of $228.4 million and a decrease in gross loans including held for sale of $253.7 million. The increase was partially offset by runoff, sales and amortization. For additional information regarding Premier’s investment securities see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Loans
Loans receivable, net of undisbursed loan funds and deferred fees and costs, decreased $195.1 million, or 3.6%, to $5.30 billion at December 31, 2021. The decrease was mainly due to a $328.0 million decrease in Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans offset by an increase of $132.9 million in non-PPP loans. For more details on the loan balances, see Note 7 - Loans Receivable to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The majority of Premier’s commercial real estate and commercial loans are to small- and mid-sized businesses. The combined commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios, including PPP, totaled $3.35 billion and $3.59 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and accounted for approximately 63.3% and 65.3% of Premier’s loan portfolio at the end of those respective periods. Premier believes it has been able to establish itself as a leader in its market area in commercial and commercial real estate lending by hiring experienced lenders and providing a high level of customer service to its commercial lending clients.
The one-to-four family residential portfolio totaled $1.17 billion at December 31, 2021, compared with $1.20 billion at the end of 2020, with the decrease due to payoffs/paydowns in excess of new originations. At the end of 2021, such loans comprised 22.1% of the total loan portfolio, up from 21.9% at December 31, 2020.
Construction loans, which include one-to-four residential family and commercial real estate properties, increased to $384.9 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $312.6 million at December 31, 2020. These loans accounted for approximately 7.3% and 5.7% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Home equity and home improvement loans decreased to $264.4 million at December 31, 2021, from $272.7 million at the end of 2020. At the end of 2021, those loans comprised 5.0% of the total loan portfolio, consistent with 5.0% at December 31, 2020.
Consumer finance loans were $126.4 million at December 31, 2021 up from $120.7 million at the end of 2020. These loans accounted for approximately 2.4% and 2.2% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
In order to properly assess the collateral dependent loans included in its loan portfolio, the Company has established policies regarding the monitoring of the collateral underlying such loans. The Company requires an appraisal that is less than one year old for all new collateral dependent real estate loans, and all renewed collateral dependent real estate loans where significant new money is extended. The appraisal process is handled by the Bank’s Credit Department, which selects the appraiser and orders the appraisal. Premier’s loan policy prohibits the account officer from talking or communicating with the appraiser to insure that the appraiser is not influenced by the account officer in any way in making a determination of value. The Bank generally does not require updated appraisals for performing loans unless significant new money is requested by the borrower.
When a collateral dependent loan is downgraded to classified status, the Bank reviews the most current appraisal on file and, if appropriate, based on the Bank’s assessment of the appraisal, such as age, market, etc. the Bank will discount the appraisal amount to a more appropriate current value based on inputs from lenders and realtors. This amount may then be discounted further by the Bank’s estimation of the selling costs. In most instances, if the appraisal is more than twelve to fifteen months old, a new appraisal may be required. Finally, the Bank assesses whether there is any collateral short fall, taking into consideration guarantor support and liquidity, and determines if a charge-off is necessary.
All loans over 90 days past due and/or on non-accrual are classified as non-performing loans. Non-performing status automatically occurs in the month in which the 90-day delinquency occurs. When a collateral dependent loan moves to non-performing status, the Bank generally gets a new third party appraisal and charges the loan down appropriately based upon the new appraisal and an estimate of costs to liquidate the collateral. All properties that are moved into the Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”) category are supported by current appraisals, and the OREO is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, which is determined based on appraised value less the Bank’s estimate of the liquidation costs.
The Bank does not adjust any appraisals upward without written documentation of this valuation change from the appraiser. When setting reserves and charge-offs on classified loans, appraisal values may be discounted downward based upon the Bank’s experience with liquidating similar properties.
Appraisals are received within approximately 60 days after they are requested. The Bank’s Special Assets Committee reviews the amount of each new appraisal and makes any necessary charge-off decisions at its meeting prior to the end of each quarter.
Any partially charged-off collateral dependent loans are considered non-performing, and as such, would need to show an extended period of time with satisfactory payment performance as well as cash flow coverage capability supported by current financial statements before the Bank will consider an upgrade to performing status. The Bank may consider moving the loan to accruing status after approximately six months of satisfactory payment performance. The Bank monitors and tracks its loan to value quarterly to determine accuracy and any necessary charge-offs. Based on these results, changes may occur in the processes used.
Loan modifications constitute a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) if the Bank, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower’s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. For loans that are considered TDRs and the balance is over $500,000, the Bank either computes the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the original loan’s effective interest rate or it may measure impairment based on the fair value of the collateral. For those loans measured for impairment utilizing the present value of future cash flows method, any discount is carried as a specific reserve in the allowance for credit losses. For those loans measured for impairment utilizing the fair value of the collateral, any shortfall is charged-off. For loans that are considered TDRs and the balance is under $500,000 a specific reserve is carried in the allowance for credit losses based on a general reserve analysis. Loan modifications made as a result of COVID-19 may not be deemed TDR if certain criteria are met based on regulatory guidance. As of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, the Bank had $7.8 million and $7.2 million, respectively, of loans that were still performing and which were classified as TDRs.
Allowance for Credit Losses (“ACL”)
The Company adopted ASU 2016-13, the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model on January 1, 2020. Under CECL, a valuation reserve was established in the ACL and maintained through expense in the provision for credit losses. Upon adoption of CECL, the Company made a one-time adjustment, net of taxes, to retained earnings for $1.9 million. The ACL represents management’s assessment of the estimated credit losses the Company will receive over the life of the loan. ACL requires a projection of credit losses over the contract lifetime of the credit adjusted for prepayment tendencies. Management analyzes the adequacy of the ACL regularly through reviews of the loan portfolio. Consideration is given to economic conditions, changes in interest rates and the effect of such changes on collateral values and borrowers’ ability to pay, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and trends in past due and non-performing loan balances. The ACL is a material estimate that is susceptible to significant fluctuation and is established through a provision for credit losses based on management’s evaluation of the inherent risk in the loan portfolio. In addition to extensive in-house loan monitoring procedures, the Company utilizes an outside party to conduct an independent loan review of commercial loan and commercial real estate loan relationships. The Company’s goal is to have 45-50% of the portfolio reviewed annually using a risk based approach. Management utilizes the results of this outside loan review to assess the effectiveness of its internal loan grading system as well as to assist in the assessment of the overall adequacy of the ACL associated with these types of loans.
The ACL is made up of two basic components. The first component of the allowance for credit loss is the specific reserve in which the Company sets aside reserves based on the analysis of individually analyzed credits. In establishing specific reserves, the Company analyzes all substandard, doubtful and loss graded loans quarterly and makes judgments about the risk of loss based on the cash flow of the borrower, the value of any collateral and the financial strength of any guarantors. If the loan is individually analyzed and cash flow dependent, then a specific reserve is established for the discount on the net present value of expected future cash flows. If the loan is individually analyzed and collateral dependent, then any shortfall is usually charged off. The Company also considers the impacts of any Small Business Administration (“SBA”) or Farm Service Agency (“FSA”) guarantees. The specific reserve portion of the ACL was $7.1 million at December 31, 2021, and $4.3 million at December 31, 2020.
The second component is a general reserve, which is used to record credit loss reserves for groups of homogenous loans in which the Company estimates the potential losses over the contractual lifetime of the loan adjusted for prepayment tendencies. In addition, the future economic environment is incorporated in projections with loss expectations to revert to the long-run historical mean after such time as management can no longer make or obtain a reasonable and supportable forecast. For purposes of the general reserve analysis, the six loan portfolio segments are further segregated into 13 different loan pools to allocate the ACL. Residential real estate is further segregated into owner occupied and nonowner occupied for ACL. Commercial real estate is split into owner occupied, nonowner occupied, multifamily, agriculture land and other commercial real estate. Commercial credits are comprised of commercial working capital, agriculture production, and other commercial credits. The Company utilizes three different methodologies to analyze loan pools.
Discounted cash flows (“DCF”) was selected as the appropriate method for loan segments with longer average lives and regular payment structures. This method is applied to a majority of the Company’s real estate loans. DCF generates cash flow projections at the instrument level where payment expectations are adjusted for prepayment and curtailment to produce an expected cash flow stream. This expected cash flow stream is compared to the net present value of expected cash flows to establish a valuation account for these loans.
The probability of default/loss given default (“PD/LGD”) methodology was selected as most appropriate for loan segments with average lives of three years or less and/or irregular payment structures. This methodology was used for home equity and commercial portfolios. A loan is considered to default if one of the following is detected:
•Becomes 90 days or more past due;
•Is placed on nonaccrual;
•Is marked as a TDR; or
•Is partially or wholly charged-off.
The default rate is measured on the current life of the loan segment using a weighted average of the four most recent quarters. PD/LGD is determined on a dollar-ratio basis, measuring the ratio of net charged off principal to defaulted principal.
The consumer portfolio contains loans with many different payment structures, payment streams and collateral. The remaining life method was deemed most appropriate for these loans. The weighted average remaining life uses an annual charge-off rate over several vintages to estimate credit losses. The average annual charge-off rate is applied to the contractual term adjusted for prepayments.
Additionally, CECL requires a reasonable and supportable forecast when establishing the ACL. The Company estimates losses over an approximate one-year forecast period using Moody’s baseline economic forecasts, and then reverts to longer term historical loss experience over a three-year period.
The quantitative general allowance decreased to $12.3 million at December 31, 2021, from $29.2 million at December 31, 2020, primarily due to the impact of the economic improvement in 2021 after the downturn in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In addition to the quantitative analysis, a qualitative analysis is performed each quarter to provide additional general reserves on the loan portfolios not individually analyzed for various factors. The overall qualitative factors are based on nine sub-factors. The nine sub-factors have been aggregated into three qualitative factors: economic, environment and risk.
ECONOMIC
1)Changes in international, national and local economic business conditions and developments, including the condition of various market segments.
2)Changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans.
ENVIRONMENT
3)Changes in the nature and volume in the loan portfolio.
4)The existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations.
5)Changes in lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off and recovery practices.
6)Changes in the quality and breadth of the loan review process.
7)Changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff.
RISK
8)Changes in the trends of the volume and severity of delinquent and classified loans, and changes in the volume of non-accrual loans, TDRs, and other loan modifications.
9)Changes in the political and regulatory environment.
The qualitative analysis indicated a general reserve of $47.1 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $48.8 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease was mainly due to changes in the economy as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recovery. Management reviewed the overall economic, environmental and risk factors and determined that it was appropriate to make adjustments to these sub-factors based on that review. The economic factors for all loan segments decreased in 2021, primarily due to a recovery in the national economy, a decrease in local unemployment levels and improved uncertainty in global economic conditions. The risk factors for all loan segments except residential increased in 2021 primarily due to the loosening of lending standards. The Company’s general reserve percentages for main loan segments, not otherwise classified, ranged from 0.78% for construction loans to 1.59% for home equity/improvement loans at December 31, 2021.
Under CECL, when loans are purchased with evidence of more than insignificant deterioration of credit, they are accounted for as purchase credit deteriorated (“PCD”). PCD loans acquired in a transaction are marked to fair value and a mark on yield is recorded. In addition, an adjustment is made to the ACL for the expected loss through retained earnings on the acquisition date. These loans are assessed on a regular basis and subsequent adjustments to the ACL are recorded on the income statement. On January 31, 2020, as a result of the Merger, the Company acquired PCD loans with a fair value of $79.1 million, a recorded adjustment on yield of $4.1 million and an increase to the ACL of $7.7 million.
As a result of the quantitative and qualitative analyses, along with the change in specific reserves and the increase in net charge-offs during the year, the Company’s provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2021 was a recovery of $6.7 million. This is compared to an expense of $43.2 million, which included $25.9 million attributable to the Merger, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The ACL was $66.5 million at December 31, 2021, and $82.1 million at December 31, 2020. The ACL represented 1.26% of loans, net of undisbursed loan funds and deferred fees and costs at December 31, 2021, and 1.49% at December 31, 2020. In management’s opinion, the overall ACL of $66.5 million as of December 31, 2021, was adequate to cover anticipated losses over the lifetime of the loans.
Management also assesses the value of OREO as of the end of each accounting period and recognizes write-downs to the value of that real estate in the income statement if conditions dictate. During the year ended December 31, 2021, there were $81,000 in write-downs of real estate held for sale. Management believes that the values recorded at December 31, 2021, for OREO and repossessed assets represent the realizable value of such assets.
Total classified loans decreased to $69.5 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $90.4 million at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $20.9 million, primarily due to improved asset quality and net charge-offs.
The Company’s ratio of ACL to non-performing loans was 138.4% at December 31, 2021, compared to 158.8% at December 31, 2020. Management monitors collateral values of all loans included on the watch list that are collateral dependent and believes that allowances for such loans at December 31, 2021, were appropriate. Of the $48.0 million in non-accrual loans at December 31, 2021, $23.1 million or 48.2% are less than 90 days past due.
At December 31, 2021, the Company had total non-performing assets of $48.2 million, compared to $52.0 million at December 31, 2020. Non-performing assets include loans that are on non-accrual, OREO and other assets held for sale. The OREO balance was $171,000 and $343,000 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The net charge-offs and non-accrual loan balances as a percentage of total are presented in the table below at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
The following table sets forth information concerning the allocation of Premier’s allowance for credit losses by loan categories at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Loans Acquired with Impairment
Under ASU Topic 326, when loans are purchased with evidence of more than insignificant deterioration of credit, they are accounted for as PCD. PCD loans acquired in a transaction are marked to fair value and a mark on yield is recorded. In addition, an adjustment is made to the ACL for the expected loss on the acquisition date. These loans are assessed on a regular basis and subsequent adjustments to the ACL are recorded on the income statement.
High Loan-to-Value Mortgage Loans
The majority of Premier’s mortgage loans are collateralized by one-to-four-family residential real estate, have loan-to-value ratios of 80% or less, and are made to borrowers in good credit standing. The Bank usually requires residential mortgage loan borrowers whose loan-to-value is greater than 80% to purchase private mortgage insurance (“PMI”). Management also periodically reviews and monitors the financial viability of its PMI providers.
The Bank originates and retains a limited number of residential mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios that exceed 80% where PMI is not required if the borrower possesses other demonstrable strengths. The loan-to-value ratios on these loans are generally limited to 85% and exceptions must be approved by the Bank’s Chief Credit Officer. Management monitors the balance of one-to-four family residential loans, including home equity loans and committed lines of credit that exceed certain loan to value standards (90% for owner occupied residences, 85% for non-owner occupied residences and one-to-four family construction loans, 75% for developed land and 65% for raw land). These loans are generally paying as agreed.
Premier does not make interest-only, first-mortgage residential loans, nor does it have residential mortgage loan products or other consumer products that allow negative amortization.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill was $317.9 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Core deposit intangibles and other intangible assets decreased to $24.1 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $30.3 million at December 31, 2020, due to the recognition of $6.2 million of amortization. No impairment of goodwill was recorded in 2021 or 2020.
Deposits
Total deposits at December 31, 2021, were $6.28 billion compared to $6.05 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $234.3 million, or 3.9%. Noninterest-bearing checking accounts grew by $127.5 million, interest-bearing checking accounts and money markets grew by $325.0 million, savings increased by $104.0 million and retail certificates of deposit decreased by $32.3 million. Management can utilize the national market for certificates of deposit to supplement its funding needs if necessary. For more details on the deposit balances in general see Note 11 - Deposits to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Borrowings
Premier did not have any FHLB advances or securities sold with agreements to repurchase at December 31, 2021 or 2020. The increase in deposits allowed the Bank to generally not utilize this source of funds in 2021.
Subordinated Debentures
Subordinated debentures were $85.0 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $84.9 million at December 31 2020. In 2020, the Company issued $50.0 million aggregate principal amount fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due in 2030 in a private offering exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These notes carry a fixed rate of 4.00% for five years then a floating rate equal to the three-month SOFR rate plus 388.5 basis points. The Company may, at its option, redeem the notes, in whole or part, from time to time, subject to certain conditions, beginning on September 30, 2025. The net proceeds of the sale were approximately $48.8 million, after deducting the offering expenses.
Equity
Total stockholders’ equity increased $41.2 million to $1.02 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to $0.98 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase in stockholders’ equity was primarily the result of recording net income of $126.1 million partially offset by the payment of $39.0 million of common stock dividends and the repurchase of 967,000 shares of common stock totaling $29.6 million.
Results of Operations
Summary
Premier reported net income of $126.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $63.1 million and $49.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. On a diluted per common share basis, Premier earned $3.39 in 2021, $1.75 in 2020 and $2.48 in 2019. The results for 2020 include eleven months of income and expenses from UCFC compared to twelve in 2021 and none in 2019 as well as $1.01 in Merger-related expense and additional provision cost as a result of the Merger and the adoption of CECL.
Net Interest Income
Premier’s net interest income is determined by its interest rate spread (i.e., the difference between the yields on its interest-earning assets and the rates paid on its interest-bearing liabilities) and the relative amounts of average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.
Net interest income was $227.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $208.0 million and $115.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The tax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.39%, 3.52% and 3.93% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The margin decreased 13 basis points between 2021 and 2020 primarily due to the drop in treasury rates along with the declines in the federal funds rates, impacting asset yields more negatively than deposit costs. Interest-earning asset yields decreased 40 basis points (to 3.63% in 2021 from 4.03% in 2020) but the cost of interest- bearing liabilities between the two periods only decreased 36 basis points (to 0.34% in 2021 from 0.70% in 2020).
Total interest income increased by $5.6 million, or 2.4%, to $243.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $237.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to an increase in securities income offset partly by a decrease in loans income. Interest income from loans decreased to $223.8 million for 2021 compared to $225.1 million in 2020, which represents a decrease of 0.6%. The average balance of loans receivable increased $249.3 million to $5.47 billion for 2021, from $5.22 billion for 2020. However, the average yield on loans decreased 0.22% to 4.09% in 2021 from 4.31% in 2020.
During the same period, the average balance of investment securities increased to $1.14 billion in 2021 from $0.54 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of increasing deposits and decreasing loans. Interest income from investment securities increased to $19.4 million in 2021 compared to $11.5 million in 2020.
Interest expense decreased by $13.7 million to $16.2 million in 2021 compared to $19.9 million 2020. This decrease was mainly due to a 28 basis point decrease in the average cost of funds in 2021 offset by a $0.42 billion increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $0.56 billion to $4.61 billion in 2021, from $40.5 billion in 2020. Interest expense related to interest-bearing deposits was $13.5 million in 2021 compared to $26.9 million in 2020.
Interest expense on FHLB advances was $23,000 in 2021 and $1.7 million in 2020. The decrease in FHLB advance expense was due to lower utilization in 2021 as a result of increased deposits. Interest expense recognized by the Company related to subordinated debentures was $2.7 million in 2021 and $1.3 million in 2020, with the increase primarily due to the recognition of a full year of expense in 2021 compared to a partial year in 2020.
Total interest income increased by $96.9 million, or 68.7%, to $237.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $141.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to loans acquired in the Merger and the impact of acquisition marks and related accretion. Interest income from loans increased to $225.1 million for 2020 compared to $130.9 million in 2019, which represents an increase of 72.0%. The average balance of loans receivable increased $2.6 billion to $5.2 billion at December 31, 2020, up from $2.6 billion at December 31, 2019.
During the same period, the average balance of investment securities increased to $544.6 million in 2020 from $294.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of the Merger. Interest income from investment securities increased to $11.5 million in 2020 compared to $8.2 million in 2019.
Interest expense increased by $4.5 million to $29.9 million in 2020 compared to $25.4 million 2019. This increase was mainly due to a $2.1 billion increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities offset by a 44 basis point decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities in 2020. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $1.9 billion to $4.1 billion at December 31, 2020, up from $2.1 billion at December 31, 2019. Interest expense related to interest-bearing deposits was $26.9 million in 2020 compared to $22.6 million in 2019.
Interest expense on FHLB advances and other interest-bearing funding sources was $1.7 million and $32,000 respectively, in 2020 and $1.4 million and $25,000, respectively in 2019. The increase in FHLB advance expense was due to the Merger. Interest expense recognized by the Company related to subordinated debentures was $1.3 million in 2020 and $1.4 million in 2019.
The following table shows an analysis of net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:
(1)Interest on certain tax exempt loans and tax-exempt securities in 2021, 2020 and 2019 is not taxable for Federal income tax purposes. In order to compare the tax-exempt yields on these assets to taxable yields, the interest earned on these assets is adjusted to a pre-tax equivalent amount based on the marginal corporate federal income tax rate of 21%.
(2)Interest rate spread is the difference in the yield on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.
(3)Net interest margin is net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets excluding average unrealized gains/losses. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures discussion above for further details.
(4)For the purpose of the computation for loans, non-accrual loans are included in the average loans outstanding.
(5)Securities yield = annualized interest income divided by the average balance of securities, excluding average unrealized gains/losses.
See Non-GAAP Financial Measure discussion above for further details.
The following table describes the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest-related assets and liabilities have affected Premier’s tax-equivalent interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (change in volume multiplied by prior year rate), (ii) change in rate (change in rate multiplied by prior year volume), and (iii) total change in rate and volume. The combined effect of changes in both rate and volume has been allocated proportionately to the change due to rate and the change due to volume.
(1)The change in interest rates due to both rate and volume has been allocated between the factors in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each.
Provision for credit losses - Premier’s provision for credit losses was a recovery of $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to an expense $44.3 million for 2020 and $2.9 million for 2019. The increase in provision for 2020 included $25.9 million related to acquisition accounting under CECL for the Merger with the remaining increase generally due to the larger loan portfolio post-Merger and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease for 2021 is primarily due to improved conditions as the economy and credit environment recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Provisions for credit losses are charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for credit losses to a level deemed appropriate by management to absorb anticipated losses over the life of the loan. Factors considered by management include identifiable risk in the portfolios, historical experience, the volume and type of lending conducted by Premier, the amount of non-performing loans, the amount of loans graded by management as substandard, doubtful, or loss, general economic conditions (particularly as they relate to Premier’s market areas) and other factors related to the collectability of Premier’s loan portfolio. See also Allowance for Credit Losses in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Noninterest Income - Noninterest income decreased by $727,000, or 0.9%, to $80.0 million in 2021 primarily due to a decrease in mortgage banking income mostly offset by increases in services fees, security gains and BOLI income. Noninterest income increased by $35.7 million, or 79.5%, in 2020 to $80.7 million up from $45.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to the Merger with 11 months of combined operations in 2020 compared to none in 2019.
Service fees and other charges increased to $24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $21.4 million for 2020 and from $14.0 million in 2019. The increase in service fees and other charges in 2021 is primarily due to higher volumes as a result of the economic recovery. The increase in service fees and other charges in 2020 is primarily due to the Merger.
Noninterest income also includes gains, losses and impairment on investment securities. In 2021, Premier recognized $4.2 million of securities gains compared to $1.6 million in 2020 and $24,000 in 2019.
Mortgage banking income includes gains from the sale of mortgage loans, fees for servicing mortgage loans for others, an offset for amortization of mortgage servicing rights, and adjustments for impairment in the value of mortgage servicing rights. Mortgage banking income totaled $21.9 million, $28.2 million and $9.5 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The $6.3 million decrease in 2021 from 2020 is primarily attributable to a decrease in the gain on sale of loans of $19.9 million offset partly by a $13.8 million positive change in the valuation adjustments on mortgage servicing rights. Premier originated less residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market in 2021 compared with 2020 as long term interest rates stabilized resulting in less refinance activity. The balance of the mortgage servicing right valuation allowance was $2.7 million at the end of 2021.
The $18.7 million increase in mortgage banking income in 2020 from 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in the gain on sale of loans of $20.5 million and a $3.5 million increase in mortgage servicing revenue offset by an increase of $5.7 million in mortgage servicing rights amortization expense and a $7.7 million negative change in the valuation adjustments on mortgage servicing rights. Premier originated more residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market in 2020 compared with 2019 as a result of the
Merger and due to increased refinance activity as long term interest rates fell in 2020. The balance of the mortgage servicing right valuation allowance was $8.5 million at the end of 2020.
Gains on the sale of non-mortgage loans, which include SBA and FSA loans, totaled $0 in 2021 compared to $324,000 in 2020 and $226,000 in 2019. Fluctuations in the volume of eligible SBA loans were the reasons for the difference in income year to year to year.
Insurance commission income decreased to $15.8 million in 2021, down $1.0 million from $16.8 million in 2020 primarily due to lower contingent commissions. Insurance commission income increased to $16.8 million in 2020, up $2.7 million from $14.1 million in 2019 primarily as a result of the Merger.
Income from bank owned life insurance (“BOLI”) increased $1.8 million in 2021 to $5.1 million up from $3.3 million in 2020 primarily due to claim gains. Income in 2019 was $2.2 million.
Wealth income decreased $132,000 to $6.0 million in 2021 from $6.2 million in 2020. Wealth income increased $3.1 million to $6.2 million in 2020 up from $3.1 million in 2019 primarily due to the Merger.
Other noninterest income decreased to $2.8 million in 2021 compared to $3.0 million in 2020. Other noninterest income increased $1.2 million to $3.0 million in 2020 compared to $1.8 million in 2019 primarily due to the Merger.
Noninterest Expense - Total noninterest expense for 2021 was $158.0 million compared to $165.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and $97.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase from 2019 is primarily due to the Merger with 12 months of combined operations in 2021 compared to none in 201. The decrease from 2020 is primarily due to $19.5 million of costs related to the Merger in 2020 mostly offset by increases in compensation and other non-interest expenses.
Compensation and benefits increased $13.4 million, or 17.4%, to $90.6 million in 2021 from $77.2 million in 2020. The increase is mainly related to increased staffing, merit increases and increases in health care. Occupancy expense decreased $819,000, to $15.5 million in 2021 compared to $16.3 million in 2019 and data processing expense decreased $1.3 million to $13.6 million in 2021 from $14.9 million in 2020. Other noninterest expenses increased $1.8 million to $25.1 million in 2021 from $23.3 million in 2020.
Compensation and benefits increased $20.0 million, or 35.1%, to $77.2 million in 2020 up from $57.2 million in 2019. The increase is mainly attributable to an increase in staff from the Merger. Merger costs related to the acquisition and integration of UCFC increased $18.1 million to $19.5 million for 2020 compared to $1.4 million in 2019. The amortization of intangibles increased $5.3 million to $6.4 million at the end of 2020 compared to $1.1 million in 2019 as a result of an increase in intangibles from the Merger. Occupancy expense increased $7.3 million, to $16.3 million in 2020 compared to $9.0 million in 2019, financial institutions tax increased $2.0 million to $4.2 million in 2020 from $2.2 million in 2019 and data processing expense increased $6.8 million to $14.9 million in 2020 from $8.1 million in 2019. The FDIC insurance premium increased to $3.4 million from $484,000 as a result of the Merger and an increase in assets from the (“PPP”) lending program. Other noninterest expenses increased $5.7 million to $23.3 million in 2020 from $17.6 million in 2019.
Income Taxes - Income taxes totaled $30.4 million in 2021 compared to $16.2 million in 2020 and $11.3 million in 2019. The effective tax rates for those years were 19.4%, 20.4%, and 18.6%, respectively. The tax rate is lower than the statutory 21% tax rate for the Company mainly because of investments in tax-exempt securities. The earnings on tax-exempt securities are not subject to federal income tax. See Note 18 - Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial institutions such as Premier generate income primarily through lending and investing activities. The risk of loss from lending and investing activities includes the possibility that losses may occur from the failure of another party to perform according to the terms of the loan or investment agreement. This possibility is known as credit risk.
Lending or investing activities that concentrate assets in a way that exposes the Company to a material loss from any single occurrence or group of occurrences increases credit risk. Diversifying loans and investments to prevent concentrations of risks is one way a financial institution can reduce potential losses due to credit risk. Examples of asset concentrations would include multiple loans made to a single borrower and loans of inappropriate size relative to the total capitalization of the institution. Management believes adherence to its loan and investment policies allows it to control its exposure to concentrations of credit risk at acceptable levels. As of December 31, 2021. Premier’s loan portfolio was concentrated geographically in its northeast, northwest and central Ohio, northeast Indiana, and southeast Michigan market areas. Management has also identified lending for income-generating rental properties within commercial real estate as an industry concentration. Total loans for income-generating rental property totaled $2.0 billion at December 31, 2021, which represents 37.4% of the Company’s loan portfolio. Management believes it has the skill and experience to manage any risks associated with this type of lending. Loans in this category are generally paying as agreed without any unusual or unexpected levels of delinquency. The delinquency rate in this category, which is any loan 30 days or more past due, was 0.01% at December 31, 2021. There are no other industry concentrations that exceed 10% of the Company’s loan portfolio.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company’s primary source of liquidity is its core deposit base, raised through the Bank’s branch network, along with wholesale sources of funding and its capital base. These funds, along with investment securities, provide the ability to meet the needs of depositors while funding new loan demand and existing commitments.
Cash (used in) generated from operating activities was $165.9 million, ($55.6) million and $39.7 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by or used in operations during the periods presented consist primarily of proceeds from the sale of loans (less the origination of loans held for sale), the provision for credit losses, depreciation expense, the origination, amortization and impairment of mortgage servicing rights and increases and decreases in other assets and liabilities. The negative cash from operating activities in 2020 was primarily due to the Company’s decision to originate and sell construction loans held for sale for the first time. Due to the time it takes to complete the construction and sell the loans, the cash used in the origination of loans held for sale greatly exceeded the proceeds from the sale of loans held for sale. Since this is strictly a timing difference, the Company was comfortable paying out dividends on its common stock in 2020 even with the negative cash provided by operating activities.
The primary investing activity of Premier is lending and the purchase of available-for-sale securities, which are funded with cash provided from operating and financing activities, as well as proceeds from payment on existing loans and proceeds from maturities of investment securities. The net cash used for investing activities was $333.5 million, $541.9 million and $225.3 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Principal financing activities include the gathering of deposits, the utilization of FHLB advances, and the sale of securities under agreements to repurchase such securities and borrowings from other banks. The net cash provided by financing activities was $169.9 million, $625.5 million and $218.0 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For additional information about cash flows from Premier’s operating, investing and financing activities, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and related Notes included in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
At December 31, 2021, Premier had the following commitments to fund deposits, borrowing obligations, leases and post-retirement benefits:
To meet its obligations management can adjust the rate of savings certificates to retain deposits in changing interest rate environments; it can sell or securitize mortgage and non-mortgage loans; and it can turn to other sources of financing including FHLB advances, the Federal Reserve, and brokered certificates of deposit. At December 31, 2021, Premier had additional borrowing capacity of $1.4 billion under its agreements with the FHLB.
The Bank is subject to various capital requirements. At December 31, 2021, the Bank had capital ratios that exceeded the standard to be considered “well capitalized.” For additional information about Premier and the Bank’s capital requirements, see Note 17 - Regulatory Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Premier has established various accounting policies that govern the application of GAAP in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements. The significant accounting policies of Premier are described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management, which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management, actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates, which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of Premier.
Allowance for credit losses - Premier believes the allowance for credit losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements. In determining the appropriate estimate for the allowance for credit losses, management considers a number of factors relative to both specific credits in the loan portfolio and macro-economic factors relative to the economy of the U.S. as a whole and the economies of the areas in which the Company does business.
Factors relative to specific credits that are considered include a customer’s payment history, a customer’s recent financial performance, an assessment of the value of collateral held, knowledge of the customer’s character, the financial strength and commitment of any guarantors, the existence of any customer or industry concentrations, changes in a customer’s competitive environment and any other issues that may impact a customer’s ability to meet his obligations.
Economic factors that are considered include levels of unemployment and inflation, GDP growth, Federal Reserve stimulus and broad global and national economic conditions.
In addition to the identification of specific customers who may be potential credit problems, management considers its historical losses, the results of independent loan reviews, an assessment of the adherence to underwriting standards, and other factors in providing for credit losses that have not been specifically classified. Management believes that the level of its allowance for credit losses is sufficient to cover the current expected credit losses. Refer to Allowance for credit losses in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Note 2 - Statement of Accounting Policies for a further description of the Company’s estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for credit losses.
Goodwill and Intangibles - Premier has two reporting units: the Bank and First Insurance. At December 31, 2021, Premier had goodwill of $317.9 million, including $295.6 million in the Bank and $22.3 million in First Insurance. The carrying value of goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if it is determined appropriate. The evaluation for impairment involves comparing the current estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the current estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no additional testing is required and impairment loss is not recorded. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, further valuation procedures are performed and could result in impairment of goodwill being recorded. Further valuation procedures would include allocating the estimated fair value to all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value. If the implied value of goodwill of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
Premier evaluated goodwill as of December 31, 2021 and resulted in no additional testing or impairment. If, for any future period Premier determines that there has been impairment in the carrying value of goodwill balances, Premier will record a charge to earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on net income, but not risk-based capital ratios.
Premier has core deposit and other intangible assets resulting from acquisitions which are subject to amortization. Premier determines the amount of identifiable intangible assets based upon independent core deposit and customer relationship analyses at the time of the acquisition. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. No events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying amount of any identifiable intangible assets may not be recoverable had occurred during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
