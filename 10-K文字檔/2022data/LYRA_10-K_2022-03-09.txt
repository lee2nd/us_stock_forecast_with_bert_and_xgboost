Overview
We are a clinical-stage therapeutics company focused on the development and commercialization of novel integrated drug and delivery solutions for the localized treatment of patients with ear, nose and throat diseases. Our proprietary technology platform, XTreo, is designed to precisely and consistently deliver medicines directly to the affected tissue for sustained periods with a single administration. Our initial product candidates, LYR-210 and LYR-220, are bioresorbable polymeric matrices designed to be administered in a brief, non-invasive, in-office procedure and intended to deliver up to six months of continuous drug therapy to the sinonasal passages for the treatment of CRS. The therapeutic embedded within LYR-210 and LYR-220 is mometasone furoate, which is the active ingredient in various FDA approved drugs and has a well-established efficacy and safety profile. CRS is an inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses which leads to debilitating symptoms and significant morbidities and affects approximately 14 million people in the United States.
We have advanced LYR-210 as a potential preferred alternative to surgery through our Phase 2 randomized, controlled, patient blinded LANTERN clinical trial, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy in CRS patients both with and without nasal polyps who have failed previous medical management but have not undergone endoscopic sinus surgery. The trial was designed to enroll 99 evaluable patients with the potential to increase to up to 150 patients and was initiated in May 2019 at sites in Australia, Austria, Czech Republic, New Zealand, and Poland. In December 2019, the FDA authorized our investigational new drug application, and, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we planned to enroll patients in the United States. However, in light of developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, we discontinued enrollment at 67 patients in our Phase 2 LANTERN clinical trial and did not enroll any patients in the United States.
On December 7, 2020, we reported positive top-line results from our Phase 2 LANTERN clinical trial, including that the 7,500 µg dose of LYR-210 achieved statistically significant improvement in the composite four cardinal symptoms score, or 4CSS, in favor of the treatment arm as measured by the change from baseline at weeks 16, 20, and 24. However, although a strong treatment effect was observed at week 4, LYR-210 did not achieve the primary endpoint of change from baseline in 4CSS at week 4 at either the 7,500 µg dose or 2,500 µg dose relative to the control group. We believe this was due primarily to the discontinuation of enrollment related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the decrease in the number of patients enrolled from planned (99 evaluable) to actually enrolled (67), a greater magnitude of change from baseline in 4CSS at week 4 and/or a smaller standard deviation associated with the change from baseline was required in order to achieve statistical significance for the primary endpoint at week 4. LYR-210 was observed to be safe and well-tolerated at all doses in the trial, and no treatment-related serious adverse events were reported.
In addition, we initiated a separate characterization study in the United States to collect certain PK, data. The PK study was a 56-day open label, multi-center, U.S. study of the PK and safety of LYR-210 in adult subjects with chronic rhinosinusitis. The primary objective of the study was to establish the PK profile of LYR-210. The study enrolled 24 patients, half of whom received LYR-210 2,500 µg and the other half received LYR-210 7,500 µg. The study indicated that both doses were safe and well tolerated, with the Cmax observed with the 7,500 µg dose well below the Cmax established for FDA-approved formulations of MF. MF blood plasma levels observed during the PK study support LYR-210’s ability to deliver consistent and steady dosing over the entire treatment period.
In our Phase 1 clinical trial, LYR-210 met its primary safety endpoint, and we observed that patients generally experienced significant, rapid, clinically meaningful, and durable improvement in SNOT-22 scores, an established patient symptom severity scale, through week 25, which was the end of the trial. Secondary findings from our Phase 1 clinical trial showed that LYR-210 demonstrated significant reduction of sinonasal Type 2 inflammation in surgically-naïve patients with CRS. We believe the reduction of Type 2 inflammation suggests a correlation with rhinologic symptom improvement in CRS and we believe the reduction could be a potential measure of LYR-210’s local anti-inflammatory effects at the site of inflammation in the sinonasal passages.
We initiated our LYR-210 Phase 3 program in January 2022. Our LYR-210 Phase 3 program consists of two pivotal trials - ENLIGHTEN I and ENLIGHTEN II. ENLIGHTEN I is a 52-week, multi-center, randomized, blinded, sham-controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LYR-210 in approximately 180 surgery-naïve CRS patients without nasal polyps or with polyps confined to the middle meatus and have failed prior medical management. The trial consists of three stages - a 2- to 4-week screening and run-in stage, a 24-week treatment stage followed by a 28-week safety extension stage. In the treatment stage, patients are randomized 2:1 to receive LYR-210 (7,500 µg) or sham-procedure. At the end of the treatment stage, patients in the control group receive crossover LYR-210 treatment while patients in the LYR-210 group are re-randomized 1:1 to either receive a crossover sham-procedure or a repeat treatment with LYR-210 (7,500 µg).
ENLIGHTEN II is a 24-week, multi-center, randomized, blinded, sham-controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LYR-210 in approximately 216 surgery-naïve CRS patients without nasal polyps or with polyps confined to the middle meatus and have failed prior medical management. The trial consists of two stages - a 2- to 4-week screening and run-in stage and a 24-week treatment stage. Patients are randomized 2:1 to receive LYR-210 (7,500 µg) or sham-procedure. ENLIGHTEN II is expected to be initiated in the first half of 2022.
The primary endpoint of both ENLIGHTEN I and ENLIGHTEN II is the change CFBL at week 24 in the 3CS score. Secondary endpoints include CFBL in individual cardinal symptoms at week 24, CFBL in CT sinus opacification score at week 24, CFBL in SNOT-22 at week 24, and rescue treatment use through week 24.
We are also developing LYR-220 for use in CRS patients who have an enlarged nasal cavity due to sinus surgery but continue to require treatment to manage CRS symptoms. We initiated the Phase 2 BEACON clinical trial for LYR-220 in November 2021, which will include sites in Australia and the U.S., and will enroll up to 70 CRS patients with prior sinus surgery and will assess the safety, PK, and efficacy of two designs of LYR-220 compared to control. Beyond CRS, we believe our XTreo platform has potential applications in other disease areas, which we are actively exploring to further broaden its therapeutic potential.
We were incorporated as a Delaware corporation on November 21, 2005, and our headquarters is located in Watertown, Massachusetts. Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our Company, business planning, raising capital, developing our technology, building our intellectual property portfolio and conducting research and development activities for our product candidates. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales.
On May 5, 2020, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold 4,025,000 shares of our common stock (including shares issued upon the underwriters’ exercise in full of their option to purchase additional shares of our common stock) at a public offering price of $16.00 per share, par value $0.001, for aggregate gross proceeds of $64.4 million. We received approximately $57.3 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses paid by us. The shares began trading on The Nasdaq Global Market on May 1, 2020. Upon completion of our IPO, all of our outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock converted into 8,335,248 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001.
From inception through December 31, 2021, we have raised an aggregate of $249.1 million to fund our operations, of which $162.1 million were gross proceeds from sales of our redeemable convertible preferred stock, $57.3 million were net proceeds from our IPO, $16.8 million were gross proceeds from government contracts and $12.0 million were gross proceeds from our license and collaboration agreement.
We have incurred significant net operating losses in every year since our inception and expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year and could be substantial. Our net losses were $43.5 million and $22.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $193.4 million. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly as we:
•
conduct additional clinical trials of our most advanced product candidate, LYR-210, including one or more planned pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of LYR-210;
•
conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial of LYR-220;
•
continue to discover and develop additional product candidates;
•
establish manufacturing and supply chain capacity sufficient to provide commercial quantities of any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval;
•
seek regulatory and marketing approvals for product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any;
•
establish a sales, marketing, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval in geographies in which we plan to commercialize our products ourselves;
•
maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•
hire additional staff, including clinical, scientific, technical, regulatory, operational, financial, commercial and support personnel, to execute our business plan; and
•
add clinical, scientific, operational, financial and management information systems and personnel to support our product development and potential future commercialization efforts, and to enable us to operate as a public company.
We do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate. Additionally, we currently use contract research organizations, or CROs, and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to carry out our clinical development activities. We do not yet have a sales organization. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution. Furthermore, we will continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, including strategic collaborations and licensing arrangements. We may, however, be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our current product candidates, or any additional product candidates, if developed.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with therapeutics product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate revenue from product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.
COVID-19 Pandemic and CARES Act
On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization, or WHO, announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China, or the COVID-19 outbreak, and the risks to the international community as the virus subsequently spread globally beyond its point of origin. On March 11, 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the United States and global economies and may affect our operations and those of third parties on which we rely, including by causing disruptions in the supply of our product candidates and the conduct of current and future clinical trials. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may affect the operations of the FDA and other health authorities, which could result in delays of reviews and approvals, including with respect to our product candidates. Additionally, while the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult to assess or predict, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global financial markets may reduce our ability to access capital, which could negatively impact our short-term and long-term liquidity. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change, including the length of time needed to vaccinate a significant segment of the global population and effectiveness of the vaccines with respect to the new variants of the virus. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, financing, or clinical trial activities, or on healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material impact on our liquidity, capital resources, operations, and business and those of the third parties on which we rely.
On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the “Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.” The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations, increased limitations on qualified charitable contributions, and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. We deferred the employer side social security payments. The CARES Act also appropriated funds for the Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program loans that are forgivable in certain situations to promote continued employment, as well as Economic Injury Disaster Loans to provide liquidity to small businesses harmed by the COVID-19 pandemic. On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 was signed into law in order to provide further stimulus and support to those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We did not obtain funding from such loans. We do not believe the CARES Act or the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $45.7 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the fourth quarter of 2022. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be imprecise or incorrect, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. See “-Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our product candidates and any future product candidates, our platform, and technology, and because the extent to which we may enter into collaborations with third parties for development of any of our product candidates is unknown, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and development of our product candidates.
If we raise additional funds through additional collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our product development programs or any future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Financial Operations Overview
Revenue
To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future. To date, we have recognized $0.3 million of collaboration revenue from our LianBio License Agreement.
If our development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval and successful commercialization efforts, or additional collaboration agreements, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales, payments from additional collaboration or license agreements that we may enter into with third parties, or any combination thereof. We cannot predict if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.
We expect that our revenue for the next several years will be derived primarily from our collaboration agreement with LianBio as well as any additional collaborations that we may enter into in the future. We cannot provide assurance as to the timing of future milestone or royalty payments or that we will receive any of these payments at all.
Collaboration Agreement
On May 31, 2021, we entered into the LianBio License Agreement to develop and commercialize LYR-210 in Greater China (mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau), South Korea, Singapore and Thailand. Under the terms of the LianBio License Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $12.0 million and are eligible to receive up to $135.0 million in future payments based upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercialization milestones. Upon commercialization on a region-by-region basis, we will be entitled to receive low double-digit royalties based on net sales of LYR-210 in the licensed territories. LianBio will be responsible for the clinical development and commercialization of LYR-210 in the licensed territories, and we will retain all rights to LYR-210 in all other geographies. As part of the LianBio License Agreement, LianBio will also have the first right to obtain development and commercial rights in the licensed territories to our LYR-220 product candidate.
We assessed this arrangement in accordance with ASC 606 and concluded that the contract counterparty, LianBio, is a customer. At the commencement of the arrangement, we identified the following material promises: (1) license to develop and commercialize LYR-210, (2) manufacturing activities related to the clinical supply of LYR-210, (3) a non-exclusive license to manufacture LYR-210 and obligation to transfer manufacturing technology in the case of a supply failure, and (4) the Company’s performance of the development activities related to the global Phase 3 clinical trial. We determined that the license to develop and commercialize LYR-210, the manufacturing activities related to the clinical supply of LYR-210, and the non-exclusive license to manufacture LYR-210 and obligation to transfer manufacturing technology in the case of a supply failure represent a single performance obligation because of the specialized nature of the LYR-210 manufacturing process whereby the license cannot be separated from the manufacturing activities related to the supply of LYR-210 and the right to manufacture LYR-210 is only available if there is a supply failure. For the purposes of ASC 606, we determined there were two distinct performance obligations: (1) the license to develop and commercialize LYR-210, manufacturing activities related to the clinical supply of LYR-210, and the non-exclusive license to manufacture LYR-210 and obligation to transfer manufacturing technology in the case of a supply failure, and (2) the Company’s performance of the development activities related to the global Phase 3 clinical trial.
Under the LianBio License Agreement, in order to evaluate the transaction price for purposes of ASC 606, we determined that the upfront payment of $12.0 million and the reimbursable cost of the clinical supply of LYR-210 constitute the entirety of the consideration to be included in the transaction price as of the outset of the arrangement, which was allocated to the two performance obligations. The potential milestone payments that we are eligible to receive were excluded from the transaction price, as all milestone amounts were fully constrained based on the probability of achievement.
Additionally, we determined that LianBio’s right of first refusal to obtain development and commercial rights in the licensed territories to LYR-220 is an option as any agreement would be negotiated at arm’s length and as a result does not provide a material right to LianBio and as such, is not considered a performance obligation.
We will recognize the revenue associated with the license to develop and commercialize LYR-210, manufacturing activities related to the clinical supply of LYR-210, and the non-exclusive license to manufacture LYR-210 and obligation to transfer manufacturing technology in the case of a supply failure combined performance obligation as the clinical supply of LYR-210 is delivered. We recognize revenue associated with the development activities related to the global Phase 3 clinical trial performance obligation as the development activities are performed using an input method, according to the costs incurred as to the development activities related to the global Phase 3 clinical trial and the costs expected to be incurred in the future to satisfy the performance obligation. The transfer of control occurs over this time period and, in management’s judgment, is the best measure of progress towards satisfying the performance obligation. The amounts received that have not yet been recognized as revenue are deferred as a contract liability on our consolidated balance sheet and will be recognized as the clinical supply of LYR-210 is delivered and over the remaining time it takes to conduct the global Phase 3 clinical trial, respectively.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses since inception have consisted solely of research and development costs and general and administrative costs.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including the development of and pursuit of regulatory approval of our most advanced product candidate, LYR-210, for the treatment of CRS, which include:
•
employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense for personnel engaged in research and development functions;
•
expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates, including under agreements with CROs, investigative sites, and consultants;
•
costs of manufacturing our product candidates for use in our clinical trials, including fees paid to CMOs as well as other manufacturers that provide components of our product candidates for use in our potential future clinical trials;
•
consulting and professional fees related to research and development activities;
•
costs related to compliance with clinical regulatory requirements; and
•
facility costs and other allocated expenses, which include expenses for rent and maintenance of our facility, utilities, depreciation, and other supplies.
We expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as clinical site activations, patient enrollment, or information provided to us by our vendors and our clinical investigative sites. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and may be reflected in our consolidated financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expenses.
Our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs such as employee compensation, consulting fees, fees paid to CMOs and CRO expenses in connection with our preclinical and clinical development activities. We typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across our development programs and we do not allocate personnel costs and other internal costs to specific product candidates or development programs with the exception of the costs to manufacture our product candidates.
Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future as we initiate additional clinical trials, including two clinical trials for LYR-210 and one clinical trial for LYR-220, scale our manufacturing processes, and continue to discover and develop additional product candidates.
The successful development of LYR-210, LYR-220, and other potential future product candidates is highly uncertain. Accordingly, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing, and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of these product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, we will generate revenue and material net cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. The duration, costs, and timing of preclinical studies, clinical trials, and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including:
•
successful completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability, and efficacy profiles for LYR-210, LYR-220, and any potential future product candidates that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority;
•
approval of an IND for LYR-220 and any potential future product candidate to commence planned or future clinical trials in the United States or foreign countries;
•
significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance;
•
timing and receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•
making arrangements with CMOs for third-party clinical and commercial manufacturing to obtain sufficient supply of our product candidates;
•
obtaining and maintaining patent and other intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates;
•
commercializing the product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;
•
competition with other therapies; and
•
business interruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.
A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development, manufacture, or commercialization enabling activities of any of our product candidates would significantly change the costs, timing, and viability associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in our clinical trials due to patient enrollment or other reasons, we may be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include direct and allocated facility-related costs as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor, and public relations, accounting, auditing, tax services, and insurance costs.
We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support continued research and development activities and potential commercialization of our product candidates. These increases will likely include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and fees to outside consultants, attorneys, and accountants, among other expenses. Additionally, we will continue to incur increased expenses associated with being a public company, including costs of additional personnel, accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance costs, and investor and public relations costs.
Interest Income
Interest income consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements during the reporting periods and estimates used to assess our ability to continue as a going concern. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates.
Going Concern Evaluation and Presentation
We analyze our ability to continue as a going concern in each reporting period, assessing the likelihood that we will be able to fund operations for the twelve months after the filing date of the financial statements. For further information regarding our funding requirements, see Note 1, “Organization and Basis of Presentation - Going Concern,” to our consolidated financial statements. We have concluded and disclosed that there is substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern for a twelve-month period after the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
While there remains substantial doubt of our continuing as a going concern, we are seeking alternative financing sources that provide a reasonable probability that we will be able to maintain our business operations. Therefore, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue from our LianBio License Agreement. To date, revenue from our collaboration agreement has come from initial, upfront consideration allocated to two distinct performance obligations: (1) the license to develop and commercialize LYR-210, manufacturing activities related to the clinical supply of LYR-210, and the non-exclusive license to manufacture LYR-210 and obligation to transfer manufacturing technology in the case of a supply failure, and (2) our performance of the development activities related to the global Phase 3 clinical trial.
Under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration, if any; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it is entitled in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.
Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations. Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer’s discretion are generally considered options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the customer and if so, they are considered performance obligations. The identification of material rights requires judgments related to the determination of the value of the underlying good or service relative to the option exercise price. The exercise of a material right is accounted for as a contract modification for accounting purposes.
We assess whether each promised good or service is distinct for the purpose of identifying the performance obligations in the contract. This assessment involves subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual promised goods or services and whether such are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Promised goods and services are considered distinct provided that: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (that is, the good or service is capable of being distinct) and (ii) the entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (that is, the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract). In assessing whether a promised good or service is distinct, we consider factors such as the research, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. We also consider the intended benefit of the contract in assessing whether a promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. If a promised good or service is not distinct, an entity is required to combine that good or service with other promised goods or services until it identifies a bundle of goods or services that is distinct.
The transaction price is then determined and allocated to the identified performance obligations in proportion to their standalone selling prices, or SSP, on a relative SSP basis. SSP is determined at contract inception and is not updated to reflect changes between contract inception and when the performance obligations are satisfied. Determining the SSP for performance obligations requires significant judgment. In developing the SSP for a performance obligation, we consider applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the agreement with the customer and estimated costs. We validate the SSP for performance obligations by evaluating whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the SSP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple performance obligations.
If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, we estimate the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. We determine the amount of variable consideration by using the expected value method or the most likely amount method. We include the unconstrained amount of estimated variable consideration in the transaction price. The amount included in the transaction price is constrained to the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period of adjustment.
If an arrangement includes development and regulatory milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee’s control, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received.
For arrangements with licenses of intellectual property that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize royalty revenue and sales-based milestones at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied.
In determining the transaction price, we adjust consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments provides us with a significant benefit of financing. We do not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is such that the period between payment by the licensees and the transfer of the promised goods or services to the licensees will be one year or less. We assessed our revenue generating arrangement in order to determine whether a significant financing component exists and concluded that a significant financing component does not exist.
We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied, either at a point in time or over time, and if over time recognition is based on the use of an output or input method.
Accrued Research and Development Expenses
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing purchase orders and open contracts, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule, or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the following costs incurred for services in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced:
•
vendors in connection with preclinical development activities;
•
vendors in connection with the testing of preclinical and clinical trial materials;
•
CROs in connection with preclinical and clinical studies; and
•
investigative sites in connection with clinical trials.
We contract with CROs to conduct clinical and other research and development services on our behalf. We base our expenses related to CROs on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with them. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract, and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our CROs will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or amount of prepaid expense accordingly. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.
Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.
Stock-Based Compensation
We apply the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718, for stock-based awards granted to employees and directors for their services on the board of directors. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock options as of their grant date. We estimate the fair value of each stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Calculating the fair value of stock-based awards requires that we make subjective assumptions.
Pursuant to ASC 718, we measure stock-based awards granted to employees and members of the board of directors at fair value on the date of grant and recognize the corresponding stock-based compensation expense of those awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We have historically granted stock options with exercise prices equivalent to the fair value of our common stock as of the date of grant.
We account for stock-based awards to non-employees in accordance with ASU No. 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, or ASU No. 2018-07, which simplifies the accounting for stock-based payments granted to non-employees for goods and services. Under ASU No. 2018-07, most of the guidance on such payments to non-employees would be aligned with the requirements for stock-based payments granted to employees. Prior to January 1, 2019, we accounted for stock-based payments to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees, or ASC 505-50. Pursuant to ASC 505-50, we measured stock-based awards granted to non-employees at fair value as the awards vested and recognized the resulting value as expense during the period the related services were rendered, which was typically the vesting period. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, we re-measured the unvested portion of these awards using the then-current fair value of our common stock and updated assumption inputs in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
The Black-Scholes option-pricing model uses the following inputs: the fair value of our common stock, the expected volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options, and our expected dividend yield. Following the closing of our IPO, the fair value of our common stock is determined based on the quoted market price of our common stock. We have historically been a private company and lack company-specific historical and implied volatility data. Therefore, we have based our computation of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a representative group of public companies with similar characteristics to us, including stage of product development, life science industry focus, length of trading history, and similar vesting provisions. The historical volatility data is calculated based on a period of time commensurate with the expected term assumption. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available or until circumstances change, such that the identified entities are no longer representative companies. In the latter case, more suitable, similar entities whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation. We use the simplified method as prescribed by the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term for options granted to employees as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. Under this approach, the weighted-average expected option term is presumed to be the average of the contractual term (ten years) and the vesting term (generally four years) of our stock options. We utilize this method due to lack of historical exercise data and the “plain-vanilla” nature of our stock-based awards. The expected term is applied to the stock option grant group as a whole, as we do not expect substantially different exercise or post-vesting termination behavior among our employee population. For options granted to non-employees, we utilize the contractual term of the arrangement as the basis for the expected term assumption. The risk-free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected term of the stock options. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have never paid cash dividends, other than the Special Dividend, and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends on our common stock.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
We have reviewed all recently issued standards and have determined that, other than as disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such standards will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or do not otherwise apply to our operations.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):
Collaboration Revenue
The increase in collaboration revenue was a result of revenue recognized under the LianBio License Agreement.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expense increased by $17.2 million to $29.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to an increase in product development and manufacturing expenses of $7.9 million as we continue to increase our manufacturing capacity and produce our first product at our CMO; an increase in employee related costs of $3.3 million as we increased research and development headcount, including an increase of $0.3 million of stock-based compensation; an increase in clinical expenses of $2.3 million as we completed our separate characterization study to collect additional PK data, completed the final data analysis of our LANTERN clinical trial and prepare for the LYR-210 Phase 3 ENLIGHTEN clinical studies and initiated the LYR-220 Phase 2 BEACON clinical trial; an increase in consulting expenses of $2.2 million; and an increase in depreciation expense of $0.9 million as a result of our investment in manufacturing infrastructure.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expense increased by $4.5 million to $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to an increase in professional and consulting expenses of $1.6 million; an increase in costs associated with being a public company of $1.5 million, in particular an increase in the cost of directors and officers insurance of $0.9 million; and an increase in employee related costs of $1.3 million, including an increase of $0.7 million of stock-based compensation.
Interest Income
Interest income increased $20,000 to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $82,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in interest income was attributable to improved cash management as there were lower average cash and cash equivalent balances and interest rates for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
We have funded our operations from inception through December 31, 2021 primarily with gross proceeds of $162.1 million from sales of our redeemable convertible preferred stock, net proceeds of $57.3 million from our IPO, $16.8 million from government contracts and $12.0 of gross proceeds from our license and collaboration agreement. The following table provides information regarding our total cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):
We currently have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-256020) filed with the SEC on May 11, 2021, or the Form S-3, under which we may offer from time to time in one or more offerings any combination of common and preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units of up to $250.0 million in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2021, we have not sold any securities under the Form S-3.
On May 11, 2021, we entered into an Open Market Sales Agreement, or 2021 ATM Agreement, with Jefferies LLC, or Jefferies, to sell shares of our common stock, from time to time, with aggregate gross sales proceeds of up to $50.0 million, through an at-the-market equity offering program under which Jefferies will act as our sales agent. As of December 31, 2021, we had received no proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to the 2021 ATM Agreement.
Cash Flows
The following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):
Net Cash Used in Operating Activities
The cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in components of working capital.
Net cash used in operating activities was $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in cash used in operating activities of $4.7 million was primarily attributable to increases in cash provided by operating activities resulting from:
•
$12.0 million upfront payment under the LianBio License Agreement;
•
$1.0 million increase in stock-based compensation;
•
$0.9 million increase in depreciation expense; and
•
$3.1 million increase in changes in the components of working capital.
The increase in cash provided by operating activities was offset by a $21.4 million increase in net loss.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in cash used in investing activities of $1.6 million was attributable to an increase in cash used for the purchase of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, primarily for manufacturing our product candidates at our CMO.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $87.7 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities of $87.3 million was primarily attributable to the net proceeds from our IPO and the sale of our Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Funding Requirements
We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the research and development for, begin the manufacturing scale up process for, initiate later stage clinical trials for, and seek marketing approval for, our product candidates. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution. Furthermore, we will continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.
We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the fourth quarter of 2022. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•
the costs of conducting future clinical trials of LYR-210 and LYR-220;
•
the costs of manufacturing additional material for one or more pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of LYR-210 and a Phase 2 clinical trial of LYR-220 as well as potential future clinical studies we might conduct for our other product candidates;
•
the costs of scaling up our manufacturing process and supply chain capacity to provide sufficient quantities of LYR-210 and LYR-220 for the potential commercialization of LYR-210 and LYR-220 if our clinical development program is successful and we obtain marketing approval;
•
the scope, progress, results, and costs of discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing, and clinical trials for other potential product candidates we may develop, if any;
•
the costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;
•
our ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;
•
the achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under any collaboration agreements we might have at such time;
•
the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
•
the amount of revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval;
•
the costs of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications, obtaining, maintaining, and enforcing our intellectual property rights, and defending intellectual property-related claims;
•
our headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our business operations, our research and development activities, and our manufacturing scale up;
•
the costs of operating as a public company; and
•
the cost of potential business interruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and licensing arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interests may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that could adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. We have access to additional funds to be earned in connection with our LianBio License Agreement, if development activities are successful under that agreement. Any debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.
If we raise funds through additional collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, or product candidates, or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Emerging Growth Company Status
The JOBS Act permits an “emerging growth company” such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period under the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of issuers who are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are applicable to public companies, which may make comparison of our financials to those of other public companies more difficult.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, or December 31, 2025, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years.
