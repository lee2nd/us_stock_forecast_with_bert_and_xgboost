Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, and the notes to those financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Report.
Overview
We are a leader in the treatment of life-threatening conditions in the intensive care (“ICU”) and cardiac surgery using blood purification via our proprietary polymer adsorption technology. We have a number of products commercialized and in development based on this technology platform. Our flagship product, CytoSorb®, is already commercialized, and is being investigated to reduce deadly uncontrolled inflammation and dangerous substances in hospitalized patients around the world, with the goal of preventing or treating multiple organ failure, bleeding, and other potentially fatal complications. Organ failure is the cause of nearly half of all deaths in the ICU, with little to improve clinical outcome. CytoSorb, is approved in the European Union (“EU”) as an effective extracorporeal cytokine absorber, designed to reduce the “cytokine storm” or “cytokine release syndrome” that could otherwise cause massive inflammation, organ failure and death in common critical illnesses such as sepsis, burn injury, trauma, lung injury, cytokine release syndrome due to cancer immunotherapy, and pancreatitis. These are conditions where the mortality is extremely high, yet few to no effective treatments exist. In May 2018, we received a label expansion for CytoSorb covering use of the device for the removal of bilirubin and myoglobin in the treatment of liver disease and trauma, respectively. In January 2020, we received CE-Mark label expansion for CytoSorb covering the use of the device for the removal of the anti-platelet agent, ticagrelor, in patients undergoing surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. In April 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) granted Breakthrough Device Designation to CytoSorb for the removal of ticagrelor in a cardiopulmonary bypass circuit during emergent and urgent cardiothoracic surgery. In April 2020, we announced that the U.S. FDA has granted U.S. Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) of CytoSorb for use in critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection and respiratory failure. In May 2020, we received a CE-Mark label expansion for CytoSorb for the removal of rivaroxaban during cardiothoracic surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. In August 2021, the Company announced that it was granted a second Breakthrough Device Designation for its DrugSorb-ATR Antithrombotic Removal System by the FDA to remove the direct oral anticoagulants, rivaroxaban and apixaban. The Company has initiated two U.S. clinical trials evaluating the use of DrugSorb-ATR during cardiothoracic surgery to remove ticagrelor, apixaban and rivaroxaban to prevent or reduce perioperative bleeding complications in pursuit of U.S. FDA marketing approval.
CytoSorb is used during and after cardiac surgery to remove inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, activated complement, and free hemoglobin that can lead to post-operative complications such as acute kidney injury, lung injury, shock, and stroke. We believe CytoSorb has the potential to be used in many other inflammatory conditions, including the treatment of autoimmune disease flares, cytokine release syndrome in cancer immunotherapy, and other applications in cancer, such as cancer cachexia. CytoSorb has been used globally in more than 162,000 human treatments to date in critical illnesses and in cardiac surgery. CytoSorb has received CE-Mark label expansions for the removal of bilirubin (liver disease), myoglobin (trauma) and both ticagrelor and rivaroxaban during cardiothoracic surgery. CytoSorb has also received FDA Emergency Use Authorization in the United States for use in critically-ill COVID-19 patients with imminent or confirmed respiratory failure, in defined circumstances. The EUA will be effective until a declaration is made that the circumstances justifying the EUA have terminated or until revoked by the FDA. CytoSorb has been used globally in more than 7,600 human treatments to date in COVID-19 patients. CytoSorb has also been granted FDA Breakthrough Designation for the removal of ticagrelor in a cardiopulmonary bypass circuit during emergent and urgent cardiothoracic surgery. CytoSorb was also granted a second FDA Breakthrough Device designation for the removal of the Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) apixaban and rivaroxaban in a cardiopulmonary bypass circuit to reduce the likelihood of serious perioperative bleeding during urgent cardiothoracic surgery.
Our purification technologies are based on biocompatible, highly porous polymer beads that can actively remove toxic substances from blood and other bodily fluids by pore capture and surface adsorption. The technology is protected by 21 issued U.S. patents and multiple international patents, with applications pending both in the U.S. and internationally. We have numerous other product candidates under development based upon this unique blood purification technology, including CytoSorb XL, K+ontrol, HemoDefend-RBC, HemoDefend-BGA, ContrastSorb, DrugSorb, DrugSorb-ATR and others.
Our proprietary polymer technologies form the basis of a broad technology portfolio. Some of our products and product candidates include:
● CytoSorb - an extracorporeal hemoperfusion cartridge approved in the EU for cytokine removal, with the goal of reducing SIRS and sepsis and preventing or treating organ failure.
● DrugSorb-ATR - an investigational extracorporeal antithrombotic removal system based on the same polymer technology as CytoSorb that is being evaluated in the U.S. STAR-T and STAR-D pivotal randomized, controlled trial to reduce the antithrombotic drugs, ticagrelor, apixaban and rivaroxaban to reduce bleeding complications in patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery while on these drugs.
● ECOS-300CY - an adsorption cartridge approved in the E.U. for use with ex vivo organ perfusion systems to remove cytokines and other inflammatory mediators in the organ perfusate, with the goal of maintaining or improving solid organ function. In 2021, commercialization of PerSorb™ and Aferetica’s PerLife™ ex vivo organ perfusion system commenced in Italy.
● CytoSorb XL - an intended next generation successor to CytoSorb currently in advanced pre-clinical testing designed to reduce a broad range of cytokines and inflammatory mediators, including lipopolysaccharide endotoxin, from blood.
● VetResQ - a broad spectrum blood purification adsorber designed to help treat deadly inflammation and toxic injury in animals with critical illnesses such as septic shock, toxic shock syndrome, severe systemic inflammation, toxin-mediated diseases, pancreatitis, trauma, liver failure, and drug intoxication. VetResQ is being commercialized in the United States.
● HemoDefend-RBC-a development-stage blood purification technology designed to remove non-infectious contaminants in blood transfusion products, with the goal of reducing transfusion reactions and improving the quality and safety of blood.
● HemoDefend-BGA-a development-stage purification technology that can remove anti-A and anti-B antibodies from plasma and whole blood, to enable “universal plasma,” and safer whole blood transfusions, respectively.
● K+ontrol-a development-stage blood purification technology designed to reduce excessive levels of potassium in the blood that can be fatal in severe hyperkalemia.
● ContrastSorb-a development-stage extracorporeal hemoperfusion cartridge designed to remove IV contrast from the blood of high-risk patients undergoing radiological imaging with contrast, or interventional radiology procedures such as cardiac catheterization and angioplasty. The goal of ContrastSorb is to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy.
● DrugSorb-a development-stage extracorporeal hemoperfusion cartridge designed to remove toxic chemicals from the blood (e.g., drug overdose, high dose regional chemotherapy).
● BetaSorb-a development-stage extracorporeal hemoperfusion cartridge designed to remove mid-molecular weight toxins, such as b2-microglobulin, that standard high-flux dialysis cannot remove effectively. The goal of BetaSorb is to improve the efficacy of dialysis or hemofiltration.
We have been successful in obtaining technology development contracts from governmental agencies such as the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Department of Defense, including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, the U.S. Army, the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Special Operations Command, and others.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Revenues:
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated total revenue, which includes product revenue and grant income, of approximately $43,166,000 as compared to revenues of approximately $41,005,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of approximately $2,161,000, or 5%. Revenue from product sales was approximately $40,109,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to approximately $39,453,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of approximately $656,000 or 2%. Direct sales increased by approximately $361,000 and distributor sales increased by approximately $295,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Sales to hospitals in the United States under the EUA granted by the FDA amounted to approximately $1,690,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to approximately $1,341,000 in 2020. Though difficult to quantify, we estimate that approximately $6.3 million and $9.4 million of total product sales during the
years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was due to the demand for CytoSorb to treat COVID-19 patients. In addition, as a result of the increase in the average exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar, sales were positively impacted by approximately $1,207,000. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the average exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar was $1.18 as compared to an average exchange rate of $1.14 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Cost of Revenue:
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, cost of revenue was approximately $11,047,000 and $11,052,000, respectively, a decrease of approximately $5,000. Product cost of revenues decreased approximately $1,447,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was related to certain costs associated with the rapid ramp-up of production during the year ended December 31, 2020 that did not recur during the year ended December 31, 2021. These decreases were offset by the negative impact of non-recurring costs related to prior years tariffs as a result of an audit by the German Customs Authorities of approximately $732,000 and the offsetting non-recurring positive impact of the Employee Retention Tax Credit of approximately $388,000, both of which were recorded in the first quarter of 2021. Product gross margins were approximately 80% for the year ended December 31, 2021 and approximately 76% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Gross Profit:
Gross profit was approximately $32,118,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $2,166,000 or 7%, over gross profit of $29,952,000 in 2020. This increase is attributed to the reasons discussed above.
Research and Development Expenses:
Our research and development costs were approximately $16,381,000 and $8,811,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of approximately $7,570,000, or 86%. This increase was due to an increase in clinical trial and related costs of approximately $4,670,000, due primarily to the start-up of our STAR-T and STAR-D clinical trials in the U.S. and our PROCYSS and Hep-On-Fire clinical trials in Germany, an increase in salaries related to our clinical trial activities of approximately $1,620,000 due to the hiring of additional clinical expertise, an increase in rent expense of approximately $943,000 related to rent expense on our new facility, an increase in other research and development labor costs of approximately $294,000 related to the hiring of additional scientific expertise and an increase in other research and development costs of approximately $43,000.

This decrease was due to due to a decrease in hiring fees of approximately $319,000, a decrease in legal fees of approximately $263,000, and a decrease in accounting fees of approximately $28,000. These increases were offset by an increase in consulting fees of approximately $294,000 related to certain corporate initiatives.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses:
Our selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $35,750,000 and $28,464,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of approximately $7,286,000, or 26%. This increase is related to an increase in salaries, commissions and related costs of approximately $4,476,000, an increase in non-cash restricted stock expense of approximately $989,000 related to restricted stock units granted to the Company’s executive officers, an increase in non-cash stock option compensation expense of approximately $507,000, an increase in commercial insurance of approximately $280,000, an increase in sales and marketing costs, which include advertising and conference attendance of approximately $1,152,000 and an increase in travel and entertainment costs of approximately $121,000. These increases were offset by a decrease in contracted public relations costs of approximately $210,000 and a decrease in other general and administrative expenses of approximately $29,000.
Interest Expense, Net:
For the year ended December 31, 2021, interest income, net was approximately $28,000, as compared to interest expense, net of approximately $1,201,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease in net interest expense of approximately $1,229,000 was the result of the payoff of our outstanding term loans with Bridge Bank in December of 2020.
Gain (Loss) on Foreign Currency Transactions:
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the loss on foreign currency transactions was approximately $2,578,000, as compared to a gain on foreign currency transactions of approximately $2,607,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The 2021 loss is directly related to the decrease of the exchange rate of the Euro at December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020. The exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar was $1.14 per Euro at December 31, 2021 as compared to $1.22 per Euro at December 31, 2020. The 2020 gain is directly related to the increase in the exchange rate of the Euro at December 31, 2020, as compared to December 31, 2019. The exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar was $1.22 per Euro at December 31, 2019 as compared to $1.12 per Euro at December 31, 2019.
Benefit from Income Taxes:
Our benefit from income taxes was approximately $736,000 and $1,127,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These benefits were realized by utilizing the New Jersey Technology Business Tax Certificate Transfer Program whereby the State of New Jersey allows us to sell a portion of our state net operating losses to a third party.
Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Revenues:
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated total revenue, which includes product revenue and grant income, of approximately $41,005,000 as compared to revenues of approximately $24,949,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of approximately $16,056,000, or 64%. Revenue from product sales was approximately $39,453,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to approximately $22,766,000 in the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of approximately $16,787,000 or 73%. This increase was driven by an increase in direct sales of approximately $8,917,000 resulting from sales to both new customers and repeat orders from existing customers and an increase in distributor sales of approximately $7,769,000. Sales to hospitals in the United States under the EUA granted by the FDA amounted to approximately $1,341,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Though difficult to quantify, we estimate that approximately $9.4 million of total product sales during the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to the demand for CytoSorb to treat COVID-19 patients. In addition, as a result of the increase in the average exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar, sales were positively impacted by approximately $693,000. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the average exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar was $1.14 as compared to an average exchange rate of $1.12 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Cost of Revenue:
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, cost of revenue was approximately $11,052,000 and $7,364,000, respectively, an increase of approximately $3,688,000. Product cost of revenues increased approximately $4,180,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of the increase in product sales. Product gross margins were approximately 76% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and approximately 77% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in gross margin was due to an increase in percent contribution of lower margin distributor sales as well as certain costs associated with the rapid ramp-up of production during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Gross Profit:
Gross profit was approximately $29,952,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of approximately $12,366,000 or 70%, over gross profit of $17,586,000 in 2019. This increase is attributed to an increase in CytoSorb product sales during 2020.
Research and Development Expenses:
Our research and development costs were approximately $8,811,000 and $12,092,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of approximately $3,281,000, or 27%. This decrease was due to a decrease in clinical trial and related costs of approximately $3,769,000, due primarily to the pause in our Company-sponsored clinical trials as a result of hospital restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and a decrease in our non-grant related research and development costs of approximately $393,000. These decreases were offset by an increase in non-clinical research and development salary related costs of approximately $160,000 due primarily to COVID-19 related incentive pay, decreases in direct labor and other costs being deployed toward grant-funded activities of approximately $675,000, which had the effect of increasing the amount of our non-reimbursable research and development costs and an increase in new product development costs of approximately $46,000.
Legal, Financial and Other Consulting Expenses:
Our legal, financial and other consulting costs were approximately $3,048,000 and $2,462,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of approximately $586,000, or 24%. This increase was due to an increase in employment agency fees of approximately $395,000 related to the hiring of senior level personnel, an increase in consulting fees of approximately $219,000 primarily related to certain financial advisory fees and an increase in accounting and auditing fees of approximately $40,000. These increases were offset by a decrease in legal fees of approximately $70,000.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses:
Our selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $28,464,000 and $22,006,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of approximately $6,458,000, or 29%. This increase was due to an increase in salaries, commissions and related costs of approximately $4,849,000 due primarily to headcount additions and increased commissions due to increase sales, an increase in royalty expenses of approximately $1,327,000 due to the increase in product sales, and an increase in non-cash stock option expense of approximately $1,879,000. These increases were offset by reductions in sales and marketing costs, which include advertising and conference attendance of approximately $824,000 and travel and entertainment and other general and administrative expenses of approximately $773,000. These reductions were due primarily to travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Interest Expense, Net:
For the year ended December 31, 2020, interest expense, net was approximately $1,201,000, as compared to interest expense, net of approximately $1,034,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase in net interest expense of approximately $167,000 is related to the final fee that was due upon repayment of our term loans in conjunction with the Third Amendment to the Amended Loan and Security Agreement with Bridge Bank that closed on December 4, 2020.
Gain (Loss) on Foreign Currency Transactions:
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the gain on foreign currency transactions was approximately $2,607,000, as compared to a loss on foreign currency transactions of approximately $350,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The 2020 gain is directly related to the increase of the exchange rate of the Euro at December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019. The exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar was $1.22 per Euro at December 31, 2020 as compared to $1.12 per Euro at December 31, 2019. The 2019 loss is directly related to the decrease in the exchange rate of the Euro at December 31, 2019, as compared to December 31, 2018. The exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar was $1.12 per Euro at December 31, 2019 as compared to $1.15 per Euro at December 31, 2018.
Benefit from Income Taxes:
Our benefit from income taxes was approximately $1,127,000 and $1,092,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These benefits were realized by utilizing the New Jersey Technology Business Tax Certificate Transfer Program whereby the State of New Jersey allows us to sell a portion of our state net operating losses to a third party.
History of Operating Losses
We have experienced substantial operating losses since inception. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $221,185,000, which included losses of approximately $24,559,000, $7,837,000 and $19,266,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Historically, our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in the research and development of our polymer technology, our legal, financial and consulting expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses, which together were approximately $54,863,000, $40,323,000 and $36,560,000 and for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since inception, our operations have been primarily financed through the private and public placement of our debt and equity securities. At December 31, 2021, we had current assets of approximately $64,299,000 including cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on hand of approximately $53,825,000 and had current liabilities of approximately $13,690,000. As of December 31, 2021, $25 million of our total shelf amount was allocated to our ATM facility, all of which is still available. Also, we expect to receive approximately $736,000 in cash from the approved sale of our net operating losses and research and development credits from the State of New Jersey in the first half of 2022.
We believe that we have sufficient cash to fund our operations and clinical trial activities well into the future.
Loan and Security Agreement
The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, CytoSorbents Medical, Inc. (together, the “Borrower”), are parties to that certain Loan and Security Agreement (“Original Agreement”) with Bridge Bank, a division of Western Alliance Bank, (the “Bank”), which was most recently amended on January 19, 2022 (the “Fourth Amendment Date”) under that certain Fourth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the “Fourth Amendment” and the Original Agreement, as so amended, the “Loan Agreement”). Under the Loan Agreement, the Bank has agreed to loan a tranche of term loans in the aggregate amount of $15 million, which are available for the Company to draw down at its sole discretion in three tranches of $5 million each at any time during the period commencing on the Fourth Amendment Date and ending on the earlier of (i) December 31, 2022 and (ii) the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the Loan Agreement) (the “Term C Loan”). For further discussion regarding the Loan Agreement and the Term C Loan, please see Note 7 - Long Term Debt to our Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates have significant effect in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Patents
Legal costs incurred to establish patents are capitalized. When patents are issued, capitalized costs are amortized on the straight-line method over the related patent term. In the event a patent is abandoned, the net book value of the patent is written off.
Revenue Recognition
Product Sales: Revenues from sales of products to both direct and distributor/strategic partner customers are recognized at the time when control passes to the customer, in accordance with the terms of their respective contracts. Recognition of revenue occurs as each performance obligation is completed.
Grant Revenue: Revenue from grant income is based on contractual agreements. Certain agreements provide for reimbursement of costs, other agreements provide for reimbursement of costs and an overhead margin and certain agreements are performance based, where revenue is earned based upon the achievement of milestones outlined in the contract. Revenues are recognized when the associated performance obligation is fulfilled. Costs are recorded as incurred. Amounts invoiced in excess of costs actually incurred on fixed price contracts are classified as deferred revenue and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. Costs subject to reimbursement by these grants have been reflected as costs of revenue.
Research and Development
All research and development costs, payments to laboratories, research consultants and costs related to clinical trials and studies are expensed when incurred.
Stock Based-Compensation
We account for our stock-based compensation under the recognition requirements of accounting standards for accounting for stock-based compensation for employees and directors whereby each option granted is valued at fair market value on the date of grant. Under these accounting standards, the fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
We also follow the guidance of accounting standards for accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring, or in conjunction with selling, goods or services for equity instruments issued to consultants.
Lease Commitments
We currently operate two leased facilities near Princeton, New Jersey and two leased facilities in Berlin, Germany as follows:
● In March 2021, we entered into a lease agreement for a new 48,511 square foot operating facility at 305 College Road East, Princeton, New Jersey, which contains office, laboratory, manufacturing and warehouse space. The lease commenced in April 2021 and expires in March 2037. As of February 2022, our monthly base rent is approximately $111,000.
● Our Deer Park Drive facility consists of approximately 20,820 sq. ft., housing research laboratories and manufacturing operations under a lease agreement which expires on December 31 2022. Our monthly base rent as of February 2022 is approximately $35,300 and additionally we reimburse the landlord for monthly operating expenses of approximately $30,100.
● Our office facility leases in Berlin, Germany require combined base rent payments amounting to approximately $12,100 per month. The initial lease term of both leases ends August 31, 2026. In addition, the Company is obligated to monthly operating expenses of approximately $3,000 per month. Both leases have a five-year option to renew that would extend the lease term to August 31, 2031.
● Our warehouse facility lease in Berlin, Germany commenced on April 1, 2021 and requires monthly payments of base rent of approximately $7,800 and other costs of approximately $240 and has a term of five years. The lease also has an option to extend the lease term for an additional five-year period through March 31, 2031.
