Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
We own and operate CNP Operating, a leading CBD manufacturer vertically integrated with a 360 degree approach to the processing of high quality CBD products designed for growers, pharmaceutical, wellness providers, and retailers’ needs, and a cannabis industry focused sponsored content and marketing business, or the CFN Business. Our ongoing operations currently consist primarily of CNP Operating and the CFN Business and we will continue to pursue strategic transactions and opportunities. We are currently in the process of launching an e-commerce network focused on the sale of general wellness CBD products.
CNP Operating provides toll processing services which includes extraction, distillation, remediation, isolation and chromatography. CNP Operating has a professional, organized and dedicated team with 30 years of combined experience. CNP Operating’s state of the art facility has 30,000 square feet filled with proprietary technology distillation equipment, in house lab testing, distribution warehouse and white labelling product formulation and design.
The CFN Business generates revenue through sponsored content, including articles, press releases, videos, podcasts, advertisements and other media, email advertisements and other marketing campaigns run on behalf of public and private companies in the cannabis industry, helping them reach accredited, retail and institutional investors. Most revenue is generated through contracts involving a monthly cash payment.
The CFN Business’ primary expenses come from advertising on platforms like Twitter and Facebook and from employee salaries and contractor fees. The CFN Business’ content is primarily produced by a team of freelance writers and video content is produced through various vendors. The CFN Business also incurs hosting and development costs associated with maintaining and improving its website, web applications, and mobile applications. The CFN Business operates several media platforms, including CannabisFN.com, the CannabisFN iOS app, the CFN Media YouTube channel, the CFN Media podcast, and other venues. These properties are designed to educate and inform investors interested in the cannabis industry, as well as provide a platform for the clients of the CFN Business to reach investors. The CFN Business distributes content across numerous online platforms, including the CannabisFN.com website, press releases, financial news syndicates, search engines, YouTube, iTunes, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and others.
The CFN Business targets the legal cannabis industry. According to Grand View Research, the global cannabis industry is expected to reach $146.4 billion by 2025, driven by the legalization of medical and adult-use cannabis across a growing number of jurisdictions. According to the Marijuana Index, there are approximately 400 public companies involved in the cannabis industry, which represents the primary target market of the CFN Business. The CFN Business’ services are designed to help private companies prepare to go public and public companies grow their shareholder base through sponsored content and marketing outreach. The success of the CFN Business depends on the legal status of cannabis, investor demand for cannabis investments, and numerous other external factors.
The CFN Business competes with other public relations firms for clients, as well as online publishers for investors. Public relations competition includes investor awareness firms like Stockhouse Publishing, Catalyst Xchange, Stonebridge Partners and Midan Ventures. Online publisher competition includes firms like New Cannabis Ventures, Leafly and High Times. The CFN Business is regulated by rules established by the SEC, FINRA, and certain federal and state cannabis regulations.
Results of Operations
The following are the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020:
Net Revenues
The Company’s revenues are generated from the sale of promotional service packages to customers ranging from 3 to 6 months. The Company offers different packages tailored to the type and stage of the potential customer, such as public companies looking to increase their shareholder base, as well as private companies potentially looking to go public and attract capital and publicity.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the Company realized $684,000 of campaign revenue compared to $497,000 for the same period in the prior year.
The Company’s subsidiary CNP Operating generated revenue of $3.0 million from the sale of products produced from hemp material and manufactured into CBD distillate.
Our revenue for 2021 also included $58,629 relating to sales of product from our e-commerce network focused on the sale of general wellness CBD products. This network was launched during the fourth quarter of 2020 with revenue of $9,000.
Costs of Revenue
The costs of revenue consist primarily of labor, fees paid for production of content for clients and the costs of placement of the content on various platforms. In 2021, the contracts required more production services and related labor than the contracts in 2020. As a result, the cost of revenue in 2021 was higher as a percentage of the revenue recognized during the year.
The Company’s cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 were higher than those in the corresponding year in 2020 due largely to the acquisition of CNP Operating which represented approximately $3.1 million of cost of revenue which primarily represents the cost of hemp material, manufacturing material such as solvent, fuel and equipment depreciation.
Operating Expenses
The Company’s operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were higher than those in the corresponding year in 2020 due largely to the acquisition of CNP Operating which represented approximately $2.6 million of additional general and administrative expenses representing wages. In addition, the Company wrote off goodwill of $9.3 million as an impairment to a long lived asset.
Other income increased during the year ended December 31, 2021, due to the forgiveness of $526,000 for the SBA PPP loan. In addition, the investments received by East West for services were marked to market and resulted in an unrealized loss of $45,658 for the year and a $172,500 loss on extinguishment of debt incurred as it issued common stock in payment of interest payable and extension of the maturity date on a note payable. The Company did not have a similar loss during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
On May 6, 2020, we received $263,000 in the form of a loan from the PPP, as well $150,000 in proceeds from a loan with the SBA on June 24, 2020. We also received a second PPP loan of $263,000 on February 25, 2021. Our plan to continue as a going concern includes raising additional capital in the form of debt or equity, growing the business acquired under the Emerging Growth Agreement and managing and reducing operating and overhead costs. We cannot provide any assurance that unforeseen circumstances that could occur at any time within the next twelve months or thereafter will not increase the need for us to raise additional capital on an immediate basis.
These matters, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
As of December 31, 2021, we had unrestricted cash of $170,015.
Net cash used in operating activities was $344,214 during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $483,522 during the same period in 2020.
Net cash provided by investing activities $22,885 during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with cash provided used in investing activities of 206,634 during the same period in 2020.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $331,243 for the year ended December 31, 2021 was the result of proceeds from a second PPP loan of $263,000, the sale of common stock for $10,000 and the exercise of $50,000 of warrants. In 2020 net cash provided from investing activities related of $763,000 was the result of proceeds from notes payable of $413,000, offset by the payment of preferred stock interest of $45,000.

COVID-19
In March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization, and the outbreak has become increasingly widespread in the United States, including each of the areas in which we operate. While to date we have not been required to stop operating, COVID-19 has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on the financial condition of us and our customers. The outbreak of COVID-19 in the U.S. has had an unfavorable impact on our business operations. Our main customer market suffered its worst decline, decreasing our revenue. Mandatory closures of businesses imposed by the federal, state and local governments to control the spread of the virus is disrupting the operations of our management, business and finance teams. In addition, the COVID-19 outbreak has adversely affected the U.S. economy and financial markets, which may result in a long-term economic downturn that could negatively affect future performance. We took steps to diversify our revenue model by creating our CBD ecommerce business which has higher margins during the second half of 2020 and reduce our costs. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business and our consolidated financial results further will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, but may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Climate Change
Our opinion is that neither climate change, nor governmental regulations related to climate change, have had, or are expected to have, any material effect on our operations.
Critical Accounting Policies
Accounts Receivable
The Company’s account receivables are due from customers relating to contracts to provide investor relation services. Collateral is currently not required. The Company also maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company’s customers to make payments. The Company periodically reviews these estimated allowances, including an analysis of the customers’ payment history and creditworthiness, the age of the trade receivable balances and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to make payments as well as historical collection trends for its customers as a whole. Based on this review, the Company specifically reserves for those accounts deemed uncollectible or likely to become uncollectible. When receivables are determined to be uncollectible, principal amounts of such receivables outstanding are deducted from the allowance. The allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 amounted to $337,192 and $183,750, respectively.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 606, the core principle of which is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, five basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
Subsequent to the closing of the Emerging Growth Agreement on June 20, 2019, the Company’s revenue is generated from the sale of promotional service packages to its customers ranging from 3 to 6 months. The Company offers different packages tailored to the type and stage of the potential customer, such as public companies looking to increase their shareholder base, as well as private companies potentially looking to go public and attract capital and publicity. The services provided by the Company include advertising, publishing of interviews and articles across its network and featuring of client content on its newsletters and social media. The packages all have fixed prices that are billed monthly over the terms of the agreement in even amounts. The Company recognizes revenue for its performance obligation associated with its contracts with customers over time as work is performed, which is deemed to occur evenly throughout the duration of the contract. This also reflects the pattern in which costs are incurred on performing the contracts. To the extent revenue recognized on contracts at each period end exceeds collections, the amounts are reflected as accounts receivable. To the extent collections on contracts at each period end exceeds revenue recognized, the amounts are reflected as deferred revenue.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized, but no less than quarterly.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of five years. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Significant renewals and betterments are capitalized.
Goodwill
The Company’s goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over tangible and intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed arising from business acquisitions. Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis at the reporting unit level. There was an impairment charge of $9,355,657 during the year ended December 31, 2021 related to the impairment of goodwill acquired from the CNP Operating Agreement.
Investment
On December 24, 2020, the Company acquired a 9.8% interest in the outstanding stock of a privately held company. As the stock has no readily determinable fair value, the Company accounts for this stock received using the cost method, less adjustments for impairment. At each reporting period, management reviews the status of the investment to determine if any indicators of impairment have occurred. There were no impairment charges recorded related to investments during the year ended December 31, 2021 or 2020.
Long-Lived Assets
In accordance with ASC 360-10, the Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be recoverable. When such factors and circumstances exist, the Company compares the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amount. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value, based on market value when available, or discounted expected cash flows, of those assets and is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. There was an impairment charge of $9,355,657 during the year ended December 31, 2021 related to the impairment of marketing-related intangible assets acquired from the CNP Operating acquisition.
Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing income available to stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during the period. Dilutive common share equivalents consist of shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options, warrants and preferred stock (calculated using the modified-treasury stock method). As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 210,667 outstanding stock options and 311,112 outstanding warrants and 3,500 preferred stock which were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their effects were anti-dilutive. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 210,667 outstanding stock options, 350,463 outstanding warrants and 3,500 preferred stock which were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their effects were anti-dilutive. As a result, the basic and diluted earnings per share are the same for each of the periods presented.
Share-Based Payment
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this topic, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period.
The Company has elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of its options, which incorporates various subjective assumptions including volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life, and dividend yield to calculate the fair value of stock option awards. Compensation expense recognized in the statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and reflects estimated forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
Common stock awards
The Company has granted common stock awards to non-employees in exchange for services provided. The Company measures the fair value of these awards using the fair value of the services provided or the fair value of the awards granted. The fair value of the awards is recognized on a straight-line basis as services are rendered. The share-based payments related to common stock awards for the settlement of services provided by non-employees is recorded on the consolidated statement of comprehensive loss in the same manner and charged to the same account as if such settlements had been made in cash.
Warrants
In connection with certain financing, consulting and collaboration arrangements, the Company has issued warrants to purchase shares of its common stock. The outstanding warrants are standalone instruments that are not puttable or mandatorily redeemable by the holder and are classified as equity awards. The Company measures the fair value of the awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model as of the measurement date. Warrants are recorded at fair value as expense over the requisite service period or at the date of issuance, if there is not a service period.
