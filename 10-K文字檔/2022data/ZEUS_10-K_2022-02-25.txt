ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our financial statements and the notes thereto, which appears elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Overview
We are a leading metals service center that operates in three reportable segments; specialty metals flat products, carbon flat products, and tubular and pipe products. We provide metals processing and distribution services for a wide range of customers. Our specialty metals flat products segment’s focus is on the direct sale and distribution of processed aluminum and stainless flat-rolled sheet and coil products, flat bar products, prime tin mill products and fabricated parts. Through the acquisition of Shaw Stainless & Alloy, Inc., or Shaw, on October 1, 2021 and Action Stainless & Alloys, Inc., or Action Stainless, on December 14, 2020, our specialty metals flat products segment expanded its geographic footprint and enhanced its product offerings in stainless steel and aluminum plate, sheet, angles, rounds, flat bar, tubing and pipe. Action Stainless offers a range of processing, including plasma, laser and waterjet cutting and machining. Our carbon flat products segment’s focus is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon and coated flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate products and fabricated parts. Through the acquisitions of McCullough Industries, or McCullough, and the EZ Dumper® hydraulic dump inserts, or EZ Dumper, in 2019, our carbon flat products segment expanded its product offerings to include self-dumping metal hoppers and carbon and stainless-steel dump inserts for pickup truck and service truck beds. On September 17, 2021, the Company sold substantially all of the assets related to its Detroit operation. The Detroit operation was primarily focused on the distribution of carbon flat-rolled steel to domestic automotive manufacturers and their suppliers and primarily included in the carbon flat-rolled segment. In addition, we distribute metal tubing, pipe, bar, valves and fittings and fabricate pressure parts supplied to various industrial markets through our tubular and pipe products segment. Products that require more value-added processing generally have a higher gross profit. Accordingly, our overall gross profit is affected by, among other things, product mix, the amount of processing performed, the demand for and availability of metals, and volatility in selling prices and material purchase costs. We also perform toll processing of customer-owned metals. We sell certain products internationally, primarily in Canada and Mexico. International sales are immaterial to our consolidated financial results and to the individual segments’ results.
Our results of operations are affected by numerous external factors including, but not limited to: general and global business, economic, financial, banking and political conditions; fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar to foreign currencies, competition; metals pricing, demand and availability; transportation and energy costs; pricing and availability of raw materials used in the production of metals; global supply, the level of metals imported into the United States, tariffs, and inventory held in the supply chain; the availability, and increased costs of labor; customers’ ability to manage their credit line availability; and layoffs or work stoppages by our own, our suppliers’ or our customers’ personnel. The metals industry also continues to be affected by the global consolidation of our suppliers, competitors and end-use customers.
Like other metals service centers, we maintain substantial inventories of metals to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase metals in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon customer forecasts, historic buying practices, supply agreements with customers and market conditions. Our commitments to purchase metals are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders. From time to time, we have entered into nickel swaps at the request of our customers in order to mitigate our customers’ risk of volatility in the price of metals, and we have entered into metals hedges to mitigate our risk of volatility in the price of metals. We have no long-term, fixed-price metals purchase contracts. When metals prices decline, customer demands for lower prices and our competitors’ responses to those demands could result in lower sale prices and, consequently, lower gross profits and earnings as we use existing metals inventory. When metals prices increase, competitive conditions will influence how much of the price increase we can pass on to our customers. To the extent we are unable to pass on future price increases in our raw materials to our customers, the net sales and gross profits of our business could be adversely affected.
Reportable Segments
We operate in three reportable segments: specialty metals flat products, carbon flat products and tubular and pipe products. The specialty metals flat products segment and the carbon flat products segment are at times consolidated and referred to as the flat products segment. Some of the flat products segments’ assets and resources are shared by the specialty metals and carbon flat products segments and both segments’ products are stored in the shared facilities and, in some locations, processed on shared equipment. As such, total assets and capital expenditures are reported in the aggregate for the flat products segments. Due to the shared assets and resources, certain of the flat products segment expenses are allocated between the specialty metals flat products segment and the carbon flat products segment based upon an established allocation methodology.
We follow the accounting guidance that requires the utilization of a “management approach” to define and report the financial results of operating segments. The management approach defines operating segments along the lines used by the chief operating decision maker, or CODM, to assess performance and make operating and resource allocation decisions. Our CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources based primarily on operating income. Our operating segments are based primarily on internal management reporting.
Due to the nature of the products sold in each segment, there are significant differences in the segments’ average selling price and the cost of materials sold. The tubular and pipe products segment generally has the highest average selling price among the three segments followed by the specialty metals flat products and carbon flat products segments. Due to the nature of the tubular and pipe products, we do not report tons sold or per ton information. Gross profit per ton is generally higher in the specialty metals flat products segment than the carbon flat products segment. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales is generally highest in the tubular and pipe products segment, followed by the carbon and specialty metals flat products segments. Due to the differences in average selling prices, gross profit and gross profit percentage among the segments, a change in the mix of sales could impact total net sales, gross profit, and gross profit percentage. In addition, certain inventory in the tubular and pipe products segment is valued under the last-in, first-out, or LIFO, method. Adjustments to the LIFO inventory value are recorded to cost of materials sold and may impact the gross margin and gross margin percentage at the consolidated Company and tubular and pipe products segment levels.
Specialty metals flat products
The primary focus of our specialty metals flat products segment is on the direct sale and distribution of processed stainless and aluminum flat-rolled sheet and coil products, flat bar products and fabricated parts. Through the acquisition of Shaw on October 1, 2021 and Action Stainless on December 14, 2020, our specialty metals flat products segment expanded its geographic footprint and enhanced its product offerings in stainless steel and aluminum plate, sheet, angles, rounds, flat bar, tubing and pipe. Through the acquisition of Berlin Metals, LLC, or Berlin Metals, on April 2, 2018, our specialty metals flat products segment expanded its product offerings to include differing types of stainless flat-rolled sheet and coil and prime tin mill products. We act as an intermediary between metals producers and manufacturers that require processed metals for their operations. We serve customers in various industries, including manufacturers of food service and commercial appliances, agriculture equipment, transportation and automotive equipment. We distribute these products primarily through a direct sales force.
Carbon flat products
The primary focus of our carbon flat products segment is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon and coated flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate products and fabricated parts. We act as an intermediary between metals producers and manufacturers that require processed metals for their operations. We serve customers in most metals consuming industries, including manufacturers and fabricators of transportation and material handling equipment, construction and farm machinery, storage tanks, environmental and energy generation equipment, automobiles, military vehicles and equipment, as well as general and plate fabricators and metals service centers. We distribute these products primarily through a direct sales force.
Combined, the carbon and specialty metals flat products segments have 33 strategically-located processing and distribution facilities in the United States and one in Monterrey, Mexico. Many of our facilities service both the carbon and the specialty metals flat products segments, and certain assets and resources are shared by the segments. Our geographic footprint allows us to focus on regional customers and larger national and multi-national accounts, primarily located throughout the midwestern, eastern and southern United States.
Tubular and pipe products
The tubular and pipe products segment consists of the Chicago Tube and Iron, or CTI, business, acquired in 2011. Through our tubular and pipe products segment, we distribute metal tubing, pipe, bar, valve and fittings and fabricate pressure parts supplied to various industrial markets. Founded in 1914, CTI operates from seven locations in the Midwestern and southeastern United States. The tubular and pipe products segment distributes its products primarily through a direct sales force.
Corporate expenses
Corporate expenses are reported as a separate line item for segment reporting purposes. Corporate expenses include the unallocated expenses related to managing the entire Company (i.e., all three segments), including compensation for certain personnel, expenses related to being a publicly traded entity such as board of directors’ expenses, audit expenses, and various other professional fees.
Results of Operations
This section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.
2021 Compared to 2020
Our results of operations are impacted by the market price of metals. Metals prices fluctuate significantly and changes to our net sales, cost of materials sold, gross profit, cost of inventory and profitability, are all impacted by industry metals pricing. Starting in August 2020, metals prices increased significantly and reached record levels during 2021 before beginning to decline in October 2021. The increased industry metals pricing has been caused primarily by disruptions in the domestic and global supply chains; increased raw material pricing; supply shortages, including increased lead times and delivery delays; increased transportations costs; and increased domestic demand as the economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Transactional or “spot” selling prices generally move in tandem with market price changes, while fixed selling prices typically lag and reset quarterly. Similarly, inventory costs (and, therefore, cost of materials sold) tend to move slower than market selling price changes due to mill lead times and inventory turnover impacting the rate of change in average cost. When average selling prices increase, and net sales increase, gross profit and operating expenses as a percentage of net sales will generally decrease. During 2021, our sales volumes were negatively impacted by supply chain disruptions; however, our net sales were positively impacted by the price increases experienced during 2021, in particular for carbon flat products, which increased our profitability during 2021.
Consolidated Operations
The following table sets forth certain consolidated income statement data for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars shown in thousands):
(a) Includes $21,850 of LIFO expense and $1,517 of LIFO income in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
(b) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold.
(c) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold.
Net sales increased $1.1 billion, or 87.4%, to $2.3 billion in 2021 from $1.2 billion in 2020. Specialty metals flat products net sales increased $272.6 million, or 87.0%, to $585.8 million in 2021 compared to $313.2 million in 2020 and were 25.3% of total net sales in 2021 compared to 25.4% of total net sales in 2020. Carbon flat products net sales increased $653.9 million, or 94.7%, in 2021 compared to 2020 and were 58.1% of total net sales in 2021 compared to 55.9% of total net sales in 2020. Tubular and pipe products net sales increased $151.7 million, or 65.7%, to $382.4 million in 2021 compared to $230.7 million in 2020 and were 16.5% of total net sales in 2021 compared to 18.7% of total net sales in 2020. The increase in net sales was due to a 75.0% increase in consolidated average selling prices during 2021 compared to 2020, and a 7.1% increase in consolidated volume. Average selling prices in 2021 were $1,942 per ton, compared to $1,110 per ton in 2020. The increase in the average selling price is a result of the market pricing dynamics discussed above in Results of Operations.
Cost of materials sold increased $823.0 million, or 84.1%, to $1.8 billion in 2021 from $1.0 billion in 2020. During 2021, we recorded LIFO expense of $21.9 million compared to LIFO income of $1.5 million in 2020. The increase in cost of materials sold in 2021 is primarily related to increased metals pricing in 2021 compared to 2020.
As a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) increased to 22.1% in 2021 from 20.7% in 2020. The increase in the gross profit as a percentage of net sales is due to the impact of the rapidly increasing average selling prices discussed above in Results of Operations, while the average costs of inventory did not increase as quickly as the average selling price.
Operating expenses (as defined in footnote (c) in the table above) increased $83.3 million, or 32.7%, to $337.7 million in 2021 from $254.5 million in 2020. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 14.6% in 2021 from 20.6% in 2020. Operating expenses in the specialty metals flat products segment increased $38.3 million, operating expenses in the carbon flat products segment increased $25.7 million, operating expenses in the tubular and pipe products segment increased $13.6 million, and corporate expenses increased $5.7 million. Operating expenses increased during 2021 as a result of increased variable expenses related to increased sales volume, increased labor hours and increased variable performance-based incentive compensation; and inflationary impacts on labor, transportation and other product support costs compared to 2020. In addition, the inclusion of operating expenses related to the December 2020 acquisition of Action Stainless and the October 2021 acquisition of Shaw increased operating expenses in the specialty metals flat products segment by $16.7 million.
Interest and other expense on debt totaled $7.6 million in 2021 compared to $7.4 million in 2020. Our effective borrowing rate, exclusive of deferred financing fees and commitment fees, was 2.5% in 2021 compared to 3.3% in 2020. The decreased effective borrowing rate is due to lower interest rates compared to 2020. Total average borrowings increased $67.4 million, or 35.8%, to $255.8 million in 2021 from $188.4 million in 2020, primarily related to increased working capital needs in 2021.
Income before income taxes totaled $164.8 million, or 7.1% of net sales, compared to loss before income taxes of $6.9 million, or (0.6%) of net sales, in 2020.
An income tax provision of 26.5% was recorded in 2021, compared to an income tax benefit of 19.0% in 2020. The lower rate in 2020 was primarily attributable to the impact of permanently non-deductible items on a pre-tax loss.
Net income in 2021 totaled $121.1 million, or $10.53 per basic share and $10.52 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $5.6 million, or $0.49 per basic and diluted share, in 2020.
Segment Results of Operations
Specialty metals flat products
The following table sets forth certain income statement data for the specialty metals flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data):
(a) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold.
(b) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold.
Tons sold increased 31 thousand tons, or 24.6%, to 158 thousand tons in 2021 from 127 thousand tons in 2020. The increase in tons sold was due to the acquisition of Action Stainless as well as customer demand returning to more normalized levels, compared to suppressed sales in 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Net sales increased $272.6 million, or 87.0%, to $585.8 million in 2021 from $313.2 million in 2020. The increase in sales was due to a 50.1% increase in average selling prices and a 24.6% increase in sales volume during 2021 compared to 2020. Sales volumes in 2020 were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Average selling prices in 2021 increased to $3,712 per ton, compared to $2,472 per ton in 2020. The increase in the year over year average selling price per ton is a result of the increased industry metals pricing discussed above in Results of Operations.
Cost of materials sold increased $175.4 million, or 65.8%, to $441.8 million in 2021 from $266.4 million in 2020. The increase in cost of materials sold was due to the increase in sales volume and increased industry metals pricing discussed above in Results of Operations.
As a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a) in the table above) increased to 24.6% in 2021 from 14.9% in 2020. The average gross profit per ton sold totaled $912 in 2021 compared to $369 in 2020. The increase in the gross profit as a percentage of net sales is due to the impact of the rapidly increasing average selling prices discussed above in Results of Operations, while the average costs of inventory did not increase as quickly as the average selling price.
Operating expenses (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) increased $38.3 million, or 109.1%, to $73.4 million in 2021 from $35.1 million in 2020. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 12.5% of net sales in 2021 from 11.2% in 2020. The increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to the inclusion of operating expenses related to the December 2020 acquisition of Action Stainless and the October 2021 acquisition of Shaw, which accounted for $16.7 million of the operating expense increase; increased variable expenses related to increased sales volume, increased labor hours and increased variable performance-based incentive compensation; and inflationary impacts on labor, transportation and other product support costs.
Operating income for 2021 totaled $70.5 million, or 12.0% of net sales, compared to $11.7 million, or 3.7% of net sales, in 2020.
Carbon flat products
The following table sets forth certain income statement data for the carbon flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data):
(a) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold.
(b) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold.
Tons sold increased 24 thousand tons, or 2.6%, to 921 thousand tons in 2021 from 898 thousand tons in 2020. Toll tons sold increased 5 thousand tons, or 9.3%, to 53 thousand tons in 2021 from 48 thousand tons in 2020. The increase in tons sold is due to customer demand returning to more normalized levels, compared to suppressed sales in 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; however, our ability to ship is still limited due to supply chain disruptions experienced by our customers. In addition, tons sold by the carbon flat products segment was negatively impacted by the sale of our Detroit operation in September 2021 resulting in a decrease of 28 thousand tons, or 24.8%, to 85 thousand tons in 2021 from 112 thousand tons in 2020.
Net sales increased $653.9 million, or 94.7%, to $1.3 billion in 2021 from $690.3 million in 2020. The increase in sales was due to an 89.7% increase in average selling prices and a 2.6% increase in sales volume, partially offset by a lower volume due to the sale of our Detroit operation in September 2021. Average selling prices in 2021 increased 89.7% to $1,459 per ton compared to $769 per ton in 2020.
Cost of materials sold increased $507.8 million, or 92.0%, to $1.1 billion in 2021 from $551.8 million in 2020. The increase in cost of materials sold was due to increased industry metals pricing discussed above in Results of Operations.
As a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a) in the table above) increased to 21.2% in 2021 from 20.1% in 2020. The average gross profit per ton sold increased $155 per ton, or 100.2%, to $309 in 2021 from $154 in 2020.
Operating expenses in 2021 increased $25.7 million, or 17.3%, to $174.5 million from $148.8 million in 2020. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 13.0% in 2021 from 21.6% in 2020. Operating expenses increased as a result of increased variable expenses related to increased sales volume, increased labor hours and increased variable performance-based incentive compensation and inflationary impacts on labor, transportation and other product support costs.
Operating income totaled $110.0 million, or 8.1% of net sales, in 2021 compared to operating loss of $10.3 million, or (1.6%) of net sales, in 2020.
Tubular and pipe products
The following table sets forth certain income statement data for the tubular and pipe products segment for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars shown in thousands).
(a) Includes $21,850 of LIFO expense and $1,517 of LIFO income in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
(b) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold.
(c) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold.
Net sales increased $151.7 million, or 65.7%, to $382.4 million in 2021 from $230.7 million in 2020. The increase in net sales was due to a 30.3% increase in average selling prices and a 27.2% increase in sales volume during 2021. The increase in sales volume is due to customer demand returning to more normalized levels, compared to suppressed sales in 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Cost of materials sold increased $139.7 million, or 86.9%, to $300.6 million in 2021 from $160.9 million in 2020. The increase in cost of materials sold is due to increased metals pricing discussed above in Results of Operations and increased sales volumes. As a result of rapidly increasing prices, during 2021, our tubular and pipe products segment recorded $21.9 million of LIFO expense, compared to $1.5 million of LIFO income recorded in 2020.
As a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) decreased to 21.4% in 2021 compared to 30.3% in 2020. As a percentage of net sales, the LIFO expense recorded in 2021 decreased gross profit by 5.7% compared to the LIFO income recorded in 2020, which increased gross profit by 0.7%.
Operating expenses (as defined in footnote (c) in the table above) increased $13.6 million, or 22.4%, to $74.4 million in 2021 from $60.8 million in 2020. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 19.4% in 2021 compared to 26.3% in 2020. Operating expenses increased as a result of increased variable expenses related to increased sales volume and increased variable performance-based incentive compensation and inflationary impacts on labor, transportation and other product support costs.
Operating income for 2021 totaled $7.4 million, or 1.9% of net sales, compared to $9.0 million, or 3.9% of net sales, in 2020.
Corporate expenses
Corporate expenses increased $5.7 million, or 57.8%, to $15.5 million in 2021 compared to $9.8 million in 2020. Corporate expense increased as a result of increased performance-based incentive compensation offset by the $3.5 million gain, net of expenses, on the sale of our Detroit operation in September 2021.
Liquidity, Capital Resources and Cash Flows
Our principal capital requirements include funding working capital needs, purchasing, upgrading and acquiring processing equipment and facilities, making acquisitions and paying dividends. We use cash generated from operations and borrowings under our asset-based credit facility, or ABL Credit Facility, to fund these requirements.
We believe that funds available under our ABL Credit Facility, together with funds generated from operations, will be sufficient to provide us with the liquidity necessary to fund anticipated working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, our dividend payments and any share repurchases and business acquisitions over at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. In the future, we may as part of our business strategy, acquire and dispose of assets or other companies in the same or complementary lines of business, or enter into or exit strategic alliances and joint ventures. Accordingly, the timing and size of our capital requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise.
2021 Compared to 2020
Operating Activities
During 2021, we used $146.4 million of cash for operations, of which $137.5 million was generated from operating activities and $283.9 million was used for working capital needs. Net cash from operations during 2021 was primarily comprised of net income of $121.1 million and the $21.0 million addback of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense. During 2020, we generated $61.7 million of net cash from operations, of which $14.5 million was generated from operating activities and $47.1 million was generated from working capital. Net cash from operations during 2020 was primarily comprised of the $20.0 million addback of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense to the net loss of $5.6 million.
Working capital at December 31, 2021 totaled $565.1 million, a $289.6 million increase from December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to a $241.9 million increase in inventory (resulting from higher average inventory costs and higher inventory levels in 2021 compared to 2020), and a $131.5 million increase in accounts receivable (resulting primarily from increased sales prices and shipping volumes at the end of 2021 compared to 2020, offset by increased accounts payable and outstanding checks (resulting from increased inventory purchases and higher inventory costs at the end of 2021 compared to 2020) and increased accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities (resulting from increased performance based incentive compensation).
Investing Activities
Net cash used for investing activities was $13.5 million during 2021, compared to $28.1 million during 2020. Investment activities in 2021 included the acquisition of Shaw for $12.1 million and $11.0 million of capital expenditures, primarily attributable to processing equipment at our existing facilities. Net proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of our Detroit operation totaled $9.5 million. Investment activities in 2020 included the acquisition of Action Stainless for $19.5 million and $9.8 million of capital expenditures, primarily attributable to processing equipment at our existing facilities. During 2022, we expect our capital spending to exceed our annual depreciation expense.
Financing Activities
During 2021, $164.1 million of cash was from financing activities, which primarily consisted of $167.2 million of net borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility, offset by $1.3 million of credit facility fees and expenses related to our refinancing and $0.9 million of dividends paid and $0.8 million of principal payments for financing lease obligations. During 2020, $33.7 million of cash was used for financing activities, which primarily consisted of $32.3 million of net repayments under our ABL Credit Facility, and $0.9 million of dividends paid.
In February 2022, our Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.09 per share, which is payable on March 15, 2022 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2022. Our Board previously approved 2021 and 2020 regular quarterly dividends of $0.02 per share, which were paid in March, June, September and December of 2021 and 2020. Dividend distributions in the future are subject to the availability of cash, limitations on cash dividends under our ABL Credit Facility and continuing determination by our Board of Directors that the payment of dividends remains in the best interest of our shareholders.
Stock Repurchase Program
In 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to 550,000 shares of our issued and outstanding common stock, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated stock repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, all or some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. Repurchased shares will be held in our treasury, or canceled and retired as our Board of Directors may determine from time to time. Any repurchases of common stock are subject to the covenants contained in the ABL Credit Facility. Under the ABL Credit Facility, we may repurchase common stock and pay dividends up to $5.0 million in the aggregate during any trailing twelve months without restrictions. Purchases in excess of $5.0 million require us to (i) maintain availability in excess of 20% of the aggregate revolver commitments ($95.0 million at December 31, 2021) or (ii) to maintain availability equal to or greater than 15% of the aggregate revolver commitments ($71.3 million at December 31, 2021) and we must maintain a pro forma ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, minus certain capital expenditures and cash taxes paid to fixed charges of at least 1.00 to 1.00. The timing and amount of any repurchases under the stock repurchase program will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and limitations under the ABL Credit Facility, and repurchases may be discontinued at any time. As of December 31, 2021, 360,212 shares remain authorized for repurchase under the program.
There were no shares repurchased during 2021. During 2020 and 2019, we repurchased 15,000 and 109,505 shares, for an aggregate cost of $0.1 million and $1.5 million, respectively.
At- the-Market Equity Program
On September 3, 2021, we commenced an at-the-market, or ATM, equity program under our shelf registration statement, which allows us to sell and issue up to $50 million in shares of our common stock from time to time. We entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement on September 3, 2021 with KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., or KeyBanc, relating to the issuance and sale of shares of common stock pursuant to the program. KeyBanc is not required to sell any specific amount of securities but will act as our sales agent using commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices, on mutually agreed terms between KeyBanc and us. KeyBanc will be entitled to compensation for shares sold pursuant to the program of 2.0% of the gross proceeds of any shares of common stock sold under the Equity Distribution Agreement. No shares were sold under the ATM program during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.
Debt Arrangements
On June 16, 2021, we entered into a Fourth Amendment to Third Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, which amended and extended our existing ABL Credit Facility. The $475 million ABL Credit Facility consists of: (i) a revolving credit facility of up to $445 million, including a $20 million sub-limit for letters of credit, and (ii) a first in, last out revolving credit facility of up to $30 million. Under the terms of the ABL Credit Facility, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request additional commitments under the revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $200 million to the extent that existing or new lenders agree to provide such additional commitments and add real estate as collateral at our discretion. The ABL Credit Facility matures on June 16, 2026.
The ABL Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties and certain covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; (ii) pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase capital stock or redeem or repurchase subordinated debt; (iii) make investments; (iv) sell assets; (v) enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from restricted subsidiaries to us; (vi) incur or suffer to exist liens securing indebtedness; (vii) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of their assets; and (viii) engage in transactions with affiliates. In addition, the ABL Credit Facility contains a financial covenant which provides that: (i) if any commitments or obligations are outstanding and our availability is less than the greater of $30 million or 10.0% of the aggregate amount of revolver commitments ($47.5 million at December 31, 2021) or 10.0% of the aggregate borrowing base ($47.5 million at December 31, 2021), then we must maintain a ratio of EBITDA minus certain capital expenditures and cash taxes paid to fixed charges of at least 1.00 to 1.00 for the most recent twelve fiscal month period.
We have the option to borrow under its revolver based on the agent’s base rate plus a premium ranging from 0.00% to 0.25% or the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus a premium ranging from 1.25% to 2.75%.
As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with our covenants and had approximately $143.5 million of availability under the ABL Credit Facility.
As of December 31, 2021, $1.6 million of bank financing fees were included in “Prepaid expenses and other” and “Other long-term assets” on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The financing fees are being amortized over the five-year term of the ABL Credit Facility and are included in “Interest and other expense on debt” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).
On January 10, 2019, we entered into a five-year forward starting fixed rate interest rate hedge in order to eliminate the variability of cash interest payments on $75 million of the outstanding LIBOR based borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility. The interest rate hedge fixed the rate at 2.57%.
Contractual and Other Obligations
The following table reflects the material cash requirements for our contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2021. We believe that funds available under our ABL Credit Facility, together with funds generated from operations, will be sufficient to provide us with the liquidity necessary to satisfy these obligations.
(a) See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
(b) Future interest obligations are calculated using the debt balances and interest rates in effect on December 31, 2021.
(c) See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
(d) See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Classification is based on expected settlement dates and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations.
(e) Consists of retirement liabilities and deferred compensation payable in future years.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
An off-balance sheet arrangement is any contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (a) made guarantees, (b) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (c) any obligation under certain derivative instruments or (d) any obligation under a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to a company, or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services within a company.
Other than derivative instruments discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2021, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements.
Effects of Inflation
Inflation generally affects us by increasing the cost of employee wages and benefits, transportation services, processing equipment, purchased metals, energy and borrowings under our credit facility. General inflation, excluding increases in the price of metals and increased labor and distribution expense, has not had a material effect on our financial results during the past three years.
Critical Accounting Estimates
This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an on-going basis, we monitor and evaluate our estimates and assumptions.
We believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level considered appropriate based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that we have identified. Estimations are based upon the application of a historical collection rate to the outstanding accounts receivable balance, which remains fairly level from year to year, and judgments about the probable effects of economic conditions on certain customers, which can fluctuate significantly from year to year. We cannot be certain that the rate of future credit losses will be similar to past experience. We consider all available information when assessing the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses each quarter.
Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets
The ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. The assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible sources of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors. Deferred income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet include, as an offset to the estimated temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts on the consolidated balance sheets, the tax effect of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. If we determine that we will not be able to fully realize a deferred tax asset, we will record a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax asset to its net realizable value. We recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.
Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2019, the Financial Account Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” The objective of this ASU is to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to general principles in ASC 740 and by clarifying and amending existing guidance within U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. ASU 2019-12 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. Different components of the guidance require retrospective, modified retrospective or prospective adoption, and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this ASU during the first quarter of 2021 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326).” which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. The ASU replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with a forward-looking expected credit loss model, which will result in earlier recognition of credit losses. The adoption of this ASU on January 1, 2020 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
