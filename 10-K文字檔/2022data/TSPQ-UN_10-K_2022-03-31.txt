Overview
We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on December 21, 2020 and formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this report as our initial business combination. We are an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, are subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. We intend to effectuate our “initial business combination” using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing.
Results of Operations
We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 and for the period from December 21, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the initial public offering, described below, and since the closing of the initial public offering, the search for a prospective initial business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents held after the initial public offering. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as due diligence expenses.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had net income of $17,203,381, which resulted from a gain on the change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $20,225,521, a change in the fair value of the over-allotment option liability of $99,884, interest income on investments held in the trust account in the amount of $23,976, and a gain on the expiration of the over-allotment liability of $17,404, partially offset by expensed offering costs of $1,323,595, operating and formation costs of $1,666,061 and franchise tax expense of $173,749. The gains on the change in fair value of warrant liabilities was due in large part to the decrease in the public traded price of the public warrants.
For the period from December 21, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020, we had a net loss of $1,000, which resulted entirely from formation costs.
Liquidity, Going Concern and Capital Resources
On March 4, 2021, we consummated an initial public offering of 45,000,000 units generating gross proceeds to the Company of $450,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, we completed the private sale of 7,333,333 private placement warrants to our sponsor at a purchase price of $1.50 per warrant, generating gross proceeds of $11,000,000.
On March 4, 2021, the underwriters notified us of their intention to exercise their over-allotment option. As such, on March 5, 2021, we consummated the sale of an additional 1,393,299 Units, at $10.00 per unit, and the sale of an additional 185,774 private placement warrants, at $1.50 per private placement warrant, generating total gross proceeds of $14,211,651. A total of $13,932,990 of the net proceeds was deposited into a trust account, bringing the aggregate proceeds held in the trust account to $463,932,990.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities was $1,381,087, which was due to non-cash adjustments to net income related to a change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $20,225,521, a change in the fair value of the over-allotment option liability of $99,884, interest income on investments held in the trust account of $23,976, and a gain on the expiration of the over-allotment liability of $17,404, partially offset by net income of $17,091,917, expensed offering costs added back to net income of $1,323,595, and changes in working capital of $458,723.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in investing activities of $463,932,990 was the result of the amount of net proceeds from our initial public offering being deposited to the trust account.
For the year ended December 31, 2021 net cash provided by financing activities of $465,437,231 was comprised of $454,654,330 in proceeds from the issuance of units in our initial public offering net of underwriter’s discount paid, $11,278,661 in proceeds from the issuance of warrants in a private placement to our sponsor, proceeds from the advance from a related party of $922,339 and proceeds from the issuance of a promissory note to our sponsor of $165,058, partially offset by the repayment of advance to a related party of $922,339, payment of $488,260 for offering costs associated with the initial public offering and repayment of the outstanding balance on the promissory note to our sponsor of $172,558.
For the period from December 21, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020 net cash used in operating activities was $0, which was due to changes in working capital of $1,000, fully offset by net loss of $1,000.
As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had cash of $123,154 and $0, respectively, held outside the trust account. We intend to use the funds held outside the trust account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a business combination.
Our liquidity needs prior to the consummation of our initial public offering were satisfied through the proceeds of $25,000 from the sale of our founder shares, and a loan of $300,000 under an unsecured and non-interest bearing promissory note. Subsequent to the consummation of our initial public offering, our liquidity will be satisfied through the net proceeds from the private placement held outside of the trust account and proceeds available to us under the working capital loan with TCW Asset Management Company LLC (“TAMCO”), an affiliate of our sponsor. On January 6, 2022 and February 16, 2022, we drew $300,000 and $200,000, respectively, from the working capital loan with TAMCO. In addition, on March 31, 2022, TAMCO signed a commitment letter (the “Commitment Letter”) pursuant to which TAMCO committed to sustaining us, at a minimum, for a period of one year from March 31, 2022 by providing cash infusions for working capital shortfalls, as necessary.
We will have until March 4, 2023 to complete a business combination, which period can be extended to (i) June 4, 2023 if an agreement in principle or a definitive agreement for a business combination is in place as of March 4, 2023 or (ii) any extended period of time that we may have to consummate a business combination as a result of an amendment to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation. If a business combination is not consummated by March 4, 2023 and an extension has not been effected as described above, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of our company.
We have determined that, solely due to the mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution should a business combination or extension not occur by March 4, 2023, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year after the date that these financial statements are issued. We plan to address this uncertainty through a business combination or extension as discussed above. There is no assurance that our plans to consummate a business combination or extension will be successful. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.
Contractual Obligations
Registration Rights
The holders of the founder shares, private placement warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans (and any Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the private placement warrants) have registration rights to require us to register a sale of any of its securities held by them pursuant to a registration rights agreement. The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of a business combination. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.
Underwriting Agreement
We granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 6,750,000 additional units to cover over-allotments at the initial public offering price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions. On March 5, 2021 the underwriters purchased an additional 1,393,299 units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating additional gross proceeds of $13,932,990 to us.
The underwriters were paid a cash underwriting fee of $0.20 per unit, or $9,278,660 in the aggregate. In addition, $0.35 per unit, or $16,237,655 in the aggregate will be payable to the underwriters for deferred underwriting commissions. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the trust account solely in the event that we complete a business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.
Financial Advisory Agreement
On August 9, 2021, we entered into an agreement with TAMCO, an affiliate of our sponsor, to provide strategic advice and assistance to us in connection with a business combination, including providing assistance in connection with the financing of the business combination. As consideration for the services to be rendered, we have agreed to pay TAMCO (a) a transaction fee equal to 50% of the aggregate merger & acquisition financial advisory fees paid or payable in connection with a business combination, payable at or promptly following the closing of a business combination; and (b) a placement fee equal to 20% of the aggregate placement fees paid or payable in connection with any Private Investment in Public Equity (“PIPE”) financing raised as part of a business combination, payable at or promptly following the closing of a business combination. In addition to such fees, we will reimburse TAMCO for TAMCO’s reasonable, documented and customary out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable legal and other professional fees, expenses and disbursements) incurred in connection with the services to be provided by TAMCO, up to an amount not to exceed $50,000. If we do not complete a business combination within the combination period, neither we nor TAMCO shall have any liability or continuing obligation to the other party except for any fees accrued and expenses incurred by TAMCO. There were no costs accrued under the advisory agreement as of December 31, 2021.
Contingent Warrants
In December 2021, our board of directors approved an amendment to a contract to increase the number of warrants issuable to a person affiliated with us from 100,000 warrants to 600,000 warrants. The warrant issuance is contingent upon our completion of a business combination. Accordingly, no expense has been recorded as of December 31, 2021.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates:
Warrant Liabilities
We account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to our own common stock, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding.
For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The initial fair value of the public warrants was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation approach and the fair value of the private placement warrants was estimated using a Modified Black-Scholes model.
Common stock subject to possible redemption
All of the 46,393,299 shares of Class A common stock sold as part of the units in our initial public offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such shares of Class A common stock in connection with our liquidation, if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with our business combination and in connection with certain amendments to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation. In accordance with SEC and its staff’s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of us require common stock subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Therefore, all Class A common stock has been classified outside of permanent equity.
We recognize changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying value of redeemable common stock to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable common stock are affected by charges against additional paid in capital and accumulated deficit.
Net Income Per Share of Common Stock
Net income (loss) per share of common stock is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The remeasurement of Class A common stock subject to redemption to redemption value is excluded from the earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value. Class B common stock subject to forfeiture is included in the calculation of basic income (loss) per share as of the date that the forfeiture contingency has lapsed. Class B common stock subject to forfeiture is included in the calculation of diluted income (loss) per share as of the beginning of the interim period in which the forfeiture contingency lapsed. We have not considered the effect of the public warrants and private placement warrants to purchase an aggregate of 22,983,540 shares in the calculation of diluted income (loss) per share, since the exercise of the warrants are contingent upon the occurrence of future events.
Recent Accounting Standards
In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (“ASU 2020-06”) to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity’s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity’s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective January 1, 2024 for emerging growth companies and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted beginning on January 1, 2021. We early adopted ASU 2020-06 effective January 1, 2021 using the modified retrospective method of transition. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have a material impact on the financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.
Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements.
