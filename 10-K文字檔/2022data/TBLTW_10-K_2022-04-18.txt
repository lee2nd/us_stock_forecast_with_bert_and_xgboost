Business Overview
Our Company was formed to design, manufacture, and distribute innovative tools and accessories to the building industry. The global tool market industry is a multibillion-dollar business.
ToughBuilt’s business is based on development of innovative and state-of-the-art products, primarily in tools and hardware category, with particular focus on building and construction industry with the ultimate goal of making life easier and more productive for the contractors and workers alike.
Our three major categories contain a total of 11 product lines, consisting of (i) Soft Goods, which includes kneepads, tool bags, pouches and tool belts, (ii) Metal Goods, which consists of sawhorses, tool stands and workbench and (iii) Utility Products, which includes utility knives, aviation snips, shears, lasers and levels. The Company also has several additional categories and product lines in various stages of development.
We are continuing to focus our efforts on increased marketing campaigns, and distribution programs to strengthen the demand for our products globally. Management anticipates that our capital resources will improve and our products gain wider market recognition and acceptance resulting in increased product sales.
As discussed below, while the Company has faced the impacts of COVID-19 and inflation, we have been able to obtain significant revenue growth between fiscal 2020 and 2021 of 77.58%. Notwithstanding, we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception and anticipate incurring additional losses for the foreseeable future until such time, if ever, that we can commercialize our technology currently in development. In their audit report included in this Form 10-K, our auditors have expressed that there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. To fund our operations and grow our business, we will require to fund our capital requirements through the sale of debt or equity securities or other arrangements to fund operations. There can be no assurances that will be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, if at all. If the Company is unable to obtain such additional financing, future operations would need to be scaled back or discontinued. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources; Going Concern
” below and Item 1A. Risk Factors “Going Concern
” and “We will require additional capital in order to achieve commercial success and, if necessary, to finance future losses from operations as we endeavor to build revenue, but we do not have any commitments to obtain such capital and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain adequate capital as and when required.”
Business Developments
We remain committed to expanding our product offerings and market share. The following highlights recent material developments in our business in fiscal 2021:
● On February 17, 2021, we announced that we have grown our business from four stock keeping units (SKUs) to 25 SKUs with Toolstation, a Netherlands based company with over 60 stores in Benelux countries and one of the highly respected single-source suppliers of tools, accessories, and building products for professionals and serious do-it-yourselfers. These include current ranges of ToughBuilt’s steel sawhorse line, soft-sided tool storage, and kneepads and have been slotted for immediate placement in all stores and in Toolstation’s catalog;
● In November 2021, we launched two new product lines, ToughBuilt lasers and levels, and fully integrated with our mobile application, ToughBuilt Connect, allowing professional and DIY builders to quickly measure rooms, seamlessly upload information to a smartphone, and create shareable information with the touch of a button;
● In December 2021, we launched a new product line, the ToughBuilt Workbench, available for purchase across our strategic global partners and buying groups servicing over 14,400 stores worldwide;
● In August 2021, we launched a new product line, the ToughBuilt utility knives;
● In September 2021, we launched ToughBuilt Brazil;
● In 2021, our online sales through Amazon totaled $12 million, an increase from $7 million for fiscal 2020, a 71% increase from 2020 to 2021; and
● Since the beginning of 2021, we have raised a total of $87,266,718.86 in net proceeds in registered equity offerings.
Key factors affecting our performance
As a result of a number of factors, our historical results of operations may not be comparable to our results of operations in future periods, and our results of operations may not be directly comparable from period to period. Set forth below is a brief discussion of the key factors impacting our results of operations.
Seasonality
Our business is a seasonal business as a result of our China-based production. For the first calendar quarter, we are not able to ship our products from China due to the hiatus as a result of their New Year holidays. We typically make up the lost sales from the first calendar quarter in the subsequent quarters.
COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic which continues to spread throughout the United States and the world. We are currently monitoring the outbreak of COVID-19 and the related business and travel restrictions and changes to behavior intended to reduce its spread. All of our Chinese facilities were temporarily closed for a period of time but have been reopened. Depending on the progression of the outbreak, including new variants of the coronavirus, our ability to obtain necessary supplies and ship finished products to customers may be partly or completely disrupted globally. Also, our ability to maintain appropriate labor levels could be disrupted. If the coronavirus, including variants thereof, continues to progress, it could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and cash flow, in addition to the impact on its employees.
Since the beginning of 2020, COVID-19 has become a global pandemic. As a result of the measures implemented by governments around the world, our business operations have been directly affected. In particular, we experienced a significant decline in demand for our licensed products as a result of different priorities for medical treatments emerging, thereby causing a delay of actinic keratosis treatment for most patients. Our revenue was directly affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic starting in mid-March of 2020. From that point on, rising infection rates and the resulting American Academy of Dermatology’s official recommendation to care for patients through remote diagnosis and treatment (telehealth) led to significantly declining patient numbers and widespread, albeit temporary, physician practice closures. Revenue from product sales for the twelve months of 2020 declined by about $7.3 million, or 28.0%, when compared to the same period in 2019. In order to mitigate the risk from COVID-19, we took expedited measures to reduce operating expenses and preserve cash, including headcount reductions, mandatory furloughs, freezing of hiring and discretionary spend, and voluntary salary reductions from the senior leadership. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we focused our sales strategy in the U.S. market on our flagship product Ameluz®
and delayed the targeted re-launch to improve the positioning of our licensed product Xepi®
.
Due to the above management initiatives, lifting of some of the government restrictions and reopening of our customers’ businesses, our revenue recovered quickly since March 2021. As COVID-19 vaccines started to roll-out to the general public in March 2021, we experienced an increase in patients willing to undergo treatment for actinic keratosis. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we again saw a seasonally strong increase in sales. Revenue from product sales was $24.0 million for the year end December 31, 2021, as compared to $18.8 million for year-end December 31, 2020, indicating a revenue recovery from the global COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the speed and fluidity with which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and the emergence of highly contagious variants, we do not yet know the full extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business operations. The ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of such epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis and actions taken to contain or prevent the further spread, including the effectiveness of vaccination and booster vaccination campaigns, among others. Accordingly, we cannot predict the extent to which our business, financial condition and results of operations will be affected. We remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, liquidity and financial flexibility and continue to monitor developments as we deal with the disruptions and uncertainties from a business and financial perspective relating to COVID-19 and variants thereof.
Inflation
Prices of certain commodity products, including raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, trade restrictions and tariffs. Increasing prices in the component materials for the parts of our goods may impact the availability, the quality and the price of our products, as suppliers search for alternatives to existing materials and increase the prices they charge. Our suppliers may also fail to provide consistent quality of product as they may substitute lower cost materials to maintain pricing levels. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may negatively affect our profit margins if the Company is unable to mitigate any inflationary increases through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives. To offset increased prices charged by our manufacturers and increased shipping rates, we increased the prices of our products in 2021.
Supply Chain
We acquire a majority of our products from manufacturers and distributors located in China, India and the Philippines. We do not have any long-term contracts or exclusive agreements with our foreign suppliers that would ensure our ability to acquire the types and quantities of products we desire at acceptable prices and in a timely manner. We utilize a number of techniques to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to our supply chain, including in certain cases the use of other qualified suppliers. We increased our inventory from $8,915,345 at December 31, 2020 to $38,432,012 at December 31, 2021. Due to our increased inventory levels in 2021, the supply chain disruptions in 2021 have not had a material adverse effect on our operations and we do not currently anticipate that any continue supply chain disruptions will have a material adverse effect on our operations for fiscal 2022. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors; Disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business.

Nasdaq
Notification; Reverse Stock Split
As initially disclosed on the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 19, 2021 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), on May 19, 2021, the Company received written notification from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it had failed to comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Minimum Bid Price Requirement”) because the bid price for the Company’s common stock for 30 consecutive business days prior to such date had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing. Nasdaq initially granted the Company 180 calendar days, or until November 15, 2021, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement.
As subsequently reported on a Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 16, 2021, on November 16, 2021, Nasdaq granted the Company an additional 180 calendar days, or until May 16, 2022 (the “Extension Period”), to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement. The extension had no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. If, at any time before May 16, 2022, the bid price of the Company’s common stock closes at or above $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide written notification that the Company has achieved compliance with the Rule. If compliance with the Rule cannot be demonstrated by May 16, 2022, Nasdaq will provide written notification that the Company’s common stock will be delisted. At that time, the Company may appeal Nasdaq’s determination to a Hearings Panel. There can be no assurance that the Company will regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement during the 180-day extension period.
As reported by the Company on a Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 4, 2022, on April 1, 2022, the Company held a virtual Special Meeting of Stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) where the Company’s stockholders voted on and approved an amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, as amended, to effect a reverse stock split of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, by a ratio between 1-for-100 and 1-for-200, at any time prior to December 31, 2022, the implementation and timing of which shall be subject to the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Reverse Stock Split”).
At the Special Meeting, the combined holders of 1,328,750,717 shares of the Company’s voting stock entitled to notice of and to vote at the Special Meeting were represented in person or by proxy, representing approximately 95% of the 1,392,897,556 outstanding voting shares as of the close of business on February 15, 2022 (the “Record Date”), and thereby represented a quorum pursuant to the Nevada Revised Statutes and the Company’s bylaws for the transaction of business at the Special Meeting.
As of the filing date of this Form 10-K, the Board has not determined the Reverse Stock Split ratio is expected to do The Company intends effecting the Reverse Stock Split shortly after filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K at a ratio to be determined by the Board.
Reasons for the Reverse Stock Split
The Board believes that effecting the Reverse Stock Split will increase the price of our common stock which would, among other things, help us to:
·
meet certain listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market;
·
appeal to a broader range of investors to generate greater interest in the Company; and
·
improve perception of our common stock as an investment security.
In order to procure the vote necessary to effect the Reverse Stock Split, on February 15, 2022 we closed a preferred stock financing, in which we issued 2,500 shares of Series F Preferred Stock, with an aggregate stated value of $2,500,000, and 2,500 shares of Series G Preferred Stock, with an aggregate stated value of $2,500,000. The Series F Preferred Stock became convertible into an aggregate of 12,500,000 shares of common stock and the Series G Preferred Stock became convertible into an aggregate of 12,500,000 shares of common stock on the date of issuance. The terms of the Series F Preferred Stock are set forth in a Certificate of Designation governing the Series F Preferred Stock filed with the Nevada Secretary of State and effective on February 15, 2022. The terms of the Series G Preferred Stock are set forth in a Certificate of Designation governing the Series G Preferred Stock filed with the Nevada Secretary of State and effective on February 15, 2022.
Except as set forth in the Certificates of Designation governing the Series F Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock, the shares of Series F Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock do not have any voting rights except with respect to the sole proposal in this Proxy Statement. With respect to the Reverse Stock Split, each share of Series F Preferred Stock is entitled to 3,998 votes on such proposal, and each share of Series G Preferred Stock is entitled to 500,000 votes on such proposal, which is referred to as supermajority voting, provided, that the votes by holders of Series G Preferred Stock will be counted in the same proportion as the aggregate votes cast by the holders of common stock who vote on such proposal at the Special Meeting. Except as set forth in the Certificates of Designation governing the Series F Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock, the holders of Series F Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock are not entitled to vote on any other matter. We had to provide the investors purchasing Series F Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock these negotiated terms, including the supermajority voting, in order to provide necessary financing to the Company to fund its operations and to secure investors committed to voting for the Reverse Stock Split. The shares of Series F Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock are outstanding as of the Record Date for this Special Meeting.
Appeal to a Broader Range of Investors to Generate Greater Investor Interest in the Company
An increase in our stock price may make our common stock more attractive to investors. Brokerage firms may be reluctant to recommend lower-priced securities to their clients. Many institutional investors have policies prohibiting them from holding lower-priced stocks in their portfolios, which reduces the number of potential purchasers of our common stock. Investment funds may also be reluctant to invest in lower-priced stocks. Investors may also be dissuaded from purchasing lower-priced stocks because the brokerage commissions, as a percentage of the total transaction, tend to be higher for such stocks. Moreover, the analysts at many brokerage firms do not monitor the trading activity or otherwise provide coverage of lower-priced stocks. Giving the Board the ability to effect the Reverse Stock Split, and thereby increase the price of our common stock, would give the Board the ability to address these issues if it is deemed necessary.
Improve the Perception of Our Common Stock as an Investment Security
The Board believes that effecting the Reverse Stock Split is one potential means of increasing the share price of our common stock to improve the perception of our common stock as a viable investment security. Lower-priced stocks have a perception in the investment community as being risky and speculative, which may negatively impact not only the price of our common stock, but also our market liquidity.
Certain Risks Associated with the Reverse Stock Split
Even if a reverse stock split is effected, some or all of the expected benefits discussed above may not be realized or maintained. The market price of our common stock will continue to be based, in part, on our performance and other factors unrelated to the number of shares outstanding. The Reverse Stock Split will reduce the number of outstanding shares of our common stock without reducing the number of shares of available but unissued common stock, which will also have the effect of increasing the number of shares of common stock available for issuance. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock may have a dilutive effect on the ownership of existing stockholders. The current economic environment in which we operate, the debt we carry, along with otherwise volatile equity market conditions, could limit our ability to raise new equity capital in the future. See “Risk Factors --
Our shares will be subject to potential delisting if we do not maintain the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, including the $1.00 minimum closing bid requirement”
Results of Operations
The Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2021 compared to the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2020
Revenues
Revenues, net of allowances, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $70,026,324 and $39,433,617, respectively, consisted of metal goods and soft goods sold to customers. Revenues increased in 2021 over 2020 by $30,592,707, or 77.58%, primarily due to wide acceptance of our products in the tools industry and receipt of recurring sales orders for metal goods and soft goods from our existing customers and new customers, and introduction and sale of new soft goods products and electronic goods to our customers. Amazon sales increased from approximately $7 to approximately $12 million.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $50,912,513 and $26,572,722, respectively. Cost of goods sold increased in 2021 over 2020 by $24,339,791, or 91.6%, primarily due to the increase in the cost of steel and plastics polyester needed to manufacture metal goods and soft goods, an increase in labor cost in China, high inflation rates, as well as increased prices in tariffs and shipping rates. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues in 2021 was 72.70%, as compared to cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues in 2020 of 67.39%. We expect to reverse the trend and reduce our cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue as we achieve operational efficiencies in production and work with automated state-of-the-art factories to manufacture our product lines.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses consist of selling, general and administrative expenses, litigation expense, and research and development costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses (the “SG&A Expenses”) for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $51,434,180 and $22,191,041, respectively. SG&A Expenses increased in 2021 over 2020 by $29,243,139, or 131.78%, primarily due to hiring additional employees and engaging additional independent contractors and consultants (e.g., industrial designers, sales, operations and accounting staff, and a human resource team) to grow the Company, of which increased the total number of employees, independent contractors and consultants to 184 as of December 31, 2021. SG&A Expenses in 2021 as a percentage of revenues was 73.47%, as compared 56.27% in 2020. We expect our SG&A Expenses will continue to increase as the Company plans to bring professional management team and staff on Board, expend cash to raise capital for new products development, and acquire a new warehouse/storage facility to expand its operations and maintain finished products inventory on hand.
Research and Development
Research and development costs (the “R&D”) for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $6,980,453 and $5,056,811, respectively. R&D costs increased in 2021 over 2020 by $1,923,642 or 38.04% primarily due to the costs incurred in developing new tools, a ruggedized mobile device, software applications to run on the mobile device related to construction industry, and stock-based compensation expense and bonuses to R&D management team. We expect R&D costs to continue to increase/decrease as the Company embarks on developing new tools for the construction industry, and the attachments for the ruggedized mobile device with new software applications.
Other income (expense)
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized income of $2,661,076 of change in fair value of warrant liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $1,810,712 from a loss on exchange transaction. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized interest expense of $297,931 and $1,150,953, respectively.
Net loss
Due to factors set forth above, we recognized a net loss of $37,525,898 and $17,348,622 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The large net loss is mainly attributable to building our team to meet the demand for current product lines and new product lines in design, as well as a high increase in cost of goods sold prices, as noted above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources; Going Concern
At December 31, 2021, we had $7,472,224 cash on hand and $18,179,933 in accounts receivable, net. Although our sales increased by 77.58% during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, we are continuing to focus our efforts on increased marketing campaigns, and distribution programs to strengthen the demand for our products globally. Management anticipates that our capital resources will improve and our products gain wider market recognition and acceptance resulting in increased product sales.
The Company has incurred substantial operating losses since its inception. As reflected in the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $98.3 million at December 31, 2021, a net loss of approximately $37.5 million, and approximately $66.1 million of net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company anticipates incurring additional losses until such time, if ever, that it will be able to effectively market its products and technology currently in development. As such it is likely that additional financing will be needed by the Company to fund its operations and to develop and commercialize its technology. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company does not currently have sufficient capital to fund its operations from the next 12 months. For the 12 months from issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the subsequent 12 months, the Company intends to fund its capital requirements through the sale of debt or equity securities or other arrangements to fund operations. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise needed capital under acceptable terms, if at all. The sale of additional equity may dilute existing stockholders and newly issued shares may contain senior rights and preferences compared to currently outstanding shares of common stock. Issued debt securities may contain covenants and limit the Company's ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to stockholders. If the Company is unable to obtain such additional financing, future operations would need to be scaled back or discontinued. Due to the uncertainty in the Company's ability to raise capital, management believes that there is substantial doubt in the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements.
The Company has conducted the following public and private offerings in since the beginning of the 2020 fiscal year. The net proceeds of each offering were for working capital purposes:
Registered Direct Offering on Form S-3 (February 2022)

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
See the footnotes to our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, included with this annual report.
Management believes that the following critical accounting policy involves more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:
Warrant liabilities: The Company records warrants that do not meet the criteria for equity treatment as liabilities. Accordingly, the Company classifies such respective warrants at their fair value and adjusts the warrants to fair value in respect of each reporting period. Any significant changes in our stock price, risk-free rates, dividend yield or volatility, could materially affect the fair value of warrant liabilities.
