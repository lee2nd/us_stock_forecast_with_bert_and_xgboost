Overview
SSR Mining is a precious metals mining company with four producing assets located in the United States, Turkey, Canada and Argentina. The Company is primarily engaged in the operation, acquisition, exploration and development of precious metal resource properties located in Turkey and the Americas. The Company produces gold doré as well as copper, silver, lead and zinc concentrates. SSR Mining's diversified asset portfolio is comprised of high-margin, long-life assets located in some of the world's most prolific metal districts.
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the global economy and certain financial markets. Seabee and Puna were placed into care and maintenance near the end of the first quarter of 2020 and restarted operations during the second and third quarters of 2020, respectively. Çöpler and Marigold's operations were uninterrupted during 2020. While the length and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact of any existing variant, continues to remain unknown, all sites have remained operational throughout 2021. The Company continues to restrict non-essential travel, protect the health and safety of its employees and contractors and take necessary steps to reduce the risk of COVID-19 impacting its operations.
On September 16, 2020, the Company completed the business acquisition of Alacer Gold Corp. ("Alacer"). The Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Alacer for total consideration of $2,180 million. The financial information included in the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same periods in 2019, includes the results of the Çöpler operation since September 16, 2020.

(3)Gold equivalent ounces have been established using the average realized metal prices per ounce of precious metals sold in the period and applied to the recovered silver metal content produced by the mines. Zinc and lead production are not included in gold equivalent ounces produced.
Revenue
For the year ended December 31, 2021, revenue increased by $621.1 million, or 72.8%, to $1,474.2 million as compared to $853.1 million the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was mainly due to an increase in gold equivalent ounces sold by 71.4%, partially offset by a 0.6% decrease in average realized gold prices. Changes in sales across the Company's operations were as follows: (i) gold sales at Çöpler increased $402.4 million, (ii) metal sales at Puna increased $123.5 million, (iii) gold sales at Seabee increased $78.6 million and (iv) gold sales at Marigold increased $16.6 million. At Çöpler, gold sales were 195.8% higher in 2021 due to a full year of operations and the results for the year ended December 31, 2020 represent only the results from September 16, 2020 to December 31, 2020, the period for which the Company was entitled to the economic benefits of Çöpler following the Company's acquisition of Alacer. At Seabee and Puna, the increase in revenues in 2021 was due to the impact of the temporary suspensions of operations related to COVID-19 during the year ended December 31, 2020. At Marigold, revenues remained relatively consistent for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
Revenue increased by $246.2 million, or 40.6%, to $853.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $606.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was mainly due to an increase in gold equivalent ounces sold of 12.1% coupled with a 30.0% increase in average realized gold prices. Changes in sales across the Company's operations were as follows: (i) $205.5 million in gold sales at Çöpler, which was acquired in September 16, 2020, (ii) a $94.4 million increase in gold sales at Marigold, (iii) a decrease of $42.9 million in silver sales at Puna and (iv) a decrease of $10.8 million in gold sales at Seabee. At Çöpler, revenue reflects the first period reporting results from Çöpler following the acquisition of Alacer on September 16, 2020. At Marigold, gold sales revenue was 29.9% higher primarily due to a 28.2% increase in the average realized gold price. At Puna, sales revenue was 29.5% lower primarily due to a 38.8% decrease in the volume of silver ounces sold, partially offset by a 30.6% increase in the average realized silver price. At Seabee, sales revenue was 7.4% lower due to a 27.7% decrease in the volume of gold ounces sold, offset partially by a 28.0% increase in the average realized gold price. The lower sales volumes at Seabee and Puna were due to the impact of the temporary suspensions of operations related to COVID-19.
Production costs
Production costs increased by $226.8 million, or 51.0%, to $671.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $444.5 million for the year ended December 31. 2020. The increase was primarily due to an additional $143.3 million in production costs at Çöpler during 2021, a 117.8% increase, reflecting a full year of operations during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to partial year costs recorded in 2020 from September 16, 2020 through December 31, 2020, following the acquisition of Alacer. The remaining increase is due to higher production costs of $25.8 million at Seabee, $55.1 million at Puna and $2.7 million at Marigold. At Seabee and Puna, production costs increased in 2021 as the sites did not shut down or temporarily suspend operations as the result of COVID-19 as had happened in the year ended December 31, 2020. At Marigold, production costs remained relatively consistent for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
Production costs increased by $94.9 million, or 27.1%, to $444.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $349.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in production costs was due to the inclusion of $121.6 million in new production costs from Çöpler and an increase of $24.3 million at Marigold, partially offset by a decrease of $45.0 million at Puna and a decrease of $6.1 million at Seabee. At Çöpler, the production costs were new resulting from the acquisition of Alacer on September 16, 2020. At Marigold, production costs increased primarily due to a higher royalty as a result of more ounces produced at a higher average realized gold price. At Seabee and Puna, production costs decreased primarily due to the impact of the temporary suspensions of operations related to COVID-19 during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization
Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense increased by $118.7 million, or 108.6%, to $228.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $109.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. At Çöpler, the increase of $91.4 million reflected a full year of operations being included in the results for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the period from September 16, 2020 to December 31, 2020, following the acquisition from Alacer. At Seabee and Puna, depreciation, depletion, and amortization increased primarily due to the impact of the temporary suspensions of operations related to COVID-19 during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense increased by $23.6 million, or 27.6%, to $109.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $85.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is mainly due to the inclusion of $33.8 million of depreciation, depletion, and amortization from Çöpler, an increase of $0.2 million at Marigold, partially offset by decreases at Puna and Seabee of $2.4 million and $8.0 million, respectively. At Çöpler, the depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense reflects the addition of Çöpler following the acquisition of Alacer on September 16, 2020, adding additional depreciation, depletion and amortization to 2020. At Seabee and Puna, depreciation, depletion, and amortization decreased primarily due to the impact of the temporary suspensions of operations related to COVID-19 during the year ended December 31, 2020.
General and administrative expense
General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $56.6 million as compared to $33.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to a larger combined organization following the acquisition of Alacer that covers more locations and jurisdictions, partially offset by the decrease in stock-based compensation expense primarily related to mark-to-market adjustments for cash-settled units due to changes in the Company's common share price. Further, the insurance market has hardened in 2021 across almost all insurance policy types and the Company is experiencing increased rates as a result of the pricing change in the market.
General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $33.6 million as compared to $31.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. General and administrative expenses increased mainly due to the acquisition of Alacer, partially offset by a decrease in cash-settled stock-based compensation expense as a result of a smaller increase in the Company's common share price during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Exploration, evaluation and reclamation costs
Exploration, evaluation, and reclamation costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $42.4 million as compared to $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Exploration and evaluation activity in the year ended December 31, 2020 was restricted by COVID-19. The expenditures incurred during the year ended December 31, 2021 mainly relate to brownfield exploration work at Çöpler, particularly around the Saddle target and Ardich, in addition to work at the Trenton Canyon property of Marigold and work at Seabee. The expenditures incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 mainly related to greenfield exploration work performed at the Trenton Canyon property of Marigold and Seabee.

Care and maintenance expenses of $13.6 million and $16.0 million were recognized at Seabee and Puna, respectively. These costs related to expenses incurred with the temporary suspension of the operations in response to COVID-19 during 2020. During the temporary suspensions, certain costs were incurred at each of the sites to provide care and maintenance activities. These costs were identified and recognized as care and maintenance expenses in the consolidated statements of income.
Impairment of long-lived and other assets
Impairment loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $20.3 million and no loss was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Interest expense
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $19.1 million as compared to $13.9 million for the year ended December 2020. The increase is mainly due to the addition of a full year of interest expense incurred in 2021 associated with the Term Loan and the Air Liquide oxygen plant at Çöpler which were assumed as part of the acquisition of Alacer.
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $13.9 million as compared to $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is mainly due to the interest expense for the partial year on the Term Loan assumed in the acquisition of Alacer.
Other income (expense)
Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $14.1 million as compared to income of $31.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change is mainly due to the fluctuation in fair value of marketable securities. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized a loss of $10.7 million and a gain of $21.4 million, respectively.
Other income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $31.1 million as compared to $39.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Foreign exchange gain (loss)
Foreign exchange gain for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $3.6 million compared to a loss of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company's main foreign exchange exposures are related to net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in TRY, ARS and CAD. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the foreign exchange gain was mainly due to a weakening of the TRY against the USD and its impact on TRY-denominated liabilities at Çöpler, partially offset by a weakening of the ARS against the USD and its impact on ARS-denominated assets at Puna.
Foreign exchange loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $3.7 million as compared to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the foreign exchange loss was mainly due to a weakening of the ARS and its impact on the ARS-denominated assets at Puna, offset partially by a foreign exchange gain on CAD-denominated liabilities during the first quarter of 2020, as the CAD weakened, in addition to a foreign exchange gain on cash and cash equivalents balance during the second and third quarters of 2020 as the CAD strengthened. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the foreign exchange loss was due mainly to a weakening of the ARS and its impact on ARS denominated assets at Puna, as well as a strengthening of the CAD and its impact on CAD denominated assets.
Income and mining tax benefit (expense)
Income and mining tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $14.1 million as compared to expense of $43.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in tax expense in the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily a result of a remeasurement gain on non-monetary assets denominated in non-functional currencies, primarily resulting from Turkey. In particular there was a significant devaluation of the Lira relative to the U.S. dollar amounting to $116.8 million.
Income and mining tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $43.2 million as compared to $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily a result of increased income from operations.

Seabee, Canada
(1)The Company reports the non-GAAP financial measures of cash costs and AISC per ounce of gold sold to manage and evaluate operating performance at Seabee. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for an explanation of these financial measures and a reconciliation to production costs, which are the comparable GAAP financial measure.
Production and Production Costs
For the year ended December 31, 2021, Seabee produced 118,888 ounces of gold, a 45.5% increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to a full year of mill operations in 2021 compared to the mill shut down from March 2020 through August 2020 due to the temporary suspension of operations as a result of COVID-19. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Seabee produced 81,686 ounces of gold, a 26.3% decrease compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

Production costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $40.6 million, a 13.0% decrease as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the temporary suspension of operations in 2020.
Cash Costs
Cash costs per ounce of gold sold remained consistent during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020.
Cash costs per ounce of gold sold for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $522 as compared to $447 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash costs was primarily due to a 27.7% decrease in gold ounces sold, partially offset by a 13.0% decrease in production costs.
AISC
For the year ended December 31, 2021, AISC per ounce was $804, a 27.6% decrease compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease is primarily due to a 57.1% increase in gold ounces sold.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, AISC per ounce of gold sold was $1,110, a 39.1% increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to a 27.7% decrease in gold equivalent ounces sold while the AISC costs remained consistent with the prior period.
Puna, Argentina
(1)The Company reports the non-GAAP financial measures of cash costs and AISC per ounce of silver sold to manage and evaluate operating performance at Puna. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for an explanation of these financial measures and a reconciliation to production costs, which are the comparable GAAP financial measure.
(2)Gold equivalent ounces have been established using realized metal prices per ounce of precious metal sold in the period and applied to the recovered metal content of the silver sold by Puna. The Company has not included lead and zinc as they are considered a by-product.
Production
For the year ended December 31, 2021, Puna produced 8.0 million ounces of silver, a 43.5% increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to a full year of production in 2021 as compared to the temporary suspension of operations in response to COVID-19 during the second and third quarters of 2020. Lead and zinc production were significantly higher for the same reason. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Puna produced 5,581.2 million ounces of silver, a 27.3% decrease compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily due to the temporary suspension of operations in response to COVID-19 during the second and third quarters of 2020 and a full year of operations in 2019.
Production costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $121.1 million a 83.5% increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the temporary suspension of operations in 2020. Production costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $66.0 million, a 40.5% decrease as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the temporary suspension of operations in 2020.
Cash Costs
Cash costs per ounce of silver sold for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $10.56, a 17.0% decrease as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease is primarily due to the increased silver ounces produced partially offset by increases in operating costs due to increased productivity of mining equipment and higher average daily plant throughput.
Cash costs per ounce of silver sold for the year ended December 31,2020 were $12.72, a 3.9% increase as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher mining unit costs, offset by lower processing and overhead unit costs. Mining costs were higher due to operating inefficiencies through shutdown and start-up phases and an increase in maintenance work performed during the temporary suspensions. The lower processing and overhead unit costs are a result of higher average daily plant throughput and the positive impact of the renegotiation of the natural gas contract.
AISC
For the year ended December 31, 2021, AISC per ounce of silver sold was $12.40, a 33.2% decrease compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in per ounce cost is primarily due to a significant increase in volumes produced and sold during 2021. Volumes increased in 2021 primarily due to the temporary suspension of operations in response to COVID-19 during the second and third quarters of 2020.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, AISC per ounce of silver sold was $18.56, a 34.4% increase as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to higher cash costs per ounce sold, offset partially by lower sustaining capital expenditures. The lower sustaining capital expenditures were mainly due to the deferral of capital projects due to impacts of COVID-19.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company manages its liquidity risk through a rigorous planning, budgeting and forecasting process, which is reviewed and updated on a regular basis, to help determine the funding requirements to support its current operations, expansion and development plans, and by managing its capital structure.
The Company's objectives when managing capital are to:
▪safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to develop and operate its current projects and pursue strategic growth initiatives; and
▪maintain a flexible capital structure which lowers its cost of capital.
In assessing capital structure, the Company includes the components of shareholders’ equity, the 2019 Notes, the Term Loan and the Amended Credit Facility. In order to facilitate the management of capital requirements, the Company prepares annual budgets and continuously monitors and reviews actual and forecasted cash flows. The annual budget is monitored and approved by the Company's Board of Directors. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may, from time to time, issue new shares or debt, repay debt, dispose of non-core assets, or buy back shares. The Company expects its current capital resources will be sufficient to meet its business requirements for a minimum of twelve months.
Cash Dividends
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.20 per common share in the aggregate amount of $43.2 million.
Share Repurchase Plan/ NCIB
On April 19, 2021, the Board authorized a share repurchase plan, pursuant to which the Company may purchase in open market transactions, from time to time over the 12-month period commencing April 21, 2021, up to an aggregate of 10,000,000 of our common shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the TSX and/or other exchanges and alternative trading systems in Canada and/or the United States, if eligible, subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules. The price that the Company will pay for common shares in open market transactions will be the market price at the time of purchase or such other price as may be permitted by applicable law or stock exchange rules. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company repurchased and cancelled 8,800,700 common shares for $148.1 million under the 2021 Repurchase Plan.
The TSX approved the Company’s notice of intention to commence the NCIB pursuant to which the Company may purchase common shares over the TSX and Nasdaq for the period commencing April 21, 2021 until April 20, 2022 in accordance with the TSX's normal course issuer bid rules, including that such purchases are to be made at prevailing market prices or as otherwise permitted. Under the rules of the TSX, the maximum number of common shares that may be purchased in this period is 10,000,000 (representing 4.5% of the Company’s issued and outstanding common shares as of April 9, 2021), and the maximum number of common shares that may be purchased on a single day on the TSX is 144,221 common shares, which is 25.0% of 576,887 (the average daily trading volume for the common shares on the TSX for the six months ended prior to the TSX's acceptance of the notice of the NCIB), subject to certain exceptions for block purchases, subject in any case to the volume and other limitations under Rule 10b-18. Under the rules of the NASDAQ, the maximum number of common shares that can be purchased on a single day on the Nasdaq is 25.0% of the rolling 4-week average.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
At December 31, 2021, the Company had $1,017.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $156.9 million from December 31, 2020, mainly due to positive cash flows generated at each of the Company's operations. The Company held $975.0 million of its cash and cash equivalents balance in USD. Additionally, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of $24.5 million, $12.8 million and $3.0 million in ARS, CAD and TRY, respectively. All cash is invested in short-term investments or high interest savings accounts in accordance with the Company's investment policy with maturities of 90 days or less, providing the Company with sufficient liquidity to meet its foreseeable corporate needs.
Debt
On June 7, 2021, the Company amended its previous Credit Facility which expired on June 8, 2021, increasing the facility size from $75.0 million to $200.0 million and extending the maturity by four years to June 8, 2025. The Amended Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature that increased from $25.0 million to $100.0 million. The Amended Credit Facility may be used by the Company for working capital, reclamation bonding and other general corporate purposes. Amounts drawn under the Amended Credit Facility are subject to variable interest rates at LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.00% to 3.00%, based on the Company's net leverage ratio. The Amended Credit Facility contains fallback language that replaces LIBOR with an alternative benchmark rate based on either SOFR or another alternative benchmark rate when LIBOR ceases to exist. Undrawn amounts are subject to a standby fee ranging from 0.40% to 0.60%, based on the Company's net leverage ratio. The Amended Credit Facility is undrawn at December 31, 2021.
The Company's working capital at December 31, 2021, together with future cash flows from operations, are expected to be sufficient to fund planned activities and commitments.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes the Company's cash flow activity for year ended December 31:
Cash provided by operating activities
For the year ended December 31, 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $609.0 million compared to $307.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in cash provided by operating activities is mainly due to the impact of higher gold sales across all mine sites including a full year of operations at Çöpler during the year ended December 31, 2021.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $307.1 million compared to $118.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during 2020 was mainly due to the impact of increased gold production due to the acquisition of Alacer, as well as higher average realized gold prices.
Cash (used in) provided by investing activities
For the year ended December 31, 2021, cash used in investing activities was $129.1 million compared to cash provided by investing activities of $240.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in cash used in investing activities is mainly due to increased capital expenditures of $25.8 million and a $85.7 million reduction in proceeds from sales of marketable securities, partially offset from the proceeds of $32.6 million from the royalty portfolio sale in 2021. Furthermore, the Company acquired cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $303.4 million in connection with the acquisition of Alacer during 2020.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by investing activities was $240.4 million compared to cash used in investing activities of $114.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash provided is mainly due to the acquisition of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on the acquisition of Alacer on September 16, 2021 and higher proceeds from marketable securities, partially offset by increased capital expenditures in 2020.
Cash (used in) provided by financing activities
For the year ended December 31, 2021, cash used in financing activities was $319.8 million compared to $158.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020. The increase in cash used in financing activities is mainly due to the repurchase and cancellation of shares under the 2021 Repurchase Plan and dividends paid in 2021 compared to the redemption of the 2013 Notes and higher debt payments in 2020.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in financing activities was $158.4 million compared to cash provided by financing activities of $81.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash used in financing activities is mainly due to the proceeds from the issuance of the 2019 Notes in 2019 and higher debt payments in 2020.
Contractual Obligations
The Company enters into contracts in the normal course of business that give rise to commitments for future minimum payments. The following table summarizes the contractual obligations of the Company's financial liabilities, operating and capital commitments:
The Company believes working capital as of December 31, 2021, together with future cash flows from operations, are sufficient to support its commitments through 2022.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures to assist in understanding the Company's financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures are employed by the Company to measure its operating and economic performance and to assist in decision-making, as well as to provide key performance information to senior management. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, certain investors and other stakeholders will find this information useful to evaluate the Company's operating and financial performance; however, these non-GAAP performance measures do not have any standardized meaning. These performance measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Non-GAAP Measure - Cash Costs and AISC
The Company uses cash costs per ounce of precious metals sold to monitor its operating performance internally. The most directly comparable measure prepared in accordance with GAAP is production costs. The Company believes this measure provides investors and analysts with useful information about its underlying cash costs of operations and the impact of by-product credits on its cost structure. The Company also believes it is a relevant metric used to understand its operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow. When deriving the production costs associated with an ounce of precious metal, the Company includes by-product credits. Thereby allowing management and other stakeholders to assess the net costs of gold and silver production. In calculating cash costs per ounce, the Company also excludes the impact of specific items that are significant, but not reflective of its underlying operations, including the impact of measuring inventories at fair value in connection with business combinations.
AISC includes total production costs incurred at the Company's mining operations, which forms the basis of cash costs. Additionally, the Company includes sustaining capital expenditures, sustaining mine-site exploration and evaluation costs, reclamation cost accretion and amortization, and general and administrative expenses. This measure seeks to reflect the ongoing cost of gold and silver production from current operations; therefore, expansionary capital and non-sustaining expenditures are excluded. Certain other cash expenditures, including tax payments and financing costs are also excluded.
The Company believes that AISC represents the total costs of producing gold and silver from current operations and provides the Company and other stakeholders with additional information about its operating performance and ability to generate cash flows. It allows the Company to assess its ability to support capital expenditures and to sustain future production from the generation of operating cash flows.
When deriving the number of ounces of precious metal sold, the Company considers the physical ounces available for sale after the treatment and refining process, commonly referred to as payable metal, as this is what is sold to third parties.
AISC includes total production costs incurred at the Company's mining operations, which forms the basis of its cash costs and which are reconciled to reported production costs.
The following tables provide a reconciliation of production costs to cash costs and AISC:
(1)COVID-19 related costs include direct, incremental costs associated with COVID-19.
(2)Gold equivalent ounces have been established using realized metal prices per ounce of precious metal sold in the period and applied to the recovered metal content of the gold and silver sold by Çöpler, Marigold, Seabee and Puna. The Company has not included lead and zinc as they are considered a by-product.
(3)Gold equivalent ounces sold may not re-calculate based on amounts presented in this table due to rounding.

(3)Gold equivalent ounces sold may not re-calculate based on amounts presented in this table due to rounding.
Non-GAAP Measure - Adjusted Attributable Net Income
Adjusted attributable net income and adjusted attributable net income per share are used by management and investors to measure the Company's underlying operating performance. The most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP are net income attributable to equity holders of SSR Mining and net income per share attributable to equity holders of SSR Mining. Adjusted attributable net income is defined as net income adjusted to exclude the after-tax impact of specific items that are significant, but not reflective of the Company's underlying operations, including the impact of measuring inventories and mineral properties at fair value in connection with business combinations; impairment adjustments and reversals; foreign exchange (gains) losses and inflationary impacts on tax balances; transaction, integration and SEC conversion expenses; changes in tax rate for fair value adjustments and other non-recurring items.
The following table provides a reconciliation of net income attributable to equity holders of SSR Mining to adjusted net income attributable to equity holders of SSR Mining:
(1)Fair value adjustments on acquired assets relate to the acquisition of Alacer's inventories and mineral properties.
(2)COVID-19 related costs include direct, incremental costs associated with COVID-19 at all operations.
Non-GAAP Measure - Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") and Adjusted EBITDA
EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. EBITDA is an indicator of the Company's ability to generate liquidity by producing operating cash flow to fund working capital needs, service debt obligations, and fund capital expenditures.
Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted to exclude the impact of specific items that are significant, but not reflective of the Company's underlying operations, including the impact of measuring inventories at fair value in connection with business combinations; impairment adjustments and reversals; foreign exchange gains (losses); transaction and integration expenses; unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives; and other non-recurring items.
The most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is net income attributable to equity holders of SSR Mining.
The following is a reconciliation of net income attributable to equity holders of SSR Mining to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA:
(1)Fair value adjustments on acquired inventories relate to the acquisition of Alacer.
(2)COVID-19 related costs include direct, incremental costs associated with COVID-19 at all operations.
Non-GAAP Measure - Free Cash Flow
The Company uses free cash flow to supplement information in its consolidated financial statements. The most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP is cash provided by operating activities. The Company believes that in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with US GAAP, certain investors and analysts use this information to evaluate the ability of the Company to generate cash flow after capital investments and build the Company's cash resources. The Company calculates free cash flow by deducting cash capital spending from cash generated by operating activities.
The following table provides a reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow:
Critical Accounting Estimates
MD&A is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with US GAAP. The preparation of these statements requires that the Company makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The Company bases these estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that the Company considers reasonable under the circumstances; however, reported results could differ from those based on the current estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The areas requiring the use of management’s estimates are also discussed in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The policies identified as being critical to the understanding of our business and results of operations and that require the application of significant management judgment are outlined below.
Recoverable metal in stockpiles and leach pads
The Company estimates the quantity of recoverable metal in stockpiled ore and on leach pads using surveyed volumes of material, ore grades determined through sampling and assaying of blastholes, and estimated recovery rates based on ore type. The quantity of recoverable metal and recovery rates varies based on ore mineralogy, ore grade, ore particle sizes and the percentage of cyanide soluble gold. The estimated recoverable gold ounces placed on the leach pads are periodically reconciled by comparing the related ore to the actual gold ounces recovered (metallurgical balancing). The ultimate recoverable metal or life-of-mine recovery rate is unknown until mining operations cease. Accounting for recoverable metal in stockpiled ore and on leach pads represents a critical accounting estimate because (i) it is impracticable to determine metal contained in stockpiles and leach pads by physical count, thus requiring management to employ reasonable estimation methods and (ii) recovery rates from leach stockpiles can vary significantly. A change in the recovery rate or the quantity of recoverable gold ounces in our stockpiles or ore on leach pads could materially impact our financial statements.
Mineral reserves
Recoverable proven and probable reserves are the part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The determination of reserves involves numerous uncertainties with respect to the geology of the ore bodies, including quantities, grades and recovery rates. Estimating the quantity and grade of mineral reserves requires us to determine the size, shape and depth of our ore bodies by analyzing geological data, such as samplings of drill holes, tunnels and other underground workings. In addition to the geology of our mines, assumptions are required to determine the economic feasibility of mining these reserves, including estimates of future commodity prices and demand, the mining methods we use and the related costs incurred to develop and mine our reserves. The Company's estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves are prepared by and are the responsibility of its employees. These estimates are reviewed and verified regularly by independent experts in mining, geology and reserve determination.
As discussed in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the Company depreciates its mineral properties and mine development costs using the units-of-production method based on the estimated recoverable ounces in proven and probable reserves. Because the economic assumptions used to estimate mineral reserves may change from period to period and additional geological data is generated during the course of operations, estimates of reserves may change, which could have a significant impact on our results of operations, including changes to prospective depreciation rates and impairments of long-lived asset carrying values.
Impairment of long-lived assets
The Company assesses the carrying value of its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that could indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, significant adverse changes in the business climate including changes in future metal prices, significant changes to the extent or manner in which the asset is being used or its physical condition including significant decreases in production or mineral reserves, and significant decreases in the market price of the assets. In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, estimates of undiscounted future cash flows of the Company's mines are used. Estimates of future cash flows are derived from current business plans which are developed using short and long-term metal price assumptions; estimates of costs; resource, reserve and exploration potential estimates, including timing and costs to develop and produce the material; and the use of discount rates in the measurement of fair value. The Company believes its estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use.
Goodwill
Goodwill is allocated to reporting units and is tested for impairment annually as of December 31 and when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. In testing for goodwill impairment, the Company first evaluates qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the carrying value exceeds the fair value, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed by determining the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using either the income approach by utilizing estimates of discounted future cash flows or the market approach utilizing recent transaction activity for comparable properties. Estimates of future cash flows are derived from current business plans which are developed using short and long-term metal price assumptions; estimates of costs; resource, reserve and exploration potential estimates, including timing and costs to develop and produce the material; and the use of discount rates in the measurement of fair value.
Income taxes
Deferred income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by applying the enacted statutory tax rates in effect at the end of a reporting period to the cumulative temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The effect on deferred taxes for a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company's operations are in multiple jurisdictions where uncertainties arise in the application of complex tax regulations. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, while others are defined by general tax laws and regulations. The Company is subject to reviews of its income tax filings and other tax payments, and disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation of its contracts or laws.
The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the final resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the estimated tax liabilities prove to be less than the final assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If the estimated tax liabilities prove to be greater than the final assessment, a tax benefit would result. In certain jurisdictions, the Company must pay a portion of the disputed amount to the local government in order to formally appeal the assessment. Such payment is recorded as a receivable if the Company believes the amount is ultimately collectible.
A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion of the benefit from deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, the Company considers estimated future taxable income or loss as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction. If the Company determines all or a portion of our deferred income tax assets will not be realized, the valuation allowance will be increased. Conversely, if the Company determines all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided will ultimately be realized, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced.
Reclamation liabilities
The Company recognizes a liability for the fair value of estimated future reclamation costs when incurred. Reclamation liabilities are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of reclamation costs. The estimated reclamation liability is based on when spending for an existing disturbance is expected to occur. The Company reviews, on an annual basis, unless otherwise deemed necessary, the reclamation obligation at each mine site.
Remediation costs are accrued based on the Company’s best estimate at the end of each period of the costs expected to be incurred at a site. Accounting for reclamation liabilities requires the Company to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. Any such changes in future costs, the timing of reclamation activities, scope, or the exclusion of certain costs not considered reclamation costs, could materially impact the amounts charged to earnings for reclamation. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation work required.
New Accounting Pronouncements
As of December 31, 2021, the Company has adopted all accounting pronouncements affecting the Company.
Risks and Uncertainties
The mining industry involves many risks including global pandemics which are inherent to the nature of the business, global economic trends and economic, environmental and social conditions in the geographical areas of operation. As a result, the Company is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, each of which could have an adverse effect on its operating results, business prospects or financial position. The Company continuously assesses and evaluates these risks, seeking to minimize them by implementing high operating standards and processes to identify, assess, report and monitor risk across the organization.
For a comprehensive list of other known risks and uncertainties affecting the business, please refer to the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Part 1, Item 1A.
