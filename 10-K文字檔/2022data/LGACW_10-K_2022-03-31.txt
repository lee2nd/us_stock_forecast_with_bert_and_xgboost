ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the notes related thereto which are included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
We are a blank check company, incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. Lazard Ltd, an affiliate of our sponsor, intends to use resources across its international financial advisory and asset management businesses to source and evaluate attractive, high growth private companies. Although we are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region in our identification and acquisition of a target company, we believe the growth-oriented subsectors of the healthcare, technology, energy transition, financial and consumer sectors present particularly attractive investment opportunities. Our activities through December 31, 2021, related to our formation, our IPO, which was consummated on February 12, 2021, and thereafter searching for and evaluating potential business combination targets. During the fiscal period ended December 31, 2020, our efforts were limited to organizational activities.
Results of Operations
We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash equivalents held in the trust account. We incurred expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as due diligence expenses.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had a net loss of $1,663,133, which consisted of interest income on the cash equivalents held in the trust account of $33,252, a change in fair value on the warrants sold in the IPO and the private placement warrants of $4,535,000, offset by operating costs of $5,516,891. Operating costs primarily relate to professional fees of $501,950, due diligence costs of $3,787,613, insurance costs of $894,152, administrative support fees of $220,000, and regulatory and compliance costs of $101,808, other costs of $11,368. Additionally, the Company incurred offering costs that were expensed related to the closing of our IPO of $714,494.
For the period from December 10, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020, we had a net loss of $7,000, which consisted of formation costs.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
On February 12, 2021, we consummated our IPO of 57,500,000 of our units, including 7,500,000 units sold upon exercise in full of the underwriter’s over-allotment option. Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, $0.0001 par value per share, and one-fifth of one public warrant, with each whole public warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $575,000,000. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC acted as Book-Running Manager. The securities sold in the IPO were registered under the Securities Act on a registration statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-252408), which was declared effective by the SEC on February 9, 2021.
Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO and the issuance and sale of the units, the Company consummated the sale to the sponsor of 9,000,000 private placement warrants, with each private placement warrant exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share subject to adjustment, at a price of $1.50 per
private placement warrant, generating total proceeds of $13,500,000. The private placement warrants are identical to the public warrants, except that, so long as they are held by the sponsor or its permitted transferees, (i) they will not be redeemable by us, (ii) they (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of these private placement warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by our sponsor until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination, (iii) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis and (iv) they will be entitled to registration rights.
A total of $575,000,000, comprised of $563,500,000 of the proceeds from the IPO and $11,500,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the private placement warrants, was placed in the trust account. Transaction costs amounted to $32,476,988, consisting of $11,500,000 of underwriting fees (a net underwriting fee of $8,500,000 after giving effect to the underwriter’s reimbursement of the Company for $3,000,000 of financial advisory fees payable by the Company to Lazard Frères & Co. LLC), $20,125,000 of deferred underwriting fees (as may be reduced as a result of the underwriter’s reimbursement to the Company for certain financial advisory fees payable by the Company to Lazard Frères & Co. LLC) and $851,988 of professional fees and other offering related costs.
We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account (less taxes payable and deferred underwriting commissions), to complete our initial business combination. We may withdraw interest income (if any) to pay taxes, if any. Any remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.
In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, the sponsor has, on August 5, 2021, amended the working capital loan to increase the borrowing limit from $1,300,000 to $2,000,000 to be provided to us to fund our expenses relating to investigating and selecting a target business and other working capital requirements prior to our initial business combination. On March 30, 2022, the Sponsor further amended the working capital loan to provide additional borrowing up to a total borrowing of $5,000,000. If we complete our initial business combination, we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment.
At the lender’s discretion, up to $2,000,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants.
The sponsor or an affiliate of the sponsor may, but is not obligated to, loan us additional funds as may be required. However, the terms of such additional loans have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or its affiliates as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.
We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in the trust account, or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we would be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account.
Off-balance Sheet Financing Arrangements
We have no obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.
We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or entered into any non-financial agreements involving assets.
Contractual Obligations
At December 31, 2021, we did not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities other than as described below.
On February 10, 2021, we entered into an administrative support agreement pursuant to which we have agreed to pay an affiliate of the sponsor a total of $20,000 per month for office space, administrative and support services. Upon the earlier of the completion of the initial business combination and the Company’s liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. The underwriter of the IPO received a cash underwriting discount of $0.20 per Unit, or $11,500,000 in the aggregate, upon the closing of the IPO. In addition, the underwriter will be entitled to deferred commissions of $0.35 per Unit, or $20,125,000 in the aggregate. The deferred underwriting discount will be paid to the underwriter solely in the event that the Company completes a business combination within the time required, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and expenses during the periods reported. Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment and available information. Therefore, actual results could materially differ from those estimates and could have a material impact on the financial statements. We have identified the following as our critical accounting policies.
Net Income (Loss) Per Ordinary Share
We comply with accounting and disclosure requirements of ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. Net income (loss) per share of ordinary shares is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, excluding ordinary shares subject to forfeiture. We apply the two-class method in calculating earnings per share, whereby the net income (loss) is allocated ratably to the two classes of ordinary shares.
As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding warrants to purchase up to 20,500,000 Class A ordinary shares. The weighted average of these shares was excluded from the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share of ordinary shares since the exercise of the warrants is contingent upon the occurrence of future events. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 1,875,000 Class B ordinary shares that were subject to forfeiture depending on the extent to which the underwriter’s over-allotment option was exercised. These Class B ordinary shares were excluded from the calculation of the basic and diluted weighted average number of non-redeemable Class B ordinary shares outstanding at December 31, 2020, and basic and diluted net loss per share of non-redeemable Class B ordinary shares at December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not have any dilutive securities or other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into ordinary shares and then share in our earnings. As a result, diluted income (loss) per ordinary share is the same as basic income (loss) per ordinary share for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the period from December 10, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020.
Deferred Offering Costs
We comply with the requirements of the ASC Topic 340-10-S99-1 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A -“Expenses of Offering.” Offering costs in connection with our IPO amounted to $32,476,988, consisting of $11,500,000 of underwriting discount, $20,125,000 of deferred underwriting commissions and $851,988 of other
offering costs. These costs were allocated to the Class A ordinary shares and the one-fifth warrants included in the Units sold in the IPO and $31,762,494 was charged to permanent equity and $714,494 was expensed.
Warrants
Under ASC Topic 815, we have classified issued warrants as liabilities remeasured at fair value, with changes in fair value each period reported to earnings.
Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption
In accordance with ASC 480, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require the security to be classified outside of permanent equity. Accordingly, all of the 57,500,000 Class A ordinary shares included in the Units were classified outside of permanent equity.
Recent accounting pronouncements
In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (“ASU 2020-06”) to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity’s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity’s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective for small reporting companies beginning January 1, 2024 and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that ASU 2020-06 would have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
