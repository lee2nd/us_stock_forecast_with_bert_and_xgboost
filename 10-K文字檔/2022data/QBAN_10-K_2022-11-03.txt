ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The financial data presented below should be read in conjunction with the more detailed financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this report. Information discussed herein, as well as elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, includes forward-looking statements or opinions regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company, and are subject to a number of risks and other factors which could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements. Among such factors are general business and economic conditions, and risk factors as listed in this Form 10-K or listed from time to time in documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Financial Condition
As of November 30, 2016, the Company had total current assets of $26,864 and total current liabilities of $5,381,900 for a net working capital deficit of $5,355,036. As of November 30, 2015, the Company had total current assets of $17,100 and total current liabilities of $6,200,054 for a net working capital deficit of $6,182,954.
We need to raise additional money to meet our general and administrative expenses, and we need to raise money to achieve our business objectives. The additional funding will come from equity financing from the sale of Telco Cuba’s common stock or the issuance of debt securities. If we are successful in completing an equity financing, existing shareholders will experience dilution of their interest in Telco Cuba. The Company does not have any financing arranged and we cannot provide investors with any assurance that the Company will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of its common stock or debt securities. In the absence of such financing, our business will fail.
Based on the nature of Telco Cuba’s business, management anticipates incurring operating losses in the foreseeable future. Management bases this expectation, in part, on the fact that unrolling a telecommunications operation will cost a substantial amount of money, and possibly take several years before becoming profitable. The Company’s future financial results are also uncertain due to a number of factors, some of which are outside its control. These factors include, but are not limited to:
Telco Cuba’s ability to raise additional funding;
Telco Cuba’s ability to capture market share; and
Due to the Company’s lack of operating history and present inability to generate revenues, our independent auditors have added an explanatory paragraph to their audit opinion issued in connection with our financial statements for 2015, and 2016 indicating substantial doubt about Telco Cuba’s ability to continue as a going concern. This means that there is substantial doubt whether the Company can continue as an ongoing business for the next 12 months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills.
Liquidity
The Company’s internal sources of liquidity will be loans that may be available from management as well as revenue from its subsidiaries. Although Telco Cuba has no written arrangements with its management, we expect that the officers may provide the Company with nominal liquidity, when and if it is required.
The Company’s external sources of liquidity will be private placements for equity and debt financing. There are no assurances that Telco Cuba will be able to achieve further sales of its common stock or any other form of additional financing. If we are unable to achieve the financing necessary to continue its plan of operations, then the Company will not be able to continue its operations and its business will fail.
Capital Resources
As of November 30, 2016, the Company had total assets of $41,602, total liabilities $5,381,900, and a working capital deficit of $5,355,036.
As of November 30, 2015, the Company had total assets of $32,101, total liabilities $6,200,054, and a working capital deficit of $6,182,954.
The Company’s current cash is not sufficient to fully finance its operations at current and planned levels for the next 12 months. Management intends to manage the Company’s expenses and payments to preserve cash until the Company is profitable, otherwise additional financing must be arranged. Specifically, management is deferring payments due them until such time as there is sufficient financing in place to permit their payment or the possible issuance of the Company’s stock in settlement of amounts due.
Results of Operations
We earned total revenues of $146,731 for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2016.
We earned total revenues of $173,560 for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2015.
We are presently in the development stage of our business, and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to generate revenues from the sale of telecommunications services in the future. The company’s subsidiary, Amgentech, Inc., has been actively providing infrastructure and telecommunication services during these periods. The revenue presented is attributed to the acquisition of Amgentech, Inc.
We incurred operating expenses in the amount of $359,634 during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2016.
We incurred operating expenses in the amount of $657,927 during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2015.
Other Income and Expense
During the years ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred interest expense of $335,120, and $290,819, respectively, which was incurred on the Company’s third-party debt and convertible debentures.
For the years ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded a gain of $1,192,310, and a loss of $(222,251), respectively, attributable to fluctuations in the valuation of the derivative liability.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.

In July 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with Next Group Holdings pursuant to which Next Group agreed to provide a virtual call processing platform for telecommunications, a web portal and sales portal.
