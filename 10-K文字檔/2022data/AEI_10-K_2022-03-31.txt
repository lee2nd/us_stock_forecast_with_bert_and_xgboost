Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Business Overview
We are a diversified holding company principally engaged through our subsidiaries in the development of EHome communities and other real estate, financial services, digital transformation technologies, biohealth activities and consumer products with operations in the United States, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and South Korea. We manage our three principal businesses primarily through our 77% owned subsidiary, Alset International Limited, a public company traded on the Singapore Stock Exchange. Through this subsidiary (and indirectly, through other public and private U.S. and Asian subsidiaries), we are actively developing real estate projects near Houston, Texas and in Frederick, Maryland in our real estate segment. We have designed applications for enterprise messaging and e-commerce software platforms in the United States and Asia in our digital transformation technology business unit. Our biohealth segment includes the sale of consumer products.
We also have ownership interests outside of Alset International, including a 41.3% equity interest in American Pacific Bancorp Inc., an indirect 15.8% equity interest in Holista CollTech Limited, a 15.5% equity interest in True Partner Capital Holding Limited, a 24.9% equity interest in DSS Inc. (“DSS”), an 18% equity interest in Value Exchange International, Inc., a 17.5% equity interest in American Premium Water Corp., and an interest in Alset Capital Acquisition Corp. (“Alset Capital”). American Pacific Bancorp Inc. is a financial network holding company. Holista CollTech Limited is a public Australian company that produces natural food ingredients (ASX: HCT). True Partner Capital Holding Limited is a public Hong Kong company which operates as a fund management company in the U.S. and Hong Kong. DSS is a multinational company operating businesses within nine divisions: product packaging, biotechnology, direct marketing, commercial lending, securities and investment management, alternative trading, digital transformation, secure living, and alternative energy. DSS Inc. is listed on the NYSE American (NYSE: DSS). Value Exchange International, Inc. is a provider of information technology services for businesses, and is traded on the OTCQB (OTCQB: VEII). American Premium Water Corp. is a publicly traded consumer products company (OTCPK: HIPH). Alset Capital is a newly organized blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses and is listed on the Nasdaq (Nasdaq: ACAXU, ACAX, ACAXW and ACAXR).
We generally acquire majority and/or control stakes in innovative and promising businesses that are expected to appreciate in value over time. Our emphasis is on building businesses in industries where our management team has in-depth knowledge and experience, or where our management can provide value by advising on new markets and expansion. We have at times provided a range of global capital and management services to these companies in order to gain access to Asian markets. We have historically favored businesses that improve an individual’s quality of life or that improve the efficiency of businesses through technology in various industries. We believe our capital and management services provide us with a competitive advantage in the selection of strategic acquisitions, which creates and adds value for our company and our stockholders.
Our Revenue Model
Our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $19,798,822 and $16,238,200, respectively. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $119,017,591 and $5,100,318, respectively.
We currently recognize revenue from the sale of our subdivision development properties, rental homes and the sale of our biohealth products. Sales of real properties accounted for approximately 70%, revenue from houses rental accounted for approximately 2% and sales of biohealth products accounted for approximately 28% of our total revenue in the year ended December 31, 2021. Sales of real properties accounted for approximately 84% and sales of biohealth products accounted for approximately 16% of our total revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020.
From a geographical perspective, we recognized 72% and 84% of our total revenue in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in the United States. 28% and 16% of our revenue in 2021 and 2020, respectively was recognized from our sales in South Korea.
We believe that, on an ongoing basis, revenue generated from our property development business will decline as a percentage of our total revenue as we expect to experience greater revenue contribution from our rental business, digital transformation technology, biohealth businesses and future business acquisitions.
Financial Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
Real Estate Projects
The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. The COVID-19 pandemic’s far-reaching impact on the global economy could negatively affect various aspects of our business, including demand for real estate. From March 2020 through December 2021, we continued to sell lots at our Ballenger Run project (in Maryland) for the construction of town homes to NVR. Sales of such homes to NVR were 88 lots in 2021 and 121 in 2020. Such town homes are often buyers’ first home that generally did not require them to sell an existing home. We believe low interest rates encouraged home sales. Many buyers opted to see home models at the project virtually. This technology allowed them to ask questions to sales staff and see the town homes. Home closings often occurred electronically.
We have received strong indications that buyers and renters across the country are expressing interest in moving from more densely populated urban areas to the suburbs. We believe that our Ballenger Run project is well suited and positioned to accommodate those buyers. Our latest phase for sale at Ballenger Run, involving single-family homes, has seen a high number of interested potential buyers signing up for additional information and updates on home availability.
The COVID-19 pandemic could impact the ability of our staff and contractors to continue to work, and our ability to conduct our operations in a prompt and efficient manner. To date, we experienced a slowdown in the construction of a clubhouse at the Ballenger Run project, which was completed behind schedule. We believe this delay was caused in part by policies requiring lower numbers of contractors working in indoor spaces.
The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact the timeliness of local government in granting required approvals. Accordingly, the COVID-19 pandemic may cause the completion of important stages in our real estate projects to be delayed.
At our Black Oak project in Texas, we have strategically redesigned the lots for a smaller “starter home” products that we believe will be more resilient in fluctuating markets. Should we initiate sales at Black Oak, we believe the same implications described above, regarding our Ballenger Run project, may apply to our Black Oak project (including the general trend of customers’ interest shifting from urban to suburban areas). Unlike our Ballenger Run project, our Black Oak project may include our involvement in single family rental home development.
On April 6, 2020, the Company entered into a term note with M&T Bank with a principal amount of $68,502 pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP Term Note”) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. The PPP Loan is evidenced by a promissory note. The PPP Term Note bears interest at a fixed annual rate of 1.00%, with the first ten months of principal and interest deferred. On November 26, 2020, $64,502 of this loan was forgiven by the United States Small Business Administration and $64,502 was recorded as other income. The remaining balance of $4,000 was paid back in December 2020.
On February 11, 2021, the Company entered into a term note with M&T Bank with a principal amount of $68,502 pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP Term Note”) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). The PPP Loan is evidenced by a promissory note. The PPP Term Note bears interest at a fixed annual rate of 1.00%, with the first sixteen months of principal and interest deferred or until we apply for the loan forgiveness. The PPP Term Note may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default.
On June 18, 2020, Alset EHome Inc. (formerly known as SeD Home Inc., SeD Home & REITs Inc. and then Alset iHome Inc.) entered into a Loan Agreement with M&T Bank. Pursuant to this Loan Agreement, M&T Bank provided a non-revolving loan to Alset EHome Inc. in an aggregate amount of up to $2,990,000, as described in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. It was intended for this loan to be utilized to commence our residential initiatives. The loan was closed in June 2021.
Other Business Activities
The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact our potential to expand our business activities in ways that are difficult to assess or predict. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and may continue to impact, the global supply of certain goods and services in ways that may impact the sale of products to consumers that we, or companies we may invest in or partner with, will attempt to make. The COVID-19 pandemic may prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive opportunities.
COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our operations in South Korea; since the start of the pandemic, the South Korean government has at various times placed certain restrictions on business meetings to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Such restrictions have impacted our ability to recruit potential affiliate sales personnel, and to introduce products to a larger audience.
Impact on Staff
Most of our U.S. staff works out of our Bethesda, Maryland office. At our office in Texas, we received a 50% rent abatement for the month of May 2020.
Our U.S. staff has shifted to mostly working from home since March 2020, but this has had a minimal impact on our operations to date. Our staff in Singapore and Hong Kong has been able to work from home when needed with minimal impact on our operations, however our staff’s ability to travel between our Hong Kong and Singapore offices has been significantly limited, and our staff’s travel between the U.S. and non-U.S. offices has been suspended since March 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted the frequency with which our management would otherwise travel to the Black Oaks project; however, we have a contractor in Texas providing supervision of the project. Management continues to regularly supervise the Ballenger Run project. Limitations on the mobility of our management and staff may slow down our ability to enter into new transactions and expand existing projects.
We have not reduced our staff in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, we did not have to expend significant resources related to employee health and safety matters related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have a small staff, however, and the inability of any significant number of our staff to work due to illness or the illness of a family member could adversely impact our operations.
Matters that May or Are Currently Affecting Our Business
In addition to the matters described above, the primary challenges and trends that could affect or are affecting our financial results include:
● Our ability to improve our revenue through cross-selling and revenue-sharing arrangements among our diverse group of companies;
● Our ability to identify complementary businesses for acquisition, obtain additional financing for these acquisitions, if and when needed, and profitably integrate them into our existing operation;
● Our ability to attract competent, skilled technical and sales personnel for each of our businesses at acceptable compensation levels to manage our overhead; and
● Our ability to control our operating expenses as we expand each of our businesses and product and service offerings.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include all accounts of the Company and its majority owned and controlled subsidiaries. The Company consolidates entities in which it owns more than 50% of the voting common stock and controls operations. All intercompany transactions and balances among consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates and Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates made by management include, but are not limited to, allowance for doubtful accounts, recoverability and useful lives of property, plant and equipment, valuation of real estate assets, allocation of development costs and capitalized interest to sold lots, the valuation allowance of deferred taxes, contingencies and equity compensation. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Transactions between Entities under Common Control
On March 12, 2021, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with Chan Heng Fai, the founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, for four proposed transactions, consisting of (i) purchase of certain warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase 1,500,000,000 shares of Alset International Limited, which was valued at $28,363,966; (ii) purchase of all of the issued and outstanding stock of LiquidValue Development Pte Ltd. (“LVD”), which was valued at $173,395; (iii) purchase of 62,122,908 ordinary shares in True Partner Capital Holding Limited (HKG: 8657) (“True Partner”), which was valued at $6,729,629; and (iv) purchase of 4,775,523 shares of the common stock of American Pacific Bancorp Inc. (“APB”), which was valued at $28,653,138. The total amount of above four transactions was $63,920,129, payable on the Closing Date by the Company, in the convertible promissory notes (“Alset CPNs”), which, subject to the terms and conditions of the Alset CPNs and the Company’s shareholder approval, shall be convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock (“AEI Common Stock”), par value $0.001 per share, at the conversion price of AEI’s Stock Market Price. AEI’s Stock Market Price shall be $5.59 per share, equivalent to the average of the five closing per share prices of AEI’s Common Stock preceding January 4, 2021 as quoted by Bloomberg L.P. The above four acquisitions from Chan Heng Fai were transactions between entities under common control.
On October 15, 2020, American Pacific Bancorp (which subsequently became a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company) entered into an acquisition agreement to acquire 3,500,001 common shares of HengFeng Finance Limited (“HFL”), representing 100% of the common shares of HFL, in consideration for $1,500,000, to be satisfied by the issuance and allotment of 250,000 shares of the Class A Common Stock of American Pacific Bancorp. HFL is incorporated in Hong Kong with limited liability. The principal activities of HFL are money lending, securities trading and investment. This transaction closed on April 21, 2021. This transaction between the Company and Chan Heng Fai is under common control of Chan Heng Fai. In third quarter of 2021 APB was deconsolidated due to our loss of majority ownership.
The common control transactions resulted in the following basis of accounting for the financial reporting periods:
● The acquisition of the Warrants and True Partner stock were accounted for prospectively as of March 12, 2021 and they did not represent a change in reporting entity.
● The acquisition of LVD, APB and HFL was under common control and was consolidated in accordance with ASC 850-50. The consolidated financial statements were retrospectively adjusted for the acquisition of LVD, APB and HFL, and the operating results of LVD, APB and HFL as of January 1, 2020 for comparative purposes.
AEI’s stock price was $10.03 on March 12, 2021, the commitment date. The Beneficial Conversion Feature (“BCF”) intrinsic value was $50,770,192 for the four convertible promissory notes and was recorded as debt discount of convertible notes after these transactions. The debt discount attributable to the BCF is amortized over period from issuance to the date that the debt becomes convertible using the effective interest method. If the debt is converted, the discount is amortized to finance cost in full immediately. On May 13, 2021 and June 14, 2021 all Alset CPNs of $63,920,128 and accrued interests of $306,438 were converted into 2,123 shares of series B preferred stock and 9,163,965 shares of common stock of the Company.
Revenue Recognition and Cost of Revenue
The following represents a disaggregation of our revenue recognition policies by segment:
Real Estate
● Property Sales. The Company’s main business is land development. The Company purchases land and develops it into residential communities. The developed lots are sold to builders (customers) for the construction of new homes. The builders enter into a sales contract with the Company before they take the lots. The prices and timeline are determined and agreed upon in the contract. The builders do the inspections to make sure all conditions and requirements in contracts are met before purchasing the lots. A detailed breakdown of the five-step process for the revenue recognition of the Ballenger and Black Oak projects, which represented approximately 70% and 84% of the Company’s revenue in the years ended on December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, is as follows:
Identify the contract with a customer. The Company has signed agreements with the builders for developing the raw land to ready to build lots. The contract has agreed upon prices, timelines, and specifications for what is to be provided.
Identify the performance obligations in the contract. Performance obligations of the Company include delivering developed lots to the customer, which are required to meet certain specifications that are outlined in the contract. The customer inspects all lots prior to accepting title to ensure all specifications are met.
Determine the transaction price. The transaction price per lot is fixed and specified in the contract. Any subsequent change orders or price changes are required to be approved by both parties.
Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract. Each lot is considered to be a separate performance obligation, for which the specified price in the contract is allocated to.
Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies performance obligation. The builders do the inspections to make sure all conditions/requirements are met before taking title of lots. The Company recognizes revenue at a point in time when title is transferred. The Company does not have further performance obligations or continuing involvement once title is transferred.
● Sale of the Front Foot Benefit Assessments. We have established a front foot benefit (“FFB”) assessment on all of the lots sold to NVR. This is a 30-year annual assessment allowed in Frederick County which requires homeowners to reimburse the developer for the costs of installing public water and sewer to the lots. These assessments become effective as homes are settled, at which time we can sell the collection rights to investors who will pay an upfront lump sum, enabling us to more quickly realize the revenue. The selling prices range from $3,000 to $4,500 per home depending on the type of home. Our total expected revenue from the front foot benefit assessment is approximately $1 million. To recognize revenue of the FFB assessment, both our and NVR’s performance obligations have to be satisfied. Our performance obligation is completed once we complete the construction of water and sewer facilities and close the lot sales with NVR, which inspects these water and sewer facilities prior to the close of lot sales to ensure all specifications are met. NVR’s performance obligation is to sell homes they build to homeowners. Our FFB revenue is recognized upon NVR’s sales of homes to homeowners. The agreement with these FFB investors is not subject to amendment by regulatory agencies and thus our revenue from FFB assessment is not either. During the years ended December, 2021 and 2020, we recognized revenue in the amounts of $289,375 and $273,620 from FFB assessments, respectively.
● Rental Revenue. The Company leases real estate properties to its tenants under leases that are predominately classified as operating leases, in accordance with ASC 842, Leases (“ASC 842”). Real estate rental revenue is comprised of minimum base rent and revenue from the collection of lease termination fees.
Rent from tenants is recorded in accordance with the terms of each lease agreement on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease. Rental revenue recognition begins when the tenant controls the space and continues through the term of the related lease. Generally, at the end of the lease term, the Company provides the tenant with a one year renewal option, including mostly the same terms and conditions provided under the initial lease term, subject to rent increases.
The Company defers rental revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates. These amounts are presented within deferred revenues and other payables on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
Rental revenue is subject to an evaluation for collectability on several factors, including payment history, the financial strength of the tenant and any guarantors, historical operations and operating trends of the property, and current economic conditions. If our evaluation of these factors indicates that it is not probable that we will recover substantially all of the receivable, rental revenue is limited to the lesser of the rental revenue that would be recognized on a straight-line basis (as applicable) or the lease payments that have been collected from the lessee. Differences between rental revenue recognized and amounts contractually due under the lease agreements are credited or charged to straight-line rent receivable or straight-line rent liability, as applicable. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company didn’t recognize any deferred revenue and collected all rents due.
● Cost of Revenue. Land acquisition costs are allocated to each lot based on the area method, the size of the lot comparing to the total size of all lots in the project. Development costs and capitalized interest are allocated to lots sold based on the total expected development and interest costs of the completed project and allocating a percentage of those costs based on the selling price of the sold lot compared to the expected sales values of all lots in the project.
If the allocation of development costs and capitalized interest based on the projection and relative expected sales value is impracticable, those costs could also be allocated based on an area method, which uses the size of the lots compared to the total project area and allocates costs based on their size.
Cost of rental revenue consists primarily of the costs associated with management and leasing fees to our management company, repairs and maintenance, depreciation and other related administrative costs. Utility expenses are paid directly by tenants.
Digital Transformation Technology
● Software Development Income. Revenue is recognized when (or as) the Company transfers promised goods or services to its customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services, which occurs when (or as) the Company satisfies its contractual obligations and transfers over control of the promised goods or services to its customers. We generate revenue from a project involving provision of services and web/software development for customers. In respect to the provision of services, the agreements are less than one year with a cancellation clause and customers are typically billed on a monthly basis.
Biohealth
● Product Direct Sales. The Company’s net sales consist of product sales. The Company’s performance obligation is to transfer its products to its third-party independent distributors (“Distributors”). The Company generally recognizes revenue when product is shipped to its Distributors.
The Company’s Distributors may receive distributor allowances, which are comprised of discounts, rebates and wholesale commission payments from the Company. Distributor allowances resulting from the Company’s sales of its products to its Distributors are recorded against net sales because the distributor allowances represent discounts from the suggested retail price.
In addition to distributor allowances, the Company compensates its sales leader Distributors with leadership incentives for services rendered, relating to the development, retention, and management of their sales organizations. Leadership Incentives are payable based on achieved sales volume, which are recorded in general and administrative expenses. The Company recognizes revenue when it ships products. The Company receives the net sales price in cash or through credit card payments at the point of sale.
If a Distributor returns a product to the Company on a timely basis, they may obtain a replacement product from the Company for such returned product. In addition, the Company maintains a buyback program pursuant to which it will repurchase products sold to a Distributor who has decided to leave the business. Allowances for product returns, primarily in connection with the Company’s buyback program, are provided at the time the sale is recorded. This accrual is based upon historical return rates for each country and the relevant return pattern, which reflects anticipated returns to be received over a period of up to 12 months following the original sale.
● Annual Membership. The Company collects an annual membership fee from its Distributors. The fee is fixed, paid in full at the time of joining the membership and not refundable. The Company’s performance obligation is to provide members to purchase products, access to certain back office services, receive commissions and attend corporate events. The obligation is satisfied over time. The Company recognizes revenue associated with the membership over the one-year period of the membership. Before the membership fee is recognized as revenue, it is recorded as deferred revenue.
Real Estate Assets
Real estate assets are recorded at cost, except when acquired real estate assets meet the definition of a business combination in accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations,” which are recorded at fair value. Interest, property taxes, insurance and other incremental costs (including salaries) directly related to a project are capitalized during the construction period of major facilities and land improvements. The capitalization period begins when activities to develop the parcel commence and ends when the asset constructed is completed. The capitalized costs are recorded as part of the asset to which they relate and are reduced when lots are sold.
Capitalized construction costs of approximately $6.0 million and $10.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
On December 31, 2021, total real estate property under development was $15.7 million, including:
● land held for development in the amount of $9.0 million (consisting of $7.7 million for Black Oak, $0.1 million for Ballenger Run, $0.7 million for Alset Villas and $0.5 million for our Perth project);
● capitalized development costs in the amount of $3.4 million (consisting of $3.4 million for Black Oak); and
● capitalized finance costs were $3.2 million.
On December 31, 2020, total real estate property under development was $20.5 million, including:
● land held for development in the amount of $10.9 million (consisting of $6.9 million for Black Oak, $3.5 million for Ballenger Run and $0.5 million for our Perth project);
● capitalized development costs in the amount of $6.1 million (consisting of $1.2 million for Black Oak, $4.8 million for Ballenger Run and $0.1 million for our Perth project); and
● capitalized finance costs were $3.5 million.
On December 31, 2021, the capitalized construction costs were as follows:
On December 31, 2020, the capitalized construction costs were as follows:
Through December 31, 2021, there were no sales from the Perth project. In addition, no sales agreement had been signed for this project.
In 2021, our subsidiary Alset EHome Inc. acquired approximately 19.5 acres of partially developed land near Houston, Texas which will be used to develop a community named Alset Villas (“Alset Villas”). Alset EHome is targeting to develop approximately 63 homes at Alset Villas for rent and/or for sale. The Alset Villas project remains at the early stage.
Results of Operations
Summary of Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Loss for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Revenue
The following table sets forth period-over-period changes in revenues for each of our reporting segments:
Revenue was $19,798,822 and $16,238,200 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. An increase in rental revenue and direct sales from our indirect subsidiary HWH World in the 2021 contributed to higher revenue in this period. For our Ballenger Project, builders are required to purchase a minimum number of lots based on their applicable sale agreements. We collect revenue from the sale of lots to builders. We are not involved in the construction of homes at the present time.
Income from the sale of Front Foot Benefits (“FFBs”), assessed on Ballenger Run project lots, increased from $273,620 in the year ended December 31, 2020 to $289,375 in year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is a mixed result of the decreased sale of properties to homebuyers in 2021 and sale of FFBs of a higher value.
In the second quarter of 2021, the Company started renting homes to tenants. Revenue from this rental business was $327,296 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company expects that the revenue from this business will continue to increase as we acquire more rental houses and successfully rent them.
Revenues from our biohealth segment in the year ended December 31, 2020 included direct sales by iGalen Inc. (formerly known as iGalen USA, LLC), which was 100% owned by iGalen International Inc., Alset International’s 53%-owned subsidiary. On December 30, 2020 Alset International’s ownership of iGalen International was sold to one of the directors of iGalen International. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the revenue from iGalen Inc. was $89,567.
In recent years, the Company expanded its biohealth segment to the South Korean market through one of the subsidiaries of Health Wealth Happiness Pte. Ltd., HWH World Inc (“HWH World”). HWH World, similarly to iGalen Inc., operates based on a direct sale model of health supplements. HWH World recognized $5,543,066 and $2,504,944 in revenue in the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The category described as “Other” includes corporate and financial services and new venture businesses. “Other” includes certain costs that are not allocated to the reportable segments, primarily consisting of unallocated corporate overhead costs, including administrative functions not allocated to the reportable segments from global functional expenses.
The financial services and new venture businesses are small and diversified, and accordingly they are not separately addressed as one independent category. In the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the revenue from other businesses was $42,377 and $0, respectively, generated by Korean café shop.
Operating Expenses
The following table sets forth period-over-period changes in cost of revenue for each of our reporting segments:
Cost of revenue decreased from $12,085,574 in the year ended December 31, 2020 to $11,301,814 in the year ended December 31, 2021, as a result of the decrease in the number of lots sold in the Ballenger Run. Capitalized construction expenses, finance costs and land costs are allocated to sales. We anticipate the total cost of sales to increase as revenue increases.
The gross margin increased from $4,152,626 to $8,497,008 in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. The increase of gross margin was caused by the increase of gross margin of HWH World, mostly due to the increase in the sales and from increase in rental income.
The following table sets forth period-over-period changes in operating expenses for each of our reporting segments.
The increase of operating expenses of real estate segment in 2021 compared with 2020 was mostly caused by the increase of sales related expenses. Increase in expenses in our biohealth business is caused by the increased commission payments to our distributors, which is connected to increased sales. Additionally, the increase in professional fees, employee salaries and bonuses and directors’ remuneration in our other businesses contributed to increased operating expenses in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
Other Income (Expense)
In the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had other expense of $103,489,455 compared to other expense of $2,489,599 in the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in unrealized loss on securities investment and on financing costs are the primary reasons for the volatility in these two periods. Unrealized loss on securities investment was $49,190,748 in year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1,694,535 loss in the year ended December 31, 2020. Finance costs were $50,871,869 in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a $109,916 in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Discontinued Operations
On April 27, 2020, Global BioMedical Pte Ltd (“GBM”), one of our subsidiaries, entered into a share exchange agreement with DSS BioHealth Security, Inc. (“DBHS”), a wholly owned subsidiary of DSS, Inc. (“DSS”), pursuant to which, DBHS agreed to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of Impact BioMedical Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of GBM, through a share exchange. It was agreed that the aggregate consideration to be issued to GBM for the Impact BioMedical shares would be the following: (i) 483,334 newly issued shares of DSS common stock; and (ii) 46,868 newly issued shares of a new series of DSS perpetual convertible preferred stock with a stated value of $46,868,000 ($1,000 per share). The convertible preferred stock will be convertible into shares of DSS common stock at a conversion price of $6.48 of preferred stock stated value per share of common stock, subject to a 19.9% beneficial ownership conversion limitation (a so-called “blocker”) based on the total issued outstanding shares of common stock of DSS beneficially owned by GBM. Holders of the convertible preferred stock will have no voting rights, except as required by applicable law or regulation, and no dividends will accrue or be payable on the convertible preferred stock. The holders of convertible preferred stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, and DSS will have the right to redeem all or any portion of the then outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock, pro rata among all holders, at a redemption price per share equal to such liquidation value per share.
Under ASU 2014-08, a disposal transaction meets the definition of a discontinued operation if all of the following criteria are met:
1. The disposal group constitutes a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity.
2. The component of an entity (or group of components of an entity) meets the held-for-sale classification criteria, is disposed of by sale, or is disposed of other than by sale (e.g., “by abandonment, in an exchange measured based on the recorded amount of the nonmonetary asset relinquished, or in a distribution to owners in a spinoff”).
3. The disposal of a component of an entity (or group of components of an entity) “represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results”.
Impact BioMedical Inc and its subsidiaries have financial reporting. The transaction is a disposal by sale and has a major effect on our financial results. Since it meets all of the test criteria set forth above, we have treated this disposal transaction as a discontinued operations in our financial statements.
On August 21, 2020, the transaction closed and Impact BioMedical Inc became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of DBHS. GBM received 483,334 shares of DSS common stock and 46,868 shares of DSS preferred stock, which preferred shares could be converted to 7,232,716 common shares (however, any conversion will be subject to the blocker GBM has agreed to, as described above). After this transaction, we held 500,001 shares of the common stock of DSS, representing 9.7% of the outstanding common stock of DSS. Our CEO, Chan Heng Fai is an owner of the common stock of DSS (not including any common or preferred shares we held) and is the executive chairman of the board of directors of DSS. The Company has elected the fair value option for the DSS common stock that would otherwise be accounted for under the equity method of accounting. ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, defines the fair value of the financial assets. We value DSS common stock under level 1 category through quoted prices and preferred stock under level 2 category through the value of the common shares into which the preferred shares are convertible. The quoted price of DSS common stock was $6.95 as of August 21, 2020.

Net cash used in operating activities was $16,684,360 in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $317,612 in the same period of 2020. The higher purchase of trading securities for investment purposes explained the increased cash flow used in operating activities during year 2021.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $56,044,001 in the year 2021, as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $1,781,121 in the same period of 2020.

The increase in cash provided by financing activities in the year 2021 is primarily caused by the proceeds from stock issuance of $104,565,659 and exercise of subsidiary warrants of $3,249,339. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we also received cash proceeds of $280,000 from the sale of our GigWorld shares to individual investors and $68,502 from a loan.

Real Property Financing Arrangements
Through Alset International, we have three property development projects. Ballenger Run and Black Oak projects are the major projects.
The Company anticipates that the estimated construction costs (not including land costs and financing costs) for the final phases of the Ballenger Run project will be $1.7 million. The expected completion date for the final phases of the Ballenger Run project is June of 2022.
At the present time, the Company is also considering expanding its current policy of selling buildable lots to include a strategy of building housing for sale or rent, particularly at our Black Oak and Alset Villas properties. The required time and expenses needed to complete the Black Oak and Alset Villas projects will be influenced by the strategy, or mix of strategies, we utilize at each project.
Our Perth project in Australia is relatively small, representing approximately 2% of our total projects included in the estimated property costs and forecasted revenue, and the development plan of this project is contingent on the local market. We have been monitoring the local market, which has seen no significant improvement to date, and we will consider development once it is more confident in the market.
Black Oak
Black Oak is a land infrastructure and subdivision project situated in Magnolia, Texas, north of Houston. This project is owned by certain subsidiaries of Alset International.
Ballenger Run
In November 2015, through LiquidValue Development, we completed the $15.7 million acquisition of Ballenger Run, a 197-acre land subdivision development located in Frederick County, Maryland. Previously, on May 28, 2014, the RBG Family, LLC entered into the Assignable Real Estate Sales Contract with NVR, Inc. (“NVR”) by which RBG Family, LLC would sell the 197 acres for $15 million to NVR. On December 10, 2014, NVR assigned this contract to SeD Maryland Development, LLC in the Assignment and Assumption Agreement and entered into a series of Lot Purchase Agreements by which NVR would purchase subdivided lots from SeD Maryland Development, LLC (the “Lot Purchase Agreements”).
On April 17, 2019, SeD Maryland Development LLC entered into a Development Loan Agreement with Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (“M&T Bank”) in the principal amount not to exceed at any one time outstanding the sum of $8,000,000, with a cumulative loan advance amount of $18,500,000. The line of credit bears interest of LIBOR plus 375 basis points. SeD Maryland Development LLC was also provided with a Letter of Credit (“L/C”) Facility in an aggregate amount of $900,000. The L/C commission is 1.5% per annum on the face amount of the L/C. Other standard lender fees will apply in the event the L/C is drawn down. The L/C Facility is not a revolving loan, and amounts advanced and repaid may not be re-borrowed. Repayment of the Loan Agreement is secured by $2.6 million collateral fund and a Deed of Trust issued to the Lender on the property owned by SeD Maryland.
LIBOR is expected to be discontinued after 2021. Our line of credit agreement provides procedures for determining a replacement or alternative rate in the event that LIBOR is unavailable. However, there can be no assurances as to whether such replacement or alternative rate will be more or less favorable than LIBOR. We intend to monitor the developments with respect to the potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 and will work with our lenders to ensure any transition away from LIBOR will have minimal impact on our financial condition. We, however, can provide no assurances regarding the impact of the discontinuation of LIBOR on the interest rate that we would be required to pay or on our financial condition.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the principal balance of the loan was $0.
Equity Security Investments
Investment Securities at Fair Value
The Company commonly holds investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values, equity investments without readily determinable fair values, investments accounted for under the equity method, and investments at cost. Certain of the Company’s investments in marketable equity securities and other securities are long-term, strategic investments in companies that are in various stages of development.
Prior to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, investments in equity securities were classified as either 1) available-for-sale securities, stated at fair value, and unrealized holding gains and losses, net of related tax effects, were recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) or 2) trading securities, stated at fair value, and unrealized holding gains and losses, net of related tax benefits, were recorded directly to net income (loss). With the adoption of ASU 2016-01, investments in equity securities are still stated at fair value, quoted by market prices, but all unrealized holding gains and losses are credited or charged to net income (loss) based on fair value measurement as the respective reporting date.
The Company accounts for certain of its investments in equity securities in accordance with ASU 2016-01 Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825- 10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASU 2016-01”). In accordance with ASU 2016-01, the Company records all equity investments with readily determinable fair values at fair value calculated by the publicly traded stock price at the close of the reporting period. Amarantus BioScience Holdings (“AMBS”) and True Partner Capital Holding Limited (“True Partner”) are publicly traded companies. The Company does not have significant influence over AMBS and True Partner as the Company is the beneficial owner of approximately 5.3% of the common shares of AMBS and 15.5% of True Partner. The stock fair value is determined by quoted stock prices.
On April 12, 2021 the Company acquired 6,500,000 common shares of Value Exchange International, Inc. (“Value Exchange International”), an OTC listed company, for an aggregate subscription price of $650,000. After the transaction the Company owns approximately 18% of Value Exchange International and does not have significant influence on it. The stock’s fair value is determined by quoted stock prices.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s subsidiaries established a portfolio of trading securities. The objective is to generate profits on short-term differences in market prices. The Company does not have significant influence over any trading securities in our portfolio and fair value of these trading securities are determined by quoted stock prices.
The Company has elected the fair value option for the equity securities noted below that would otherwise be accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Holista CollTech Limited (“Holista”), DSS Inc. (“DSS”) and American Premium Water Corp (“APW”) are publicly traded companies and fair value is determined by quoted stock prices. The Company has significant influence but does not have a controlling interest in these investments, and therefore, the Company’s investment could be accounted for under the equity method of accounting or elect fair value accounting.
The Company has significant influence over DSS as we owned approximately 24.9% of the common stock of DSS as of December 31, 2021, and our Chief Executive Officer, Chan Heng Fai, is an owner of the common stock of DSS (not including any common or preferred shares we hold). In addition, our Chief Executive Officer is the Chairman of the Board of Directors of DSS. Chan Tung Moe, our Co-Chief Executive Officer and the son of Chan Heng Fai, is also a director of DSS. The Company did not have a controlling interest and therefore the Company’s investment would be accounted for under equity method accounting or could elect the fair value option accounting.
The Company had significant influence over Holista as the Company and its CEO are the beneficial owner of approximately 15.8% of the outstanding shares of Holista and our CEO had a position on the Board of Directors of Holista from July of 2013 until June of 2021. The Company did not have a controlling interest and therefore the Company’s investment would be accounted for under equity method accounting or could elect the fair value option accounting.
The Company has significant influence over APW as the Company is the beneficial owner of approximately 17.5% of the common shares of APW and one officer from the Company holds a director position of APW’s board. The Company did not have a controlling interest and therefore the Company’s investment would be accounted for under equity method accounting or could elect the fair value option accounting.
The Company has elected the fair value options for the equity securities noted above that would otherwise be accounted for under the equity method of accounting to better match the measurement of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. APW, Holista and DSS are publicly traded companies and fair value of these equity investments is determined by the quoted stock prices. On December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair value (calculated by market trading prices on the end dates of the periods) of total held equity stock of American Premium Water, Holista and DSS was $15,632,977 and $10,075,758, respectively.
The Company accounts for certain of its investments in real estate funds without readily determinable fair values in accordance with ASU No. 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) (“ASC 820”).

The changes in the fair values of the investment were recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Due to the inherent uncertainty of these estimates, these values may differ materially from the values that would have been used had a ready market for these investments existed.
Investment Securities at Cost
Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are measured at cost minus impairment adjusted by observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. These investments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when there are events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect. An impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the investment.
The Company had an equity holding of 13.1% in Vivacitas Oncology Inc. (“Vivacitas”), a private company that is currently not listed on an exchange, with a purchase cost of $200,128.

Our ownership in Vivacitas was sold on March 18, 2021 to DSS for $2,480,000. The difference of $2,279,872 between the selling price and our original investment cost was recorded as additional paid capital considering a related party transaction.

There has been no indication of impairment or changes in observable prices via transactions of similar securities and is still carried at a cost.
Investment Securities under Equity Method Accounting
The Company accounts for equity investment in entities with significant influence under equity-method accounting. Under this method, the Group’s pro rata share of income (loss) from investment is recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Dividends received reduce the carrying amount of the investment. When the Company’s share of loss in an equity-method investee equals or exceeds its carrying value of the investment in that entity, the equity method investment can be reduced below zero based on losses if the Company either be liable for the obligations of the investee or provide for losses in excess of the investment when imminent return to profitable operations by the investee appears to be assured. Otherwise, the Company does not recognize its share of equity method losses exceeding its carrying amount of the investment, but discloses the losses in the footnotes. Equity-method investment is reviewed for impairment by assessing if the decline in market value of the investment below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. In making this determination, factors are evaluated in determining whether a loss in value should be recognized. These include consideration of the intent and ability of the Group to hold investment and the ability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity, justifying the carrying amount of the investment. Impairment losses are recognized in other expense when a decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary.
American Medical REIT Inc.
LiquidValue Asset Management Pte. Ltd. (“LiquidValue”), a subsidiary of the Company owns 3.4% of American Medical REIT Inc. (“AMRE”), a startup REIT company concentrating on medical real estate.

See detail in Note 9 to Company’s Financial Statements, Related Party Transactions. On balance sheet, the prorate loss from AMRE was not recorded as a liability because the Company is not liable for the obligations of AMRE and is not committed to provide additional financial support.

The agreement created an entity called Sweet Sense, Inc. (“Sweet Sense”), which was 50% owned by BioLife and 50% owned by QI. Management believes its investment of 50% represents significant influence over Sweet Sense and accounts for the investment under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2018, BioLife had contributed $55,000 to the joint venture and recorded its proportionate share losses totaling $44,053 recorded as loss on investment in security by equity method in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Loss.
On November 8, 2019, Impact BioMedical Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, purchased 50% of Sweet Sense from QI for $91,000 and recorded a loss from acquisition in the amount of $90,001. As of November 8, 2019, the total investment in joint venture was equal to $91,000 and the proportionate losses totaled $90,001. The transaction was not in the scope of ASC 805 Business Combinations since the acquisition was accounted for an asset purchase instead of a business combination. As an asset acquisition, the Company recorded the transaction at cost and applied ASC 730 to expense in-process research and development cost, the major cost of Sweet Sense. Consequently, Sweet Sense was an 81.8% owned subsidiary of Alset International, and therefore, was consolidated into the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020. On August 20, 2020 Impact BioMedical Inc. was sold to one of DSS’s subsidiaries. As a subsidiary of Impact BioMedical Inc., Sweet Sense was in the discontinued operations of Impact BioMedical Inc.
Discontinued Operations
Impact BioMedical Inc.
On April 27, 2020, Global BioMedical Pte Ltd (“GBM”), one of our subsidiaries, entered into a share exchange agreement with DSS BioHealth Security, Inc. (“DBHS”), a wholly owned subsidiary of DSS, Inc. (“DSS”), pursuant to which, DBHS agreed to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of Impact BioMedical Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of GBM, through a share exchange. It was agreed that the aggregate consideration to be issued to GBM for the Impact BioMedical shares would be the following: (i) 483,334 newly issued shares of DSS common stock; and (ii) 46,868 newly issued shares of a new series of DSS perpetual convertible preferred stock with a stated value of $46,868,000, or $1,000 per share. The convertible preferred stock can be convertible into shares of DSS common stock at a conversion price of $6.48 of preferred stock stated value per share of common stock, subject to a 19.9% beneficial ownership conversion limitation (a so-called “blocker”) based on the total issued outstanding shares of common stock of DSS beneficially owned by GBM. Holders of the convertible preferred stock will have no voting rights, except as required by applicable law or regulation, and no dividends will accrue or be payable on the convertible preferred stock. The holders of convertible preferred stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, and DSS will have the right to redeem all or any portion of the then outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock, pro rata among all holders, at a redemption price per share equal to such liquidation value per share.
Under ASU 2014-08, a disposal transaction meets the definition of a discontinued operation if all of the following criteria are met:
1. The disposal group constitutes a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity.
2. The component of an entity (or group of components of an entity) meets the held-for-sale classification criteria, is disposed of by sale, or is disposed of other than by sale (e.g., “by abandonment, in an exchange measured based on the recorded amount of the nonmonetary asset relinquished, or in a distribution to owners in a spinoff”).
3. The disposal of a component of an entity (or group of components of an entity) “represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results”.
Impact BioMedical Inc and its subsidiaries have financial reporting. The transaction is a disposal by sale and has a major effect on our financial results. Since it meets all of the test criteria set forth above, we have treated this disposal transaction as a discontinued operation in our financial statements.
On August 21, 2020, the transaction closed and Impact BioMedical Inc became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of DBHS. GBM received 483,334 shares of DSS common stock and 46,868 shares of DSS preferred stock, which preferred shares could be converted to 7,232,716 common shares (however, any conversion will be subject to the blocker GBM has agreed to, as described above). After this transaction, we held 500,001 shares of the common stock of DSS, representing 9.7% of the outstanding common stock of DSS. Our CEO, Chan Heng Fai is the owner of the common stock of DSS (not including any common or preferred shares we held) and is the executive chairman of the board of directors of DSS. The Company has elected the fair value option for the DSS common stock that would otherwise be accounted for under the equity method of accounting. ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, defines the fair value of the financial assets. We value DSS common stock under level 1 category through quoted prices and preferred stock under level 2 category through the value of the common shares into which the preferred shares are convertible. The quoted price of DSS common stock was $6.95 as of August 21, 2020. The total fair value of DSS common and preferred stocks GBM received as consideration for the disposal of Impact BioMedical was $46,284,171. As of August 21, 2020, the net asset value of Impact BioMedical was $94,011. The difference of $46,190,160 was recorded as additional paid in capital. We did not recognize gain or loss from this transaction as it was a related party transaction.
On October 16, 2020, GBM converted an aggregate of 4,293 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into 662,500 shares of the common stock of DSS. On May 25, 2021 and again on June 21, 2021, GBM converted an aggregate of 42,575 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into 6,570,170 shares of the common stock of DSS. On September 3, 2021, the Company purchased additional 12,155,591 common shares of DSS. We now own approximately 24.9% of the common stock of DSS, and our CEO, Chan Heng Fai, owns an additional 3.1% of the common stock of DSS (not including any common shares we hold).
Investment in Debt Securities

Realized gains and losses on debt securities are recognized in the net income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The Company monitors its investments for other-than-temporary impairment by considering factors including, but not limited to, current economic and market conditions, the operating performance of the companies including current earnings trends and other company-specific information.
The Company invested $50,000 in a convertible promissory note of Sharing Services Global Corporation (“Sharing Services Convertible Note”), a company quoted on the US OTC market.

The interest rate is 2% per annum and maturity is two years. The conversion price is approximately $21.26 per common share of Vector Com. As of December 31, 2021, the Management estimated the fair value of the note to be $88,599, the initial transaction price.
Variable Interest Entity
Under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 810, Consolidation, when a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of an entity that is a variable interest entity (“VIE”), as defined in ASC 810, the VIE must be consolidated into the financial statements of the reporting entity. The determination of which owner is the primary beneficiary of a VIE requires management to make significant estimates and judgments about the rights, obligations, and economic interests of each interest holder in the VIE.
The Company evaluates its interests in VIE’s on an ongoing basis and consolidates any VIE in which it has a controlling financial interest and is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. A controlling financial interest has both of the following characteristics: (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to it or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE.
HWH World Company Limited
HWH World Co. is a direct sales company in Thailand. The Company has a 19% ownership and lent a loan of $187,500 with zero interest and due on demand, to HWH World Co. The current level of equity in HWH World Co. is not sufficient to permit it to operate on its own without additional subordinated financial support. The Company has a variable interest in HWH World Co. However, the Company is not deemed to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to HWH World Co. Ltd. Moreover, the Company does not have the ultimate power over the activities which can impact VIE’s economic performance, like developing company budgets or overseeing and controlling the management. The power to direct the activities are held by the manager in Thailand who owns 51% of the HWH World Co. Therefore, the Company is not a primary beneficiary of this VIE and does not consolidate it. On December 31, 2021 and 2020 variable interest and amount receivable in the non-consolidated VIE was $236,699 and $42,562, respectively, which represents the Company’s maximum risk of loss from non-consolidated VIE. The Company applied ASC 321 and measured HWH World Co. investment at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.
American Medical REIT Inc.
The Company has less than 3.4% ownership in AMRE and lent two loans of $200,000 each and one loan of $8,350,000, all with 8% per annum interest rate. One of the $200,000 loans is due on March 3, 2022, the other one is due on October 29, 2024. The $8,350,000 loan is due one on November 29, 2023. The Company has a variable interest in AMRE. However, The Company is not deemed to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to AMRE. The Company does not also have the ultimate power over the activities which can impact VIE’s economic performance, like developing company budgets or overseen and controlling the management. The power to direct these activities are held by the AMRE’s largest shareholder which owns approximately 93% of AMRE and AMRE’s management team. Therefore, the Company is not a primary beneficiary of this VIE and does not consolidate it. On December 31, 2021 and 2020 variable interest and amount receivable in the non-consolidated VIE was $8,901,285 and $213,431, respectively, which represents the Company’s maximum risk of loss from non-consolidated VIE.
Credas Capital Pte Ltd
The Company has a 50% ownership of Credas Capital Pte Ltd (“Credas”) and lent a loan of $135,720 with zero interest rate and due on demand. The current level of equity in Credas is not sufficient to permit if to operate on its own without additional subordinated financial support. The Company has a variable interest in Credas. However, the Company is not deemed to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to Credas. Moreover, the Company does not have the ultimate power over the activities which can impact VIE’s economic performance, like developing company budgets or overseen and controlling the management. Therefore, the Company is not a primary beneficiary of this VIE and does not consolidate it. On December 31, 2021 and 2020 variable interest and amount receivable in the non-consolidated VIE was $135,720 and $0, respectively, which represents the Company’s maximum risk of loss from non-consolidated VIE.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures.
Impact of Inflation
We believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. We cannot assure you that future inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.
Impact of Foreign Exchange Rates
The effect of foreign exchange rate changes on the intercompany loans (under ASC 830), which mostly consist of loans from Singapore to the United States and which were approximately $43 million and $25 million on December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, are the reason for the significant fluctuation of foreign currency transaction Gain or Loss on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income. Because the intercompany loan balances between Singapore and United States will remain at approximately $43 million over the next year, we expect this fluctuation of foreign exchange rates to still significantly impact the results of operations in the year 2022, especially given that the foreign exchange rate may and is expected to be volatile. If the amount of intercompany loan is lowered in the future, the effect will also be reduced. However, at this moment, we do not expect to repay the intercompany loans in the short term.
Emerging Growth Company Status
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies.” Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company or until we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of this exemption.
Controls and Procedures
We are not currently required to maintain an effective system of internal controls as defined by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event that we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer would we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement. Further, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement.
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements included in this Report. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and reflect management’s judgment and estimates concerning effects of events and transactions that are accounted for or disclosed.
Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to our ability to record, process, summarize and report reliable data. Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement presentation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.
In order to ensure that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, management regularly assesses controls and did so most recently for its financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in the Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. In connection with management’s evaluation of the effectiveness of our company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, management determined that our company did not maintain effective controls over financial reporting due to having a limited staff. This limited number of staff prevents us from segregating duties within our internal control system; and restricts our ability to timely evaluate the accuracy and completeness of our financial statement disclosures. Management determined that the ineffective controls over financial reporting constitute a material weakness. To remediate such weaknesses, we plan to appoint additional qualified personnel with financial accounting, GAAP and SEC experience.
This Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management’s report in this Report.
