Overview
We manufacture high water content, electron beam cross-linked, aqueous polymer hydrogels, or gels, used for wound care, medical diagnostics, transdermal drug delivery and cosmetics. We specialize in custom gels by capitalizing on proprietary manufacturing technologies. We have historically served as a contract manufacturer, supplying our gels to third parties who incorporate them into their own products and have recently began producing our own consumer products using our gels focused on proprietary branded products and white label opportunities. Both our gels and our consumer products are manufactured using proprietary and non-proprietary mixing, coating and cross-linking technologies. Together, these technologies enable us to produce gels that can satisfy rigid tolerance specifications with respect to a wide range of physical characteristics (e.g., thickness, water content, adherence, absorption, moisture vapor transmission rate [a measure of the passage of water vapor through a substance] and release rate) while maintaining product integrity. Additionally, we have the manufacturing ability to offer broad choices in the selection of liners onto which the gels are coated. Consequently, we and our customers are able to determine tolerances in moisture vapor transmission rate and active ingredient release rates while personalizing color and texture.
Initial Public Offering
On December 27, 2021, the Company sold an aggregate of 2,585,000 units at a price to the public of $5.50 per unit (the “Offering”), each unit consisting of one share of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”), and a warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $5.50 per share (the “Warrants”), pursuant to that certain Underwriting Agreement, dated as of December 21, 2021 (the “Underwriting Agreement”), between the Company and Maxim Group LLC (the “Underwriter”).

It also provides for customary indemnification by each of the Company and the underwriters for losses or damages arising out of or in connection with the offering, including for liabilities under the Securities Act, other obligations of the parties and termination provisions.
Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Company also agreed to issue to the Underwriter warrants (the “Underwriter’s Warrants”) to purchase up to a total of 155,100 shares of Common Stock (6% of the shares of Common Stock sold in the Offering). The Underwriter’s Warrants are exercisable at $6.1875 per share of Common Stock and have a term of five years.

Proceeds from these offering are expected to be used for working capital, new product development and testing, and general business operations.
We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. For the foreseeable future, we anticipate that all available fund and any earnings generated in our business will be used to finance the growth of our business and will not be paid out as dividends to our shareholders. Any future determination related to our dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, business prospects and other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant.
Management is exploring new product channel sales in consumer products, such as cosmetics, athletic products, and proprietary medical devices. The Company has increased its focus on sales and developing a sales pipeline for potential customers. This customer base expansion will enable us to provide financial stability for the foreseeable future, expand our current processes, and position us for long-term shareholder value creation.
We have sufficient capital to maintain as a going concern due to the capital raise that occurred on December 27, 2021. We intend to maintain and attempt to grow our existing contract manufacturing business. We also plan to continue building and developing its catalog of consumer products for sale to branding partners and to use our in-house capabilities to create and test market additional branded products. These products will be target marketed and sold online through social media, television and online marketplaces. Furthermore, the Company plans to develop its own proprietary medical devices and explore drug delivery programs for its technology. Additionally, the Company continues to evaluate strategic initiatives (e.g., acquisitions) and additional capital raises through debt or equity may be necessary to achieve these objectives.
We expect to continue incurring losses for the near-term future. Our ability to continue to operate as a going concern in the long-term is dependent upon our ability to manage and grow our current products and to ultimately achieve profitable operations. Management may consider various options to raise capital to fund potential acquisitions through equity or debt offerings. There can be no assurances, however, that management will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds, if needed, or that such funds, if available, will be obtained on terms satisfactory to us. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets and liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
Additionally, it is reasonably possible that estimates made in the financial statements have been, or will be, materially and adversely impacted in the near term as a result of these conditions, including the recoverability of long-lived assets.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2021, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to entities (or similar arrangements serving as credit, liquidity or market risk support to entities for any such assets), or obligations (including contingent obligations) arising out of variable interests in entities providing financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Share-based compensation - We utilize share-based compensation in the form of incentive stock options. The fair values of incentive stock option award grants are estimated as of the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. Compensation expense is recognized in the statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period required to obtain full vesting. The expected term of the awards granted is estimated using the simplified method which computes the expected term as the sum of the award’s vesting term plus the original contractual term divided by two.
Warrant Liability - Warrants to purchase common stock were issued in connection with equity financing raises which occurred on September 2, 2021, March 11, 2021, February 3, 2021, December 24, 2020, March 18, 2020, September 10, 2019 and November 6, 2019. The fair values of the warrants are estimated as of the date of issuance and again at each period end using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. At issuance, the fair value of the warrant is recognized as an equity issuance cost within additional paid-in-capital. Fair value adjustments to the warrant liability are recognized in other income (expense) in the statements of operations. The expected term of the awards granted are based on either the three-year or five-year contractual expiration date.
Black Scholes Inputs - The fair value of each stock option award and warrant issued was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-valuation model, which requires management to make certain assumptions regarding: (i) fair value of the common stock that underlies the stock option; (ii) the expected volatility in the market price of our common stock; (iii) dividend yield; (iv) risk-free interest rates; and (iv) the period of time employees are expected to hold the award prior to exercise (referred to as the expected term). Under the Black-Scholes option-valuation model, entities typically estimate the expected volatility based on historical volatilities of the entity’s own common stock. Based on the lack of historical data of volatility for the Company’s common stock, the Company based its estimate of expected volatility on a weighted average of the historical volatility of comparable public companies that manufacture similar products and are similar in size, stage of life cycle, and financial leverage. The fair value of the common stock that
underlies the stock option is estimated by the Company considering the price of the most recent issuance of the Company’s common stock. The dividend yield is based upon the assumption that the Company will not declare a dividend over the life of the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for bonds with maturities consistent with the expected term of the related award.
