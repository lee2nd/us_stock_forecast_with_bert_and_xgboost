ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.
We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional funds through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities although no assurance can be given as to availability of funds or the terms thereof.
We are both currently and generally exploring options which will bring value to our shareholders and are in early stage discussions with a number of potential acquisition targets. Management resolves to provide updates on these efforts at the earliest such time that they become tangible.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash flow used in Operating Activities.
We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. During the year ended March 31, 2022, the Company used $396,238 of cash for operating activities compared to $342,361 of cash for operating activities in the prior period.

During the year ended March 31, 2021 the Company received $559,490 of cash from financing activities offset by payments of $20,000 to settle loans payable to related parties.
PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING
We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds, advances from shareholders and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.
Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next six months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business); (ii) acquisition of assets; and (iii) sales and marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.
