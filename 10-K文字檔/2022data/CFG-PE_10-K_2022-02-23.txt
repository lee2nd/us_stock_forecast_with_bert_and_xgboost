Headquartered in Providence, Rhode Island, we offer a broad range of retail and commercial banking products and services to individuals, small businesses, middle-market companies, large corporations, and institutions. We help our customers reach their potential by listening to them and by understanding their needs to offer tailored advice, ideas and solutions. In Consumer Banking, we provide an integrated experience that includes mobile and online banking, a 24/7 customer contact center, the convenience of approximately 3,000 ATMs and approximately 900 branches in 11 states in the New England, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwest regions. Consumer Banking products and services include a full range of banking, lending, savings, wealth management and small business offerings. In Commercial Banking, we offer a broad complement of financial products and solutions, including lending and leasing, deposit and treasury management services, foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity risk management solutions, as well as loan syndication, corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, and debt and equity capital markets capabilities. More information is available at www.citizensbank.com.
On May 26, 2021, CBNA entered into an agreement to acquire 80 East Coast branches and the national online deposit business from HSBC. The HSBC branch acquisition provides an attractive entry into important metro markets and supports our national expansion strategy. The acquisition closed on February 18, 2022.
On July 28, 2021 Citizens entered into a definitive agreement and a plan of merger under which we will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Investors for a combination of stock and cash. The acquisition of Investors enhances Citizens’ banking franchise, adding an attractive middle market, small business and consumer customer base while building our physical presence in the northeast with the addition of 154 branches located in the greater New York City and Philadelphia metropolitan areas and across New Jersey. The merger is expected to close in early second quarter 2022, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
For more information regarding these pending acquisitions, see Note 2 in Item 8.
The following MD&A is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and supplemental financial information. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, as well as other information contained in this document.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This document contains non-GAAP financial measures denoted as “Underlying,” “excluding PPP loans”, as well as other results excluding the impact of certain items. Underlying results for any given reporting period exclude certain items that may occur in that period which management does not consider indicative of our on-going financial performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they are used by management to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions. In addition, we believe our Underlying results or results excluding the impact of certain items in any given reporting period reflect our on-going financial performance and increase comparability of period-to-period results, and, accordingly, are useful to consider in addition to our GAAP financial results.
Other companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. Accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by such companies. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP financial measures, but to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under GAAP.
Non-GAAP measures are denoted throughout our MD&A by the use of the term Underlying or identified as excluding the impact of certain items. Where there is a reference to these metrics in that paragraph, all measures that follow are on the same basis when applicable. For more information on the computation of non-GAAP financial measures, see “-Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations.”

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Key Highlights
Net income of $2.3 billion increased 119% from 2020, with earnings per diluted common share of $5.16, up 132% from $2.22 per diluted common share for 2020. ROTCE of 15.4% increased from 6.9% in 2020. Improved results primarily reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns during 2020, resulting in a significant ACL reserve build during 2020.
In 2021, results reflect $78 million of expenses, net of tax benefit, or $0.18 per diluted common share, from notable items compared to $83 million of expenses, net of tax benefit, or $0.19 per diluted common share, from notable items in 2020.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2021 compared with 2020
Net Interest Income
Net interest income is our largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interest-earning assets (generally loans, leases and investment securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (generally deposits and borrowed funds). The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on our average interest-earning assets and the effective cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. These factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the FRB and market interest rates. For further discussion, refer to “-Market Risk - Non-Trading Risk,” and “-Risk Governance.”
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 41
(1) Net interest income and net interest margin is presented on FTE basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 21%. The FTE impact is predominantly attributable to commercial and industrial loans for the periods presented.
Net interest income of $4.5 billion decreased $74 million, reflecting a 17 basis point decrease in net interest margin given the lower rate and challenging yield curve environment, partially offset by 5% average interest-earning asset growth, improvements in funding mix and deposit pricing and a higher benefit from PPP loan forgiveness.
Net interest margin on a FTE basis of 2.72% decreased 17 basis points compared to 2.89% in 2020, primarily reflecting the impact of lower interest rates and elevated cash balances given strong deposit flows, partially offset by improved funding mix and deposit pricing and the benefit of PPP forgiveness. Average interest-earning asset yields of 2.90% decreased 45 basis points from 3.35% in 2020, while average interest-bearing liability costs of 0.30% decreased 39 basis points from 0.69% in 2020.
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 42
Average interest-earning assets of $166.5 billion increased $7.2 billion, or 5%, from 2020, primarily driven by an $8.0 billion increase in total investment securities and interest-bearing cash and due from banks and deposits in banks, and a $2.3 billion increase in average retail loans, partially offset by a $3.3 billion decrease in average commercial loans. Retail loan growth was driven by education, residential mortgage and automobile, partially offset by other retail and home equity. Commercial decreases were driven by commercial and industrial loans and leases.
Average deposits of $150.5 billion increased $11.7 billion from 2020, as a result of elevated liquidity tied to government stimulus associated with the COVID-19 disruption. Growth in demand deposits, money market accounts, savings, and checking with interest, were partially offset by a decrease in term deposits. Total interest-bearing deposit costs of $160 million decreased $349 million, or 69%, from $509 million in 2020, primarily due to the lower rate environment and strong pricing discipline.
Average total borrowed funds of $7.5 billion decreased $3.7 billion from 2020 reflecting the pay down of senior debt and short-term borrowings given strong customer deposit inflows. Total borrowed funds costs of $179 million decreased $83 million from 2020. Total borrowed funds cost of 2.38% increased 5 basis points from 2.33% in 2020.
(1) Volume and rate changes have been allocated on a consistent basis using the respective percentage changes in average balances and average rates.
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 43
Noninterest Income
(1) Includes bank-owned life insurance income and other income for all periods presented.
Noninterest income of $2.1 billion decreased $184 million, or 8%, from 2020, reflecting lower mortgage banking fees partially offset by improved capital markets fees, trust and investment services fees, letter of credit and loan fees, card fees and service charge and fees.
•Capital markets fees increased driven by loan syndication, underwriting, and mergers and acquisitions advisory fees, notably to record levels in the fourth quarter of 2021.
•Trust and investment services fees increased driven by an increase in assets under management from higher equity market levels and strong inflows.
•Letter of credit and loan fees increased reflecting higher commitment fees.
•Card fees and service charges and fees increased largely tied to economic recovery.
•Mortgage banking fees decreased reflecting increased industry capacity and heightened competition resulting in lower gain-on-sale margins.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense of $4.1 billion increased $90 million, or 2%, compared to 2020, reflecting higher equipment and software given continued investment in technology and outside services tied to growth initiatives.
Provision for Credit Losses
The provision for credit losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate our ACL. The total provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded commitments. Refer to “-Analysis of Financial Condition - Allowance for Credit Losses and Nonaccrual Loans and Leases” for more information.
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 44
The credit provision benefit of $411 million reflects strong credit performance and an improving macroeconomic outlook. Net charge-offs of $325 million decreased $368 million from 2020, driven by decreases in commercial and retail of $261 million and $107 million, respectively. The decrease in commercial reflected the economic recovery following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns, whereas the decrease in retail was due to U.S. Government stimulus programs and strong collateral values in residential real estate and automobile. The combination of the credit provision benefit and net charge-offs resulted in a reduction in our ACL of $736 million in 2021.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense of $658 million increased $417 million from $241 million in 2020. The 2021 effective tax rate of 22.1% increased from 18.5% in 2020, driven by the decreased benefit of tax-advantaged investments on higher pre-tax income. An Underlying effective tax rate of 22.2% in 2021 compared to 19.9% in 2020.
Business Operating Segments
We have two business operating segments: Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. Segment results are derived by specifically attributing managed assets, liabilities, capital and related revenues, provision for credit losses, which at the segment level is equal to net charge-offs, and other expenses. The residual difference between the consolidated provision for credit losses and the business operating segments’ net charge-offs is reflected in Other.
Non-segment operations includes assets, liabilities, capital, revenues, provision for credit losses, expenses and income tax expense not attributed to our Consumer or Commercial Banking segments as well as treasury and community development. In addition, Other includes goodwill not directly allocated to a business operating segment and any associated goodwill impairment charges. For impairment testing purposes, we allocate all goodwill to our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking reporting units.
Our capital levels are evaluated and managed centrally; however, capital is allocated on a risk-adjusted basis to the business operating segments to support evaluation of business performance. Because funding and asset liability management is a central function, funds transfer-pricing (“FTP”) methodologies are utilized to allocate a cost of funds used, or credit for the funds provided, to all business operating segment assets, liabilities and capital, respectively, using a matched-funding concept. The residual effect on net interest income of asset/liability management, including the residual net interest income related to the FTP process, is included in Other. We periodically evaluate and refine our methodologies used to measure financial performance of our business operating segments.
Noninterest income and expense are directly attributed to each business operating segment, including fees, service charges, salaries and benefits, and other direct revenues and costs and are respectively accounted for in a manner similar to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Occupancy costs are allocated based on utilization of facilities by each business operating segment. Noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business operating segments that directly support another business operating segment’s operations are charged to the applicable business operating segment based on its utilization of those services.
Income tax expense is assessed to each business operating segment at a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in Other.
Developing and applying methodologies used to allocate items among the business operating segments is a dynamic process. Accordingly, financial results may be revised periodically as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines are updated, or our organizational structure changes.
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 45
The following table presents certain financial data of our business operating segments. Total business operating segment financial results differ from total consolidated net income. These differences are reflected in Other non-segment operations. See Note 26 in Item 8 for further information.
(1) Includes LHFS.
(2) The majority of PPP loans are reflected in Consumer Banking in accordance with how they are managed.
Consumer Banking
Net interest income increased $251 million, or 8%, from 2020, driven by the benefit of a $2.9 billion increase in average loans led by residential mortgages, automobile and education, as well as the impact of the PPP loan program. Additionally, higher deposit volumes were offset by improved funding mix and deposit pricing. Noninterest income decreased $432 million, or 26%, from 2020, driven by a decrease in mortgage banking fees attributable to increased industry capacity and heightened competition resulting in lower gain-on-sale margins, partially offset by higher card fees driven by higher debit and credit card volumes given the economic recovery and trust and investment services fees reflecting an increase in assets under management from higher equity market levels and strong net inflows. Noninterest expense increased $23 million, or 1%, from 2020, reflecting higher outside services tied to growth initiatives. Net charge-offs of $185 million decreased $103 million, or 36%, driven by the impact of U.S. Government stimulus programs and forbearance, as well as strong collateral values in residential real estate and automobile.
Commercial Banking
Net interest income of $1.7 billion increased $63 million, or 4%, from 2020, as the $3.2 billion decrease in average loans was offset by improved funding mix and deposit pricing on higher deposit volumes. Noninterest income of $809 million increased $214 million, or 36%, from $595 million in 2020, driven by a record increase in capital markets fees reflecting higher mergers and acquisitions advisory and loan syndication fees. Noninterest expense of $973 million increased $113 million, from $860 million in 2020, driven by higher salaries and employee benefits reflecting revenue-based compensation. Net charge-offs of $156 million decreased $242 million from 2020, reflecting improving economic conditions following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2020 compared with 2019
For a description of our results of operations for 2020, see the “Results of Operations - 2020 compared with 2019” section of Item 7 in our 2020 Form 10-K.

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
Securities
Our securities portfolio is managed to maintain prudent levels of liquidity, credit quality and market risk while achieving returns that align with our overall portfolio management strategy. The portfolio primarily includes high quality, highly liquid investments reflecting our ongoing commitment to maintain strong contingent liquidity levels and pledging capacity. U.S. government-guaranteed notes and GSE-issued mortgage-backed securities represent 92% of the fair value of our debt securities portfolio holdings at December 31, 2021. Holdings backed by mortgages dominate our portfolio and facilitate our ability to pledge those securities to the FHLB for collateral purposes.
The fair value of the AFS debt securities portfolio of $26.1 billion at December 31, 2021 increased $3.1 billion from $22.9 billion at December 31, 2020, including $3.9 billion in portfolio growth, offset by a $736 million reduction in unrealized gains driven by a steepening yield curve. The fair value of the HTM debt securities portfolio decreased $1.1 billion largely reflecting portfolio runoff.
As of December 31, 2021, the portfolio’s average effective duration was 4.3 years compared with 2.7 years as of December 31, 2020, as higher long-term rates drove a decrease in both actual and projected securities prepayment speeds. We manage our securities portfolio duration and convexity risk through asset selection and securities structure, and maintain duration levels within our risk appetite in the context of the broader interest rate risk framework and limits.
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 47
(1) Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without incurring penalties.
(2) The weighted-average yield is computed based on a constant effective interest rate over the contractual life of each security and considers the contractual
coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Yields exclude the impact of related hedging derivatives.
Loans and Leases
(1) Includes PPP loans fully guaranteed by the SBA of $787 million and $4.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Total loans and leases increased $5.1 billion, or 4%, from $123.1 billion as of December 31, 2020, reflecting a $5.5 billion increase in retail driven by growth in mortgage and automobile, and a $443 million decrease in commercial as underlying growth was more than offset by a $3.4 billion decrease in PPP loans.
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 48
(1) Includes $16.3 billion of floating-rate commercial loans hedged to fixed rate to manage our exposure to the variability in interest cash flows.
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 49
Allowance for Credit Losses and Nonaccrual Loans and Leases
The ACL is created through charges to the provision for credit losses in order to provide appropriate reserves to absorb estimated future credit losses in accordance with GAAP. For additional information regarding the ACL, see “-Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Credit Losses,” and Note 6 in Item 8.
The ACL of $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2021 compared with the ACL of $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2020, reflecting a reserve release of $736 million. For further information, see Note 6.
(1) Coverage ratio includes total commercial allowance for unfunded lending commitments and total commercial allowance for loan and lease losses in the numerator and total commercial loans and leases in the denominator.
(2) Coverage ratio includes total retail allowance for unfunded lending commitments and total retail allowance for loan losses in the numerator and total retail loans in the denominator.
(3) Excluding the impact of PPP loans, the ACL Coverage Ratio would have been 1.52% and 2.24% for December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. For more information on the computation of non-GAAP financial measures, see “-Introduction - Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “-Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations.”
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 50
(1) Loans fully or partially guaranteed by the FHA, VA or USDA are classified as accruing.
Nonaccrual loans and leases of $702 million as of December 31, 2021 decreased $317 million from December 31, 2020, reflecting a $42 million decrease in retail and a $275 million decrease in commercial. As of December 31, 2021, total commercial nonaccrual loans and leases were 0.3% of the commercial portfolio and decreased from 0.8% at December 31, 2020. Commercial nonaccrual loans and leases decreased through loan sale activity, repayments and charge-offs.
NCOs of $325 million decreased $368 million, or 53%, from $693 million in 2020, driven by decreases in commercial and retail of $261 million and $107 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, annualized NCOs as a percentage of total average loans and leases of 0.26% decreased 30 basis points compared to 0.56% in 2020.
The decline in retail NCOs is primarily due to U.S. Government stimulus programs and forbearance, as well as strong collateral values in residential real estate and automobile. The decrease in commercial NCOs reflects the economic recovery following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns. We continue to assess risks to the recovery, including potential for continuing impacts from COVID-19 variants, challenges in the global supply chain and recent inflationary trends, as well as potential impacts from ending monetary and fiscal stimulus programs. We have maintained a variety of measures to identify and monitor areas of potential risk, including direct outreach to commercial clients and close monitoring of retail credit metrics.
Commercial Loan Asset Quality
Our commercial portfolio consists of traditional commercial and industrial loans, commercial leases and commercial real estate loans. The portfolio is predominantly focused on customers in our footprint and adjacent
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 51
states in which we have a physical presence where our local delivery model provides for strong client connectivity. Additionally, we also do business in certain specialized industry sectors on a national basis.
For commercial, we utilize regulatory classification ratings to monitor credit quality. For more information on regulatory classification ratings, see Note 6 in Item 8. The recorded investment in commercial based on regulatory classification ratings is presented below:
(1) Includes $787 million and $4.2 billion of PPP loans designated as pass that are fully guaranteed by the SBA as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Total commercial criticized balances of $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2021 decreased $1.4 billion compared with December 31, 2020. Commercial criticized as a percent of total commercial of 5.4% at December 31, 2021 decreased from 7.6% at December 31, 2020.
Commercial and industrial criticized balances of $2.2 billion, or 5.0% of the total commercial and industrial loan portfolio as of December 31, 2021, decreased from $3.3 billion, or 7.5%, as of December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by repayments and net charge-offs. Commercial and industrial criticized loans represented 69% of total criticized loans as of December 31, 2021 compared to 71% as of December 31, 2020.
Commercial real estate criticized balances of $945 million, or 6.6% of the commercial real estate portfolio as of December 31, 2021, decreased from $1.3 billion, or 8.8%, as of December 31, 2020. The decrease was due to repayments and the migration to Pass for a few borrowers. Commercial real estate accounted for 29% of total criticized loans as of December 31, 2021 compared to 28% as of December 31, 2020.
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 52
(1) During 2021, our industry sectors were re-aligned to better reflect sector management and associated risks. Prior period has been adjusted to conform with the current period presentation.
(2) Deferred fees and costs are reported in All other.
(3) Excludes PPP loans of $787 million and $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Retail Loan Asset Quality
For retail loans, we utilize credit scores provided by FICO which are generally refreshed on a quarterly basis and the loan’s payment and delinquency status to monitor credit quality. Management believes FICO credit scores are considered the strongest indicator of credit losses over the contractual life of the loan as the scores are based on current and historical national industry-wide consumer level credit performance data, and assist management in predicting the borrower’s future payment performance. The largest portion of the retail portfolio is represented by borrowers located in the New England, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions, although we have continued to lend selectively in areas outside the footprint primarily in auto finance and education lending.
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 53
(1) 90+ days past due and accruing includes $544 million and $21 million of loans fully or partially guaranteed by the FHA, VA, and USDA at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
(2) Beginning in 2021, nonaccrual loans and leases are no longer aged relative to their delinquency status. Prior period has been adjusted to conform with the current period presentation.
For more information on the aging of accruing and nonaccrual retail loans, see Note 6 in Item 8.
(1) The real estate secured portfolio CLTV is calculated as the mortgage and second lien loan balance divided by the most recently available value of the property.
Troubled Debt Restructurings
TDR is the classification given to a loan that has been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial hardship that we would not otherwise make. TDRs typically result from our loss mitigation efforts and are undertaken in order to improve the likelihood of recovery and continuity of the relationship. Our loan modifications are handled on a case-by-case basis and are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan collectability and meet our borrower’s financial needs. The types of concessions include interest rate reductions, term extensions, principal forgiveness and other modifications to the structure of the loan that fall outside our lending policy. Depending on the specific facts and circumstances of the customer, restructuring can involve loans moving to nonaccrual, remaining on nonaccrual, or remaining on accrual status.
In the first quarter of 2020, we adopted the CARES Act and interagency guidance issued by the bank regulatory agencies which provide that COVID-19-related modifications to retail and commercial loans that met certain eligibility criteria are exempt from classification as a TDR. We generally do not consider payment deferrals and forbearance plans established due to the COVID-19 pandemic and under the CARES Act to be TDRs. Relief provisions granted under the CARES Act, including the TDR classification exemption for certain eligible loans, expired on December 31, 2021, and therefore any subsequent COVID-19-related loan modifications will likely be classified as TDRs.
TDRs generally return to accrual status once repayment capacity and appropriate payment history can be established. TDRs are individually evaluated for impairment and loans, once classified as TDRs, remain classified as TDRs until paid off, sold or refinanced at market terms. For additional information regarding TDRs, see Note 6 in Item 8.
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 54
(1) Includes $98 million and $14 million in 90+ days past due and accruing that are fully or partially guaranteed by the FHA, VA, and USDA at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Deposits
Total deposits as of December 31, 2021, increased $7.2 billion, or 5%, driven by growth in demand, checking with interest and savings, partially offset by a decrease in money market accounts and terms deposits. Citizens Access®, our national digital platform, attracted $4.4 billion of deposits through December 31, 2021, down from $5.9 billion as of December 31, 2020.
Total estimated uninsured deposits, including demand, checking with interest, savings, money market accounts and term deposits, are $77.9 billion and $73.4 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 55
(1) Includes term deposits per account in excess of $250,000.
Borrowed Funds
Our advances, lines of credit and letters of credit from the FHLB are collateralized primarily by residential mortgages and home equity products at least sufficient to satisfy the collateral maintenance level established by the FHLB. The utilized borrowing capacity for FHLB advances and letters of credit was $2.3 billion and $3.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our remaining available FHLB borrowing capacity was $15.9 billion and $13.9 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We can also borrow from the FRB discount window to meet short-term liquidity requirements. Collateral, including certain loans, is pledged to support this borrowing capacity. At December 31, 2021, our unused secured borrowing capacity was approximately $63.0 billion, which includes unencumbered securities, FHLB borrowing capacity, and FRB discount window capacity.

CAPITAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS
As a bank holding company and a financial holding company, we are subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB. Our banking subsidiary, CBNA, is a national banking association whose primary federal regulator is the OCC. Our regulation and supervision continues to evolve as the legal and regulatory frameworks governing our operations continue to change. For more information, see the “Regulation and Supervision” section in Item 1.
Tailoring of Prudential Requirements
Under the FRB’s Tailoring Rules, Category IV firms, such as us, are subject to biennial supervisory stress testing and are exempt from company-run stress testing and related disclosure requirements. The FRB supervises Category IV firms on an ongoing basis, including evaluation of the capital adequacy and capital planning processes during off-cycle years. Annually, the FRB requires us to submit a capital plan approved by our board of directors or one of its committees. On April 2, 2021, we submitted our 2021 Capital Plan to the FRB under the FRB’s 2021 CCAR process. For more information, see the “Tailoring of Prudential Requirements” section in Item 1.
Under the FRB’s Capital Plan Rule, a firm must update and resubmit its capital plan prior to the next annual submission date under certain circumstances, which includes a material change in the firm’s risk profile, financial condition or corporate structure since its last capital plan submission. On July 28, 2021, we announced an agreement to acquire Investors, requiring us to resubmit our capital plan to the FRB. We submitted our updated capital plan on September 15, 2021.
Under the stress capital buffer (“SCB”) framework, the FRB will not object to capital plans on quantitative grounds and each firm is required to maintain capital ratios above the sum of its minimum and SCB requirements to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments.
Effective April 5, 2021, the FRB adopted a final rule to make conforming changes to its Capital Plan Rule and stress capital buffer and capital planning requirements to be consistent with the Tailoring Rules framework. Under the final rule, for Category IV firms, like us, the SCB will be re-calibrated with each biennial supervisory stress test and updated annually to reflect our planned common stock dividends. In addition, Category IV firms may elect to participate in the supervisory stress test and receive an updated SCB requirement in a year in which they are not subject to the supervisory stress test. We did not elect to participate in the 2021 supervisory stress test and on August 5, 2021, the FRB announced that our SCB will remain unchanged at 3.4% from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022.
In light of the heightened uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns, the FRB took certain actions to preserve capital at banks beginning in the third quarter of 2020 through the second quarter of 2021. Beginning July 1, 2021, the FRB lifted all temporary restrictions on capital distributions and authorized firms, like us, that are on a two-year cycle and not subject to supervisory stress testing in 2021 to make capital distributions that are consistent with the regulatory capital rules, including normal restrictions under the FRB stress capital buffer framework. In addition, we temporarily suspended share repurchases in connection with entering into the agreement to acquire Investors. We resumed share repurchases after the Investors shareholder vote on November 19, 2021. In January 2021, our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to $750 million of our common stock, of which $455 million is available as of December 31, 2021. All future capital distributions are subject to consideration and approval by our board of directors prior to execution. The timing and amount of future dividends and share repurchases will depend on various factors, including our capital position, financial performance, risk-weighted assets, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions and regulatory considerations.
Regulations relating to capital planning, regulatory reporting, stress testing and capital buffer requirements applicable to firms like us are presently subject to rule-making and potential further guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators. We will continue to evaluate the impact of these and any other prudential regulatory changes, including their potential resultant changes in our regulatory and compliance costs and expenses.
For more information, see the “Regulation and Supervision” section in Item 1.

Capital Framework
Under the current U.S. Basel III capital framework, we and our banking subsidiary, CBNA, must meet the following specific minimum requirements: CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, total capital ratio of 8.0% and tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. As a bank holding company, our SCB of 3.4% is imposed on top of the three minimum risk-based capital ratios listed above and a CCB of 2.5% is imposed on top of the three minimum risk-based capital ratios listed above for our banking subsidiary.
Under the U.S. Basel III rules, the CET1 deduction threshold for MSRs, certain deferred tax assets and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions is 25%. As of December 31, 2021, we did not meet the threshold for these additional capital deductions. MSRs or certain deferred tax assets not deducted from CET1 capital are assigned a 250% risk weight and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions not deducted from CET1 capital are assigned an exposure category risk weight.
In reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FRB and the other federal banking regulators adopted a final rule relative to regulatory capital treatment of ACL under CECL. This rule allowed electing banking organizations to delay the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital for a two-year period ending January 1, 2022, followed by a three-year transition period ending January 1, 2025 to phase-in the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay. As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay was $384 million.
(1) Required “Minimum Capital ratio” for 2021 and 2020 are: Common equity tier 1 capital of 4.5%; Tier 1 capital of 6.0%; Total capital of 8.0%; and Tier 1 leverage of 4.0%.
(2) “Minimum Capital ratios” include a stress capital buffer of 3.4%; N/A to Tier 1 leverage.
At December 31, 2021, our CET1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were 9.9%, 11.1% and 12.7%, respectively, as compared with 10.0%, 11.3% and 13.4%, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. The CET1 capital ratio decreased as $12.1 billion of risk-weighted asset (“RWA”) growth, and the impact of dividends and common share repurchases as described in “-Capital Transactions” below, a decrease in the modified CECL transitional amount and increases in goodwill and intangibles as a result of acquisitions were mostly offset by net income for the year ended December 31, 2021. The tier 1 capital ratio decreased due to the changes in CET1 capital described above and the redemption of Series A Preferred Stock offset by the issuance of Series G Preferred Stock described in “-Capital Transactions” below. The total capital ratio decreased due to the changes in CET1 and tier 1 capital described above combined with the net change in AACL and a decrease in qualifying subordinated debt resulting from haircut provisions partially offset by the subordinated debt exchange offer in the first quarter of 2021, as described in “-Capital Transactions” below. At December 31, 2021, our CET1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were approximately 200 basis points, 170 basis points and 130 basis points, respectively, above their regulatory minimums plus our SCB. All ratios remained well above the U.S. Basel III minimums.
Regulatory Capital Ratios and Capital Composition
CET1 capital under U.S. Basel III Standardized rules totaled $15.7 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase from $14.6 billion at December 31, 2020, driven by net income for the year ended December 31, 2021
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 59
offset by dividends, common share repurchases, a decrease in the modified CECL transitional amount and increases in goodwill and intangibles as a result of acquisitions. Tier 1 capital at December 31, 2021 totaled $17.7 billion, reflecting a $1.1 billion increase from $16.6 billion at December 31, 2020, driven by the changes in CET1 capital and the issuance of Series G Preferred Stock, partially offset by the redemption of Series A Preferred Stock. Total capital of $20.2 billion at December 31, 2021 increased $642 million from December 31, 2020, driven by the changes in CET1 and tier 1 capital, partially offset by the net change in AACL and a decrease in qualifying subordinated debt.
RWA totaled $158.8 billion at December 31, 2021, based on U.S. Basel III Standardized rules, up $12.1 billion from December 31, 2020. This increase was driven by higher commercial loans, automobile loans, commercial commitments, bank-owned life insurance, residential mortgages, agency securities, MSRs, education loans and other retail commitments. These RWA increases were partially offset by lower derivative valuations and other retail loans.
As of December 31, 2021, the tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.7%, up from 9.4% at December 31, 2020 driven by higher tier one capital, partially offset by the $6.4 billion increase in quarterly adjusted average assets.
(1) As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the amount of non-qualifying subordinated debt excluded from regulatory capital was $420 million and $348 million, respectively.
(2) Excess allowance represents the amount excluded from tier 2 capital that is in excess of 1.25% of risk weighted assets, excluding market risk.
On February 11, 2021, we completed $265 million in private exchange offers for five series of outstanding subordinated notes. Exchange offer participants received newly-issued fixed-rate reset subordinated notes due 2031 which are redeemable by us five years prior to their maturity. These subordinated debt exchange offers will benefit our tier 2 and total capital going forward by increasing the amount of subordinated debt eligible for inclusion in tier 2 capital without increasing the aggregate principal amount of subordinated debt outstanding. See Note 13 for more details on our outstanding subordinated debt.
Capital Adequacy Process
Our assessment of capital adequacy begins with our board-approved risk appetite and risk management framework. This framework provides for the identification, measurement and management of material risks. Capital requirements are determined for actual and forecasted risk portfolios using applicable regulatory capital methodologies. The assessment also considers the possible impacts of approved and proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements. Key analytical frameworks, including stress testing, which enable the assessment of capital adequacy versus unexpected loss under a variety of stress scenarios, supplement our base
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 60
line forecast. A governance framework supports our capital planning process, including capital management policies and procedures that document capital adequacy metrics and limits, as well as our Capital Contingency Plan and the active engagement of both the legal-entity boards and senior management in oversight and decision-making.
Forward-looking assessments of capital adequacy feed development of a single capital plan covering us and our banking subsidiary that is periodically submitted to the FRB. We prepare this plan in full compliance with the FRB’s Capital Plan Rule and we participate annually in the FRB’s horizontal capital review, which is the FRB’s assessment of specific capital planning areas as part of their normal supervisory process.
Capital Transactions
We completed the following capital actions during 2021:
•Repurchased $95 million of our outstanding common stock in the first quarter and $200 million of our outstanding common stock in the fourth quarter;
•Redeemed all outstanding shares of 5.500% fixed-to-floating rate non-cumulative perpetual Series A Preferred Stock in the third quarter;
•Issued 300,000 shares of 4.000% fixed-rate reset non-cumulative perpetual Series G Preferred Stock at an aggregate offering price of $300 million in the second quarter;

•Declared quarterly dividends of $14.13 per share on the 5.650% fixed-rate non-cumulative perpetual Series F Preferred Stock, aggregating to $23 million; and
•Declared quarterly dividends of $12.78 per share in the third quarter of 2021 and $10.00 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021 on the 4.000% fixed-rate reset non-cumulative perpetual Series G Preferred Stock, aggregating to $7 million.
Banking Subsidiary’s Capital
CBNA’s CET1 and tier 1 capital totaled $17.0 billion at December 31, 2021, up $1.0 billion from $16.0 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by net income for the year ended December 31,
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 61
2021, partially offset by dividend payments to the Parent Company and a decrease in the modified CECL transitional amount. Total capital was $19.6 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $620 million from $19.0 billion at December 31, 2020, driven by the change in CET1 capital, partially offset by the net change in AACL.
CBNA’s RWA totaled $158.6 billion at December 31, 2021, up $12.0 billion from December 31, 2020. This increase was driven by higher commercial loans, automobile loans, commercial commitments, bank-owned life insurance, residential mortgages, agency securities, MSRs, education loans and other retail commitments. These RWA increases were partially offset by lower derivative valuations and other retail loans.
As of December 31, 2021, the CBNA tier 1 leverage ratio increased to 9.4% from 9.2% at December 31, 2020, driven by higher tier one capital, partially offset by the $6.3 billion increase in quarterly adjusted average assets.
LIQUIDITY
Liquidity is defined as our ability to meet our cash-flow and collateral obligations in a timely manner, at a reasonable cost. An institution must maintain operating liquidity to meet its expected daily and forecasted cash-flow requirements, as well as contingent liquidity to meet unexpected (stress scenario) funding requirements. Reflecting the importance of meeting all unexpected and stress-scenario funding requirements, we identify and manage contingent liquidity, consisting of cash balances at the FRB, unencumbered high-quality liquid securities and unused FHLB borrowing capacity. Separately, we also identify and manage asset liquidity as a subset of contingent liquidity, consisting of cash balances at the FRB and unencumbered high-quality liquid securities. We consider the effective and prudent management of liquidity fundamental to our health and strength. We manage liquidity at the consolidated enterprise level and at each material legal entity, including at the Parent Company and CBNA level.
Parent Company Liquidity
Our Parent Company’s primary sources of cash are dividends and interest received from CBNA as a result of investing in bank equity and subordinated debt as well as externally issued preferred stock, senior and subordinated debt. Uses of cash include the routine cash flow requirements as a bank holding company, including periodic share repurchases and payments of dividends, interest and expenses; the needs of subsidiaries, including CBNA for additional equity and, as required, its need for debt financing; and the support for extraordinary funding requirements when necessary. To the extent the Parent Company has relied on wholesale borrowings, uses also include payments of related principal and interest.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Parent Company completed the following transactions:
•Redeemed all outstanding shares of 5.50% fixed-to-floating rate non-cumulative perpetual Series A Preferred Stock;
•Issued 300,000 shares of 4.00% fixed-rate reset non-cumulative perpetual Series G Preferred Stock at an aggregate offering price of $300 million; and
•Redeemed $350 million of 2.375% fixed-rate senior unsecured debt due July 2021.
For further information on outstanding debt and preferred stock, see Note 13 and Note 17 in Item 8.
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Parent Company declared dividends on common stock of $670 million and $672 million, respectively, and declared dividends on preferred stock of $113 million and $107 million, respectively. In addition, the Parent Company repurchased $295 million and $270 million of its outstanding common stock, respectively.
Our Parent Company’s cash and cash equivalents represent a source of liquidity that can be used to meet various needs and totaled $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2021 compared with $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2020. The Parent Company’s double-leverage ratio (the combined equity investment in Parent Company subsidiaries divided by Parent Company equity) is a measure of reliance on equity cash flows from subsidiaries to fund Parent Company obligations. At December 31, 2021, the Parent Company’s double-leverage ratio was 98.5%.
CBNA Liquidity
As CBNA’s primary business involves taking deposits and making loans, a key role of liquidity management is to ensure that customers have timely access to funds from deposits and for loans. Liquidity management also involves maintaining sufficient liquidity to repay wholesale borrowings, pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding requirements when necessary. In the ordinary course of business, the liquidity of CBNA is
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 62
managed by matching sources and uses of cash. The primary sources of bank liquidity include deposits from our consumer and commercial customers; payments of principal and interest on loans and debt securities; and wholesale borrowings, as needed, and as described under “-Liquidity Risk Management and Governance.” The primary uses of bank liquidity include withdrawals and maturities of deposits; payment of interest on deposits; funding of loans and related commitments; and funding of securities purchases. To the extent that CBNA has relied on wholesale borrowings, uses also include payments of related principal and interest. For further information on CBNA’s outstanding debt, see Note 13 in Item 8.
On January 14, 2022, CBNA redeemed $1.0 billion of senior notes due February 2022.
Liquidity Risk
We define liquidity risk as the risk that an entity will be unable to meet its payment obligations in a timely manner, at a reasonable cost. Liquidity risk can arise due to contingent liquidity risk and/or funding liquidity risk.
Contingent liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions may reduce an entity’s ability to liquidate, pledge and/or finance certain assets and thereby substantially reduce the liquidity value of such assets. Drivers of contingent liquidity risk include general market disruptions as well as specific issues regarding the credit quality and/or valuation of a security or loan, issuer or borrower and/or asset class.
Funding liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions and/or entity-specific events may reduce an entity’s ability to raise funds from depositors and/or wholesale market counterparties. Drivers of funding liquidity risk may be idiosyncratic or systemic, reflecting impediments to operations and/or damaged market confidence.
Factors Affecting Liquidity
Given the composition of assets and borrowing sources, contingent liquidity risk at CBNA would be materially affected by events such as deterioration of financing markets for high-quality securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities and other instruments issued by the GNMA, FNMA and the FHLMC), by any inability of the FHLBs to provide collateralized advances and/or by a refusal of the FRB to act as a lender of last resort in systemic stress.
Similarly, given the structure of its balance sheet, the funding liquidity risk of CBNA would be materially affected by an adverse idiosyncratic event (e.g., a major loss, causing a perceived or actual deterioration in its financial condition), an adverse systemic event (e.g., default or bankruptcy of a significant capital markets participant), or a combination of both. Consequently, and despite ongoing exposure to a variety of idiosyncratic and systemic events, we view our contingent liquidity risk and our funding liquidity risk to be relatively modest.
An additional variable affecting our access to unsecured wholesale market funds and to large denomination (i.e., uninsured) customer deposits is the credit ratings assigned by such agencies as Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s, and Fitch.
NR = Not Rated
Changes in our public credit ratings could affect both the cost and availability of our wholesale funding. As a result, and in order to maintain a conservative funding profile, CBNA continues to minimize reliance on
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 63
unsecured wholesale funding. At December 31, 2021, our wholesale funding consisted primarily of term debt issued by the Parent Company and CBNA.
Existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements represent another key driver of systemic liquidity conditions and liquidity management practices. The FRB, the OCC, and the FDIC regularly evaluate our liquidity as part of the overall supervisory process. In addition, we are subject to existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements, some of which are subject to further rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators. For further discussion, see the “Regulation and Supervision - Tailoring of Prudential Requirements” and “-Liquidity Requirements” sections in Item 1.
Liquidity Risk Management and Governance
Liquidity risk is measured and managed by the Funding and Liquidity unit within our Treasury unit in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our Board and the Asset Liability Committee. In managing liquidity risk, the Funding and Liquidity unit delivers regular and comprehensive reporting, including current levels versus threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics and early warning indicators, explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and, as appropriate, recommended remedial strategies.
Our Funding and Liquidity unit’s primary goals are to deliver and maintain prudent levels of operating liquidity to support expected and projected funding requirements, contingent liquidity to support unexpected funding requirements resulting from idiosyncratic, systemic and combination stress events, and regulatory liquidity requirements in a timely manner from stable and cost-efficient funding sources. We seek to accomplish this goal by funding loans with stable deposits; by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding, particularly short-term unsecured funding; and by maintaining ample available liquidity, including a contingent liquidity buffer of unencumbered high-quality loans and securities. As of December 31, 2021:
•Organically generated deposits continue to be our primary source of funding, resulting in a consolidated year-end loans-to-deposits ratio, excluding LHFS, of 83.0%;
•Our cash position, which is defined as our cash balances at the FRB, totaled $7.9 billion;
•Our total available liquidity, comprised of contingent liquidity and available discount window capacity, was approximately $70.9 billion;
•Contingent liquidity was $45.1 billion, consisting of unencumbered high-quality liquid securities of $21.3 billion, unused FHLB capacity of $15.9 billion, and our cash balances at the FRB of $7.9 billion. Asset liquidity, a component of contingent liquidity, was $29.2 billion, consisting of our cash balances at the FRB of $7.9 billion and unencumbered high-quality liquid securities of $21.3 billion;
•Available discount window capacity, defined as available total borrowing capacity from the FRB based on identified collateral, is secured by non-mortgage commercial and retail loans and totaled $25.8 billion. Use of this borrowing capacity would be considered only during exigent circumstances; and
•For a summary of our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 8.
The Funding and Liquidity unit monitors a variety of liquidity and funding metrics and early warning indicators and metrics, including specific risk thresholds limits. These monitoring tools are broadly classified as follows:
•Current liquidity sources and capacities, including cash balances at the FRB, free and liquid securities, and secured FHLB borrowing capacity;
•Liquidity stress sources, including idiosyncratic, systemic and combined stresses, in addition to evolving regulatory requirements; and
•Current and prospective exposures, including secured and unsecured wholesale funding, and spot and cumulative cash-flow gaps across a variety of horizons.
Further, certain of these metrics are monitored individually for CBNA and for our consolidated enterprise on a daily basis, including cash position, unencumbered securities, asset liquidity, and available FHLB borrowing capacity. In order to identify emerging trends and risks and inform funding decisions, specific metrics are also forecasted over a one-year horizon.
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 64
Contractual Obligations
In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual obligations that may require future cash payments, including customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, lease obligations and other cash commitments. For more information regarding these obligations, see Notes 9, 12 and 13 in Item 8.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We engage in a variety of activities that are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that are generally referred to as “off-balance sheet arrangements.” For more information on these types of activities, see Note 19 in Item 8.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Our audited Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Report, are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our audited Consolidated Financial Statements.
An accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are made using facts and circumstances known at a point in time. Changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates. Our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below. See Note 1 in Item 8, for further discussion of our significant accounting policies.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The ACL decreased from $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020 to $1.9 billion at December 31, 2021, reflecting a reserve release of $736 million reflecting improvements in our macroeconomic outlook and continued strength in the Home Price Index and used automobile values.
To determine the ACL as of December 31, 2021, we utilized an economic forecast that generally reflects real GDP growth of approximately 1.3% over 2022 and projects the unemployment rate to be in the range of 5.2% to 6.6% throughout 2022. This forecast reflects an overall improved macroeconomic outlook as compared to December 31, 2020, which reflected real GDP growth of approximately 4% over 2021 and unemployment in the range of approximately 7% to 7.5% throughout 2021. While the U.S. economy has continued to improve, with the benefits of vaccination and herd resiliency muting, in part, the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, uncertainty remains. We continue to utilize our qualitative allowance framework to reassess and adjust ACL reserve levels. Macroeconomic forecast risk, driven by uncertainty around and volatility of key macroeconomic variables, is one of the primary factors influencing our qualitative reserve. As the economic recovery has continued, we have assessed risks to the recovery, including potential for continuing impacts from COVID-19 variants, challenges in the global supply chain, inflationary trends, potential impacts from ending monetary and fiscal stimulus programs, and potential for longer-term changes in workforce and consumer behaviors. We continued to apply management judgment to adjust the modeled reserves in the commercial industry sectors most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including CRE office.
Our determination of the ACL is sensitive to changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions during the reasonable and supportable period. To illustrate the sensitivity, we applied a more pessimistic scenario than that described above which assumes that challenges in acceptance of vaccines and efficacy of vaccines against new strains cause COVID-19-related infections to abate later than in our base case scenario, with concerns rising about resistant strains. Consumer spending is slower to rebound, with businesses reopening more slowly and vacation spending muted. This pessimistic scenario reflects real GDP growth of approximately 1.3% and unemployment in the range of 6.6% to 7.4% over 2022. Excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments, this scenario would result in a quantitative lifetime loss estimate of approximately 1.15x our modeled period-end ACL, or an increase of approximately $170 million. This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimate and not to the overall period-end ACL, which includes qualitative adjustments.
Because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the ACL, this sensitivity analysis does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the ACL or even what the ACL would be under these economic circumstances. The sensitivity is intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment and the corresponding impact to modeled loss estimates. The hypothetical determination does not incorporate the impact of management judgment or other
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 65
qualitative factors that could be applied in the actual estimation of the ACL and does not imply any expectation of future deterioration in our loss rates.
To provide additional context regarding sensitivity to more pessimistic scenarios, our ACL balance of $1.9 billion represents 22% of the $8.6 billion of nine-quarter losses projected in the Federal Reserve run of the December 2020 Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario, which forecasted more protracted unemployment and GDP declines compared with our ACL calculation. Our ACL calculation also included the impacts of government stimulus.
Comparatively, our ACL represents 38% of the $5.1 billion of projected losses in the Company run results of the Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario. Losses projected under the Company Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario are lower than the Federal Reserve results due to methodology and modeling differences. As an example, the Federal Reserve’s models did not recognize contractual loss sharing arrangements in the merchant loan portfolio. Both the Company and Federal Reserve results include incremental losses associated with loan originations assumed post-December 31, 2020. In contrast, our December 31, 2021 ACL balance considers only existing loans and lines of credit as of the reporting date.
While the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic continues, significant future uncertainty still exists, including the impacts of COVID-19 variants and challenges from vaccine acceptance rates and efficacy against newer strains on consumer sentiment and spending behavior. It remains difficult to estimate how changes in economic forecasts might affect our ACL because such forecasts consider a wide variety of variables and inputs, and changes in the variables and inputs may not occur at the same time or in the same direction, and such changes may have differing impacts by product types. The variables and inputs may be idiosyncratically affected by risks to the recovery, including potential for continuing impacts from COVID-19 variants, challenges in the global supply chain and recent inflationary trends, as well as potential impacts from ending monetary and fiscal stimulus programs. Changes in one or multiple of the key variables may have a material impact to our estimation of expected credit losses.
We continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 and related fiscal and monetary policy measures on the economy and the resulting potentially material effects on the ACL.
For additional information regarding the ACL, see Note 1 and Note 6 in Item 8.
Fair Value
We measure the fair value of assets and liabilities using the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is also used on a recurring and nonrecurring basis to evaluate certain assets for impairment or for financial statement disclosure purposes. Examples of nonrecurring uses of fair value include impairment for certain loans, leases and goodwill. Examples of recurring uses of fair value for financial statement disclosure purposes include disclosure of the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities accounted for on an amortized cost basis, such as HTM securities. For certain assets or liabilities the application of management judgment in the determination of the fair value is more significant due to the lack of observable market data.
MSRs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices. MSRs are classified as Level 3 since the valuation methodology utilizes significant unobservable inputs. The fair value is calculated using a discounted cash flow model which uses assumptions, including weighted-average life, prepayment assumptions and weighted-average option adjusted spread. It is important to note that changes in our assumptions may not be independent of each other; changes in one assumption may result in changes to another (e.g., changes in interest rates, which are inversely correlated to changes in prepayment rates, may result in changes to discount rates). The underlying assumptions and estimated values are corroborated by values received from independent third parties based on their review of the servicing portfolio, and comparisons to market transactions.
For additional information regarding our fair value measurements, see Note 1, Note 4, Note 9, Note 14 and Note 20 in Item 8.

RISK GOVERNANCE
We are committed to maintaining a strong, integrated and proactive approach to the management of all risks to which we are exposed in pursuit of our business objectives. A key aspect of our Board’s responsibility as the main decision making body is setting our risk appetite to ensure that the levels of risk that we are willing to accept in the attainment of our strategic business and financial objectives are clearly understood.
To enable our Board to carry out its objectives, it has delegated authority for risk management activities, as well as governance and oversight of those activities, to a number of Board and executive management level risk committees. The Executive Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for oversight of risk across the enterprise and actively considers our inherent material risks, analyzes our overall risk profile and seeks confirmation that the risks are being appropriately identified, assessed and mitigated. Reporting to the Executive Risk Committee are the following committees covering specific areas of risk: Compliance and Operational Risk Committee, Model Risk Committee, Credit Policy Committee, Asset Liability Committee, Business Initiatives Review Committee, and the Conduct and Ethics Committee.
Risk Framework
Our risk management framework is embedded in our business through a “Three Lines of Defense” model which defines responsibilities and accountabilities for risk management activities.
First Line of Defense
The business lines (including their associated support functions) are the first line of defense and are accountable for identifying, assessing, managing, and controlling the risks associated with the products and services they provide. The business lines are responsible for performing regular risk assessments to identify and assess the material risks that arise in their area of responsibility, complying with relevant risk policies, testing and certifying the adequacy and effectiveness of their operational and financial reporting controls on a regular basis, establishing and documenting operating procedures and establishing and owning a governance structure for identifying and managing risk.
Second Line of Defense
The second line of defense includes independent monitoring and control functions accountable for developing and ensuring implementation of risk and control frameworks and related policies. This centralized risk function is appropriately independent from the business and is accountable for overseeing and challenging our business lines on the effective management of their risks, including credit, market, operational, regulatory, reputational, interest rate, liquidity and strategic risks.
Third Line of Defense
Our Internal Audit function is the third line of defense providing independent assurance with a view of the effectiveness of our internal controls, governance practices, and culture so that risk is managed appropriately for the size, complexity, and risk profile of the organization. Internal Audit has complete and unrestricted access to any and all of our records, physical properties and personnel. Internal Audit issues a report following each internal review and provides an audit opinion to the Board’s Audit Committee on a quarterly basis.
Credit Review reports to the Chief Audit Executive and provides the legal-entity boards, senior management and other stakeholders with independent assurance on the quality of credit portfolios and adherence to agreed Credit Risk Appetite and Credit Policies and processes. In line with its procedures and regulatory expectations, the Credit Review function undertakes a program of portfolio testing, assessing and reporting through four Risk Pillars of Asset Quality, Rating and Data Integrity, Risk Management and Credit Risk Appetite.
Risk Appetite
Risk appetite is a strategic business and risk management tool. We define our risk appetite as the maximum limit of acceptable risk beyond which we could be unable to achieve our strategic objectives and capital adequacy obligations.
Our principal non-market risks include credit, operational, regulatory, reputational, liquidity and strategic risks. We are also subject to certain market risks which include potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and/or other relevant market rates or prices. Market risk in our business arises from trading activities that serve customer needs, including hedging of
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 67
interest rates, foreign exchange risk and non-trading activities within capital markets. We have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report on market risk. We actively manage both trading and non-trading market risks. See “-Market Risk” for further information. Our risk appetite is reviewed and approved annually by the Board Risk Committee.
Credit Risk
Overview
Credit risk represents the potential for loss arising from a customer, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform in accordance with the contractual terms of the obligation. While the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities, we do engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing, asset and liability management, and trading activities. Given the financial impact of credit risk on our earnings and balance sheet, the assessment, approval and management of credit risk represents a major part of our overall risk-management responsibility.
Objective
The independent Credit Risk Function is responsible for reviewing and approving credit risk appetite across all lines of business and credit products, approving larger and higher risk credit transactions, monitoring portfolio performance, identifying problem credit exposures, and ensuring remedial management.
Organizational Structure
Management and oversight of credit risk is the responsibility of both the business line and the second line of defense. The second line of defense, the independent Credit Risk Function, is led by the Chief Credit Officer who oversees all of our credit risk. The Chief Credit Officer reports to the Chief Risk Officer. The Chief Credit Officer, acting in a manner consistent with Board policies, has responsibility for, among other things, the governance process around policies, procedures, risk acceptance criteria, credit risk appetite, limits and authority delegation. The Chief Credit Officer and team also have responsibility for credit approvals for larger and higher risk transactions and oversight of line of business credit risk activities. Reporting to the Chief Credit Officer are the heads of the second line of defense credit functions specializing in: Consumer Banking, Commercial Banking, Citizens Restructuring Management, Portfolio and Corporate Reporting, ALLL Analytics, Current Expected Credit Loss, and Credit Policy and Administration. Each team under these leaders is composed of highly experienced credit professionals.
Governance
The primary mechanisms used to govern our credit risk function are our consumer and commercial credit policies. These policies outline the minimum acceptable lending standards that align with our desired risk appetite. Material changes in our business model and strategies that identify a need to change our risk appetite or highlight a risk not previously contemplated are identified by the individual committees and presented to the Credit Policy Committee, Executive Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee for approval, as appropriate.
Key Management Processes
We employ a comprehensive and integrated risk control program to proactively identify, measure, monitor, and mitigate existing and emerging credit risks across the credit life cycle (origination, account management/portfolio management, and loss mitigation and recovery).
Consumer
On the Consumer Banking side of credit risk, our teams use models to evaluate consumer loans across the life cycle of the loan. Starting at origination, credit scoring models are used to forecast the probability of default of an applicant. When approving customers for a new loan or extension of an existing credit line, credit scores are used in conjunction with other credit risk variables such as affordability, length of term, collateral value, collateral type, and lien subordination.
To ensure proper oversight of the underwriting teams, lending authority is granted by the second line of defense credit risk function to each underwriter. The amount of delegated authority depends on the experience of the individual. We periodically evaluate the performance of each underwriter and annually reauthorize their delegated authority. Only senior members of the second line of defense credit risk team are authorized to approve significant exceptions to credit policies. It is not uncommon to make exceptions to established policies
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 68
when compensating factors are present. There are exception limits which, when reached, trigger a comprehensive analysis.
Once an account is established, credit scores and collateral values are refreshed at regular intervals to allow for proactive identification of increasing or decreasing levels of credit risk. Our approach to managing credit risk is highly analytical and, where appropriate, is automated to ensure consistency and efficiency.
Commercial
On the Commercial Banking side of credit risk, risk management begins with defined credit products and policies and is separated into C&I loans, leases and CRE. Within C&I loans and leases there are separate verticals established for certain specialty products (e.g., asset-based lending, leasing, franchise finance, health care, technology and mid-corporate). A “specialty vertical” is a stand-alone team of industry or product specialists. Substantially all activity that falls under the ambit of the defined industry or product is managed through a specialty vertical when one exists. CRE also operates as a specialty vertical.
Commercial transactions are subject to individual analysis and approval at origination and, with few exceptions, are subject to a formal annual review requirement. The underwriting process includes the establishment and approval of credit grades that confirm the PD and LGD. All material transactions then require the approval of both a business line approver and an independent credit approver with the requisite level of delegated authority. The approval level of a particular credit facility is determined by the size of the credit relationship as well as the PD. The checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit approver function are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted, facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur, and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution. All authority to grant credit is delegated through the independent Credit Risk function and is closely monitored and regularly updated.
The primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower, assessment of the borrower’s management capabilities, cash flows from operations, industry sector trends, type and sufficiency of collateral, type of exposure, transaction structure, and the general economic outlook. While these are the primary factors considered, there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process. In addition to the credit analysis conducted during the approval process at origination and annual review, our Credit Review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the portfolio and new originations. This group conducts portfolio reviews on a risk-based cycle to evaluate individual loans and validate risk ratings, as well as test the consistency of the credit processes and the effectiveness of credit risk management.
The maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers. Concentration risk is managed through limits on industry asset class and loan quality factors. We focus predominantly on extending credit to commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary markets, although we do engage in lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe that the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives.
Substantially all loans categorized as Classified are managed by a specialized group of credit professionals.
MARKET RISK
Market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and/or other relevant market rates or prices. Modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs, including hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk. As described below, more material market risk arises from our non-trading banking activities, such as loan origination and deposit-gathering. We have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market risk. We actively manage market risk for both non-trading and trading activities.
Non-Trading Risk
We are exposed to market risk as a result of non-trading banking activities. This market risk is substantially composed of interest rate risk, as we have no commodity risk and de minimis direct currency and equity risk. We also have market risk related to capital markets loan originations, as well as the valuation of our MSRs.
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 69
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk emerges from the balance sheet after the aggregation of our assets, liabilities and equity. We refer to this non-trading risk embedded in the balance sheet as “structural interest rate risk” or “interest rate risk in the banking book.”
A major source of structural interest rate risk is a difference in the repricing of assets relative to liabilities and equity. There are differences in the timing and drivers of rate changes reflecting the maturity and/or repricing of assets and liabilities. For example, the rate earned on a commercial loan may reprice monthly with changes in LIBOR, while the rate paid on debt or certificates of deposit may be fixed for a longer period. There may also be differences in the drivers of rate changes. Loans may be tied to a specific index rate such as LIBOR or Prime, while deposits may be only loosely correlated with LIBOR and dependent upon competitive demand. Due to these basis differences, net interest income is sensitive to changes in spreads between certain indices or repricing rates.
Another important source of structural interest rate risk relates to the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options. For example, most consumer loans can be prepaid without penalty and most consumer deposits can also be withdrawn without penalty. The exercise of such options by customers can exacerbate the timing differences discussed above.
A primary source of our structural interest rate risk relates to faster repricing of floating-rate loans relative to core deposit funding. This source of asset sensitivity is more biased toward the short end of the yield curve.
The secondary source of our interest rate risk is driven by longer term rates comprising the rollover or reinvestment risk on fixed-rate loans, as well as prepayment risk on mortgage-related loans and securities funded by non-rate sensitive deposits and equity.
The primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by our Board. These limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short-term and long-term horizons. To ensure that exposure to interest rate risk is managed within our risk appetite, we must measure the exposure and hedge it, as necessary. The Treasury Asset and Liability Management team is responsible for measuring, monitoring and reporting on our structural interest rate risk position. These exposures are reported on a monthly basis to the Asset Liability Committee and at Board meetings.
We measure structural interest rate risk through a variety of metrics intended to quantify both short-term and long-term exposures. The primary method we use to quantify interest rate risk is simulation analysis in which we model net interest income from assets, liabilities and hedge derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios over a three-year horizon. Exposure to interest rate risk is reflected in the variation of forecasted net interest income across the scenarios.
Key assumptions in this simulation analysis relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads, the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments. The most material of these behavioral assumptions relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate (i.e., non-contractual) maturities, as well as the pace of mortgage prepayments. Assessments are periodically made by running sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of key assumptions. The results of these analyses are reported to the Asset Liability Committee.
As the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance, we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including a “most likely” (implied forward) scenario, as well as a variety of deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios. These scenarios may assume gradual ramping of the overall level of interest rates, immediate shocks to the level of rates and various yield curve twists in which movements in short- or long-term rates predominate. Generally, projected net interest income in any interest rate scenario is compared to net interest income in a base case where market forward rates are realized.
The table below reports net interest income exposures against a variety of interest rate scenarios. Our policies involve measuring exposures as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous or gradual parallel changes in rates relative to the market implied forward yield curve. As the following table illustrates, our balance sheet is asset-sensitive; net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates, while exposure to a decline in interest rates is within limit. While an instantaneous and
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 70
severe shift in interest rates is included in this analysis, we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and therefore have a more modest impact.
The table below presents the sensitivity of net interest income to various parallel yield curve shifts from the market implied forward yield curve:
We continue to manage asset sensitivity within the scope of our policy and changing market conditions. Asset sensitivity against a 200 basis point gradual increase in rates was 10.1% at December 31, 2021, compared with 10.8% at December 31, 2020. Current levels of asset sensitivity continue to provide meaningful upside benefit to net interest income as we enter a period of expected higher short-term policy rates from the Federal Reserve. Changes in interest rates can also affect the risk positions, which impacts the repricing sensitivity or beta of the deposit base as well as the cash flows on assets that allow for early payoff without a penalty. The risk position is managed within our risk limits, and long term view of interest rates through occasional adjustments to securities investments, interest rate swaps and mix of funding.
We use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk, Economic Value of Equity (“EVE”), as a supplement to net interest income simulations. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure over a long-term horizon. EVE measures the extent to which the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. The change in value is expressed as a percentage of regulatory capital.
We use interest rate swap contracts to manage the interest rate exposure to variability in the interest cash flows on our floating-rate assets and floating-rate wholesale funding, and to hedge market risk on fixed-rate capital markets debt issuances.
(1) Asset Liability Management (“ALM”) strategies used to manage interest rate exposures include interest rate swap contracts used to manage exposure to the variability in the interest cash flows on our floating-rate commercial loans and floating-rate wholesale funding, as well as the variability in the fair value of AFS securities.
(2) December 31, 2020 includes $1.8 billion of forward-starting, pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were terminated in the first quarter of 2021.

The following table presents the pre-tax net gains (losses) recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income relating to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges:
(1) Using the interest rate curve at December 31, 2021 with respect to cash flow hedge strategies, we estimate that approximately $36 million will be reclassified from AOCI to net interest income over the next 12 months.
LIBOR Transition
As previously disclosed, many of our lending products, securities, derivatives, and other financial transactions utilize the LIBOR benchmark rate, requiring us to develop plans for its discontinuance. In late 2018, we formed a LIBOR Transition Program (“the Program”) designed to guide the organization through the planned discontinuation of LIBOR. The Program, with direction and oversight from our Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for developing, maintaining and executing against a coordinated strategy to ensure a timely and orderly transition from LIBOR. The Program is structured to address various initiatives including program governance, transition management, communications, exposure management, new alternative reference rate product delivery, risk management, contract remediation, operations and technology readiness, accounting and reporting, as well as tax and regulation impacts. On a quarterly basis we tracked and reviewed the risks associated with the LIBOR transition with a focus on the identification of mitigation actions.
The ARRC recommended that banks be systemically and operationally capable of supporting transactions in alternative reference rates, such as SOFR, by the end of September 2020. Guided by this milestone, we are systemically and operationally prepared to support alternative reference rate transactions. On March 5, 2021, the FCA formally announced the future cessation or loss of representation of the LIBOR benchmark settings currently published by the Intercontinental Exchange (“ICE”) Benchmark Administration. Further, the FCA stated that the 1-week and 2-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR rates will cease as of December 31, 2021 and all other U.S. Dollar LIBOR tenors will cease as of June 30, 2023. With the FRB, OCC, and FDIC (collectively, the agencies) supporting this announcement, the Program adjusted LIBOR transition activities and timelines accordingly. The agencies continue to urge market participants to stop entering into new U.S. Dollar LIBOR contracts as soon as practicable, but no later than the end of 2021. We moved new originations to alternative reference rates over the course of 2021 in anticipation of this deadline. However, our plans for legacy contract remediation now extend through mid-2023 given the FCA announcement. More broadly, program governance remains robust, and progress has been made in the above-outlined initiatives as management continues to closely monitor industry and regulatory developments pertaining to the transition.
Upon commencement of the Program, we conducted an impact assessment to identify all areas that were likely to be impacted by the LIBOR transition. The impact assessment identified where LIBOR-related products, systems, models, policies and procedures existed. We used the assessment results to develop a robust transition roadmap and an implementation plan, which continues to evolve, based on market and regulatory developments. Key LIBOR transition efforts over the course of 2021 include, but are not limited to, the following:
•Upgraded standard form provisions and issued implementation guidance to require use of reference rate fallback language in any new and existing LIBOR contracts in connection with contract amendments made in the ordinary course of business;
•Launched new product issuances with alternative reference rates;
•Completed operational readiness of systems, models, and applications to handle all potential alternative reference rates;
•Remediated legacy contracts that reference non-U.S. Dollar LIBOR in preparation for the December 31, 2021 cessation of LIBOR quotations for non-U.S. Dollar currencies;
•Analyzed existing fallback language in legacy contracts to assess robustness and devise a strategy for those requiring remediation;
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 72
•Continued to develop and enhance internet and intranet sites for the LIBOR transition; and
•Participated in industry and ARRC working groups to ascertain market developments and assess the impact to us and our customers.
Capital Markets
A key component of our capital markets activities is the underwriting and distribution of corporate credit facilities to partially finance merger and acquisition transactions for our clients. We have a rigorous risk management process around these activities, including a limit structure capping our underwriting risk, our potential loss, and sub-limits for specific asset classes. Further, the ability to approve underwriting exposure is delegated only to senior level individuals in the credit risk management and capital markets organizations with each transaction adjudicated in the Loan Underwriting Approval Committee.
Mortgage Servicing Rights
We have market risk associated with the value of residential MSRs, which are impacted by various types of inherent risks, including duration, basis, convexity, volatility and yield curve.
As part of our overall risk management strategy relative to the fair market value of the MSRs we enter into various free-standing derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, interest rate swaptions, interest rate futures, and forward contracts to purchase mortgage-backed securities to economically hedge the changes in fair value. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of our MSRs was $1.0 billion and $658 million, respectively, and the total notional amount of related derivative contracts was $11.8 billion and $11.4 billion, respectively. Gains and losses on MSRs and the related derivatives used for hedging are included in mortgage banking fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
As with our traded market risk-based activities, earnings at risk excludes the impact of MSRs. MSRs are captured under our single price risk management framework that is used for calculating a management value at risk that is consistent with the definition used by banking regulators.
Trading Risk
We are exposed to market risk primarily through client facilitation activities including derivatives and foreign exchange products, as well as underwriting and market making activities. Exposure is created as a result of changes in interest rates and related basis spreads and volatility, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads on a select range of interest rates, foreign exchange, commodities, equity securities, corporate bonds and secondary loan instruments.These securities underwriting and trading activities are conducted through CBNA, CCMI, and JMP.
Client facilitation activities consist primarily of interest rate derivatives, financially settled commodity derivatives and foreign exchange contracts where we enter into offsetting trades with a separate counterparty or exchange to manage our market risk exposure. In addition to the aforementioned activities, we operate trading desks covering secondary loans, corporate bonds, and equity securities; all with the objective to meet secondary liquidity needs of our issuing clients’ transactions and investor clients. We do not engage in any trading activities with the intent to benefit from short-term price differences.
We record these rate and commodity derivatives and foreign exchange contracts as derivative assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Trading assets and liabilities are carried at fair value with income earned related to these activities included in net interest income. Changes in fair value of trading assets and liabilities are reflected in other income, a component of noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Market Risk Governance
The market risk limit setting process is established in-line with the formal enterprise risk appetite process and policy. This appetite reflects the strategic and enterprise level articulation of opportunities for creating franchise value set to the boundaries of how much market risk to assume. Dealing authorities represent the key control tool in the management of market risk that allows the cascading of the risk appetite throughout the enterprise. A dealing authority sets the operational scope and tolerances within which a business and/or trading desk is permitted to operate, which is reviewed at least annually. Dealing authorities are structured to accommodate client facing trades and hedges needed to manage the risk profile. Primary responsibility for keeping within established tolerances resides with the business. Key risk indicators, including VaR, open foreign
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 73
currency positions and single name risk, are monitored on a daily basis and reported against tolerances consistent with our risk appetite and business strategy to relevant business line management and risk counterparts.
Market Risk Measurement
We use VaR as a statistical measure for estimating potential exposure of our traded market risk in normal market conditions. Our VaR framework for risk management and regulatory reporting is the same. Risk management VaR is based on a one day holding period to a 99% confidence level, whereas regulatory VaR is based on a ten-day holding period to the same confidence level. In addition to VaR, non-statistical measurements for measuring risk are employed, such as sensitivity analysis, market value and stress testing.
Our market risk platform and associated market risk and valuation models capture correlation effects across all our “covered positions” and allow for aggregation of market risk across products, risk types, business lines and legal entities. We measure, monitor and report market risk for both management and regulatory capital purposes.
VaR Overview
The market risk measurement model is based on historical simulation. The VaR measure estimates the extent of any fair value losses on trading positions that may occur due to broad market movements (General VaR) such as changes in the level of interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. It is calculated on the basis that current positions remain broadly unaltered over the course of a given holding period. It is assumed that markets are sufficiently liquid to allow the business to close its positions, if required, within this holding period. VaR’s benefit is that it captures the historic correlations of a portfolio. Based on the composition of our “covered positions,” we also use a standardized add-on approach for the loan trading and high yield bond desks’ Specific Risk capital which estimates the extent of any losses that may occur from factors other than broad market movements. The General VaR approach is expressed in terms of a confidence level over the past 500 trading days. The internal VaR measure (used as the basis of the main VaR trading limits) is a 99% confidence level with a one day holding period, meaning that a loss greater than the VaR is expected to occur, on average, on only one day in 100 trading days (i.e., 1% of the time). Theoretically, there should be a loss event greater than VaR two to three times per year. The regulatory measure of VaR is done at a 99% confidence level with a ten-day holding period. The historical market data applied to calculate the VaR is updated on a two-business day lag. Refer to “Market Risk Regulatory Capital” below for details of our ten-day VaR metrics for the quarters ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, including high, low, average and period end VaR for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks, as well as total VaR.
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 74
Market Risk Regulatory Capital
The U.S. banking regulators’ “Market Risk Rule” covers the calculation of market risk capital. For the purposes of the Market Risk Rule, all of our client facing trades and associated hedges maintain a net low risk and do qualify, as “covered positions.” The internal management VaR measure is calculated based on the same population of trades that is utilized for regulatory VaR.
Stressed VaR
SVaR is an extension of VaR as it uses a longer historical look-back horizon that is fixed from January 3, 2005. This is done not only to identify headline risks from more volatile periods, but also to provide a counterbalance to VaR which may be low during periods of low volatility. The holding period for profit and loss determination is ten days. In addition to risk management purposes, SVaR is also a component of market risk regulatory capital. We calculate SVaR daily under its own dynamic window regime. In a dynamic window regime, values of the ten-day, 99% VaR are calculated over all possible 260-day periods that can be obtained from the complete historical data set. Refer to “Market Risk Regulatory Capital” above for details of SVaR metrics, including high, low, average and period end SVaR for the combined portfolio.
Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor, such as a one basis point change in rates or credit spread. We conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates, basis spreads, foreign exchange exposures, option prices and credit spreads. Whereas VaR is based on previous moves in market risk factors over recent periods, it may not be an accurate predictor of future market moves. Sensitivity analysis complements VaR as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves and is an effective tool in evaluating the appropriateness of hedging strategies and concentrations.
Stress Testing
Conducting a stress test of a portfolio consists of running risk models with the inclusion of key variables that simulate various historical or hypothetical scenarios. For historical stress tests, profit and loss results are simulated for selected time periods corresponding to the most volatile underlying returns while hypothetical stress tests aim to consider concentration risk, illiquidity under stressed market conditions and risk arising from our trading activities that may not be fully captured by our other risk measurement methodologies. Hypothetical scenarios also assume that market moves happen simultaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as market events unfold. We generate stress tests of our trading positions on a daily basis. For example, we currently include a stress test that simulates a “Lehman-type” crisis scenario by taking the worst 20-trading day peak to trough moves for the various risk factors that go into VaR from that period, and assumes they occurred simultaneously.
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 75
VaR Model Review and Validation
Market risk measurement models used are independently reviewed and subject to ongoing performance analysis by the model owners. The independent review and validation focuses on the model methodology, market data, and performance. Independent review of market risk measurement models is the responsibility of Citizens’ Model Risk Management and Validation team. Aspects covered include challenging the assumptions used, the quantitative techniques employed and the theoretical justification underpinning them and an assessment of the soundness of the required data over time. Where possible, the quantitative impact of the major underlying modeling assumptions will be estimated (e.g., through developing alternative models). Results of such reviews are shared with our U.S. banking regulators. The market risk models may be periodically enhanced due to changes in market price levels and price action regime behavior. The Market Risk Management and Validation team will conduct internal validation before a new or changed model element is implemented and before a change is made to a market data mapping.
VaR Backtesting
Backtesting is one form of validation of the VaR model and is run daily. The Market Risk Rule requires a comparison of our internal VaR measure to the actual net trading revenue (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, intra-day trading and net interest income) for each day over the preceding year (the most recent 250 business days). Any observed loss in excess of the VaR number is taken as an exception. The level of exceptions determines the multiplication factor used to derive the VaR and SVaR-based capital requirement for regulatory reporting purposes, when applicable. We perform sub-portfolio backtesting as required under the Market Risk Rule, using models approved by our banking regulators, for interest rate, credit spread, and foreign exchange positions.
The following graph shows our daily net trading revenue and total internal, modeled VaR for the year ended December 31, 2021.
