Overview and Background
Emerald is a leading operator of business-to-business trade shows in the United States. Leveraging our shows as key market-driven platforms, we combine our events with effective industry insights, digital tools, and data-focused solutions to create uniquely rich experiences. Emerald strives to build its customers’ businesses by creating opportunities that deliver tangible results.
All of our trade show franchises typically hold market-leading positions within their respective industry verticals, with significant brand value established over a long period of time. Each of our shows are scheduled to stage at least annually, with certain franchises offering multiple editions per year. As our shows are frequently the largest and most well attended in their respective industry verticals, we are able to attract high-quality attendees, including those who have the authority to make purchasing decisions on the spot or subsequent to the show. The participation of these attendees makes our trade shows “must-attend” events for our exhibitors, further reinforcing the leading positions of our trade shows within their respective industry verticals. Our attendees use our shows to fulfill procurement needs, source new suppliers, reconnect with existing suppliers, identify trends, learn about new products and network with industry peers, which we believe are factors that make our shows difficult to replace with non-face-to-face events. Our portfolio of trade shows is well-balanced and diversified across both industry sectors and customers.
In addition to organizing our trade shows, conferences and other events, we also operate content and content-marketing websites and related digital products, and produce publications, each of which is aligned with a specific sector for which we organize an event. We also offer B2B commerce and digital merchandising solutions, serving the needs of manufacturers and retailers, through our recently acquired Elastic Suite and Flex platforms. In addition to their respective revenues, these products complement our live events and provide us year-round channels of customer acquisition and development.
Organic Growth Drivers
We are primarily focused on generating organic growth by understanding and leveraging the drivers for increased exhibitor and attendee participation at trade shows and providing year-round services that provide incremental value to those customers. Creating new opportunities for exhibitors to influence their market, engage with significant buyers, generate incremental sales and expand their brand’s awareness in their industry builds further demand for exhibit space and strengthens the value proposition of a trade show, generally allowing us to modestly increase booth space pricing annually across our portfolio. At the same time, our trade shows provide attendees with the opportunity to enhance their industry connectivity, develop relationships with targeted suppliers and distributors, discover new products, learn about new industry developments, celebrate their industry’s achievements and, in certain cases, obtain continuing professional education credits, which we believe increases their propensity to return and, consequently, drives high recurring participation among our exhibitors. By investing
in and promoting these tangible and return-on-investment linked outcomes, we believe we will be able to continue to enhance the value proposition for our exhibitors and attendees alike, thereby driving strong demand and premium pricing for exhibit space, sponsorship opportunities and attendee registration.
Acquisitions
We are also focused on growing our national footprint through the acquisition of high-quality events that are leaders in their specific industry verticals. Since the Onex Acquisition in June 2013, we have completed 22 strategic acquisitions, with purchase prices, excluding the $335.0 million acquisition of GLM, ranging from approximately $5.0 million to approximately $142.2 million, and annual revenues ranging from approximately $1.3 million to approximately $25.6 million. Historically, we have completed acquisitions at EBITDA purchase multiples that are typically in the mid-to-high single digits. Our acquisitions have historically been structured as asset deals that have resulted in the generation of long-lived tax assets, which in turn have reduced our purchase multiples when incorporating the value of the created tax assets. In the future, we intend to look for acquisitions with similarly attractive valuation multiples. The 22 acquisitions we have completed are described as follows:
•
GLM - Prior to its acquisition by Emerald in January 2014, GLM operated approximately 20 trade shows, including four of the largest 100 trade shows in the United States according to TSE. These trade shows serve industries as diverse as home furnishings, home textiles, stationery and paper products, giftware, tabletop, gourmet housewares, contemporary furniture and interiors, art & design, antiques & jewelry, fashion, board sports & resort lifestyle and eCommerce, and include the well-known NY NOW and Surf Expo brands. The acquisition of GLM substantially increased the scale and breadth of Emerald’s trade show portfolio.

Trends and Other Factors Affecting Our Business
There are a number of existing and developing factors and trends which impact the performance of our business, and the comparability of our results from year to year and from quarter to quarter, including:
•
Severe Impact of COVID-19 - In March 2020, the World Health Organization categorized COVID-19 as a pandemic, and the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency. In conjunction with this declaration and the spread of COVID-19 across the United States, recommendations and mandates were handed down by various local, state and federal government agencies regarding social distancing, containment areas and against large gatherings, as well as quarantine requirements. In addition, travel restrictions were imposed by the United States and foreign governments, and by companies with respect to their employees, and various event venues announced indefinite closures. As a result of these and various other factors, management made the decision to cancel or postpone a significant portion of our event calendar for the remainder of 2020 and the first half of 2021. The ongoing effects of COVID-19 on the Company’s operations and event calendar have had, and are expected to continue to have, a material negative impact on its financial results and liquidity. For more information, see “Risk Factors - The global COVID-19 pandemic has had a material detrimental impact on our business, financial results and liquidity, and such impact could worsen and last for an unknown period of time” and “-Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
•
Market Fragmentation - The trade show industry is highly fragmented with the three largest companies, including us, comprising only 10% of the wider U.S. market according to the AMR International Globex Report 2018. This has afforded us the opportunity to acquire other trade show businesses, a growth opportunity we expect to continue pursuing. These acquisitions may affect our growth trends, impacting the comparability of our financial results on a year-over-year basis.
•
Overall Economic Environment and Industry Sector Cyclicality - Our results of operations are correlated, in part, with the economic performance of the industry sectors that our trade shows serve, as well as the state of the overall economy, which may be affected by factors such as inflation and supply chain interruption.
•
Lag Time - As the majority of our exhibit space is sold during the twelve months prior to each trade show, there is often a timing difference between changes in the economic conditions of an industry sector vertical and their effect on our results of operations. This lag time can result in a counter-cyclical impact on our results of operations.
•
Variability in Quarterly Results - Our business is seasonal, with trade show revenues typically reaching their highest levels during the first quarter of each calendar year, and their lowest level during the fourth quarter, entirely due to the timing of our trade shows. This seasonality is typical within the trade show industry. However, as a result of event cancellations due to COVID-19, results for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, as well as future results, may not align with this historical trend. Since event revenue is recognized when a particular event is held, we may also experience fluctuations in quarterly revenue and cash flows based on the movement of annual trade
show dates from one quarter to another. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA accounts for these quarterly movements and the timing of shows, where applicable and material.
How We Assess the Performance of Our Business
In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key indicators of the financial condition and operating performance of our business are revenues, Organic revenue, cost of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, income taxes, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow.
Basis of Presentation
As described in Note 18, Segment Information, in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision-maker ("CODM"), evaluates performance based on the results of six executive brand portfolios, which represent our six operating segments. Based on an evaluation of economic similarities and the nature of services and types of customers, four of these operating segments have been aggregated into two reportable segments, the Commerce reportable segment and the Design and Technology reportable segment. The remaining two operating segments do not meet the quantitative thresholds to be considered reportable operating segments and are included in the “All Other” category. In addition, we have a Corporate-Level Activities category consisting of finance, legal, information technology and administrative functions.
The following discussion provides additional detailed disclosure for the two reportable segments, the All Other category and the Corporate-Level Activity category:
Commerce: This segment includes events and services covering merchandising, licensing, retail sourcing and marketing to enable professionals to make informed decisions and meet consumer demands.
Design and Technology: This segment includes events and services that support a wide variety of industries connecting businesses and professionals with products, operational strategies, and integration opportunities to drive new business and streamline processes and creative solutions.
All Other: This category consists of Emerald’s remaining operating segments, which provide diverse events and services but are not aggregated with the reportable segments.
Corporate-Level Activity: This category consists of Emerald’s finance, legal, information technology and administrative functions.
Revenues
We generate revenues primarily from selling trade show exhibit space to exhibitors on a per square foot basis. Other trade show revenue streams include sponsorship, fees for ancillary exhibition services and attendee registration fees. Additionally, we generate revenue through conferences, digital media and print publications that complement our trade shows. We also engage third-party sales agents to support our marketing efforts.
We define “organic revenue growth” and “organic revenue decline” as the growth or decline, respectively, in our revenue from one period to the next, adjusted for the revenue impact of: (i) acquisitions and dispositions, (ii) discontinued events, (iii) material show scheduling adjustments and (iv) event cancellations for which the Company has received, or expects to receive, claim proceeds from its event cancellation insurance policy. We disclose changes in Organic revenue because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing Emerald’s operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe reflect a true comparison of the trends of the existing event calendar given changes in timing or strategy. Management and Emerald’s Board of Directors evaluate changes in Organic revenues to understand underlying revenue trends of its events. Organic revenue is not defined under GAAP, and has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider such measure either in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations include that Organic revenue reflects certain adjustments that we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Organic revenue may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Organic Revenue
Organic revenue is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of performance and is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP. Organic revenue should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to revenues or other measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Also, Organic revenues is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The most directly comparable GAAP measure to Organic revenue is revenues. For a reconciliation of Organic revenues to revenues as reported, see footnote 6 to the table under the heading “Results of Operations - Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2021 to the Year Ended December 31, 2020”.
Other Income
We maintain event cancellation insurance to protect against losses due the unavoidable cancellation, postponement, relocation and enforced reduced attendance at events due to certain covered causes. Specifically, these causes include event cancellation caused by the outbreak of communicable diseases, including COVID-19 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, as well as losses caused by natural disasters such as hurricanes. However, Emerald’s renewed event cancellation insurance policies for the calendar year 2022 do not cover losses due to event cancellations caused by the outbreak of communicable diseases, including COVID-19. Our Other Income is primarily comprised of received or confirmed event cancellation insurance claim proceeds.
Cost of Revenues
•
Decorating Expenses. We work with general service contractors to both set up communal areas of our trade shows and provide services to our exhibitors, who primarily contract directly with the general service contractors. We will usually select a single general service contractor for an entire show, although it is possible to bid out packages of work within a single show on a piecemeal basis to different task-specific specialists. Decorating expenses represented 16%, 10%, and 19% of our total cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, and 6%, 4%, and 6% of our total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
•
Sponsorship Costs. We often enter into long-term sponsorship agreements with industry trade associations whereby the industry trade association endorses and markets the show to its members in exchange for a percentage of the show’s revenue. Sponsorship costs represented 9%, 34%, and 17% of our total cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, and 3%, 15%, and 6% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
•
Venue Costs. Venue costs represent rental costs for the venues, usually convention centers or hotels, where we host our trade shows. Given that convention centers are typically owned by local governments who have a vested interest in stimulating business activity in and attracting tourism to their cities, venue costs typically represent a small percentage of our total cost of revenues. Venue costs represented 13%, 9%, and 12% of our total cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, 5%, 4% and 4% of our total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.
•
Costs of Other Marketing Services. Costs of other marketing services represent paper, printing, postage, contributor and other costs related to digital media and print publications. Costs of other marketing services represented 10%, 9%, and 6% of our total cost of revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, 4%, 4%, and 2% of our total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
•
Other Event-Related Expenses. Other event-related costs include temporary labor for services such as security, shuttle buses, speaker fees, food and beverage expenses and event cancellation insurance. Other event-related expenses represented 51%, 39%, and 46% of our total cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, and 20%, 18%, and 16% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
•
Labor Costs. Labor costs represent the cost of employees who are involved in sales, marketing, planning and administrative activities. The actual on-site set-up of the events is contracted out to third-party vendors and is included in cost of revenues. Labor costs represented 67%, 68%, and 61% of our total selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, and 66%, 63%, and 22% of our total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
•
Miscellaneous Expenses. Miscellaneous expenses are comprised of a variety of other expenses, including advertising and marketing costs, promotion costs, credit card fees, travel expenses, printing costs, office supplies and office rental expense. Miscellaneous expenses represented 33%, 32%, and 39% of our total selling, general and administrative expenses, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, and 32%, 30%, and 15% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
Interest Expense
Interest expense represents interest payments and refinancing fees paid to our lenders. On May 22, 2017, we refinanced our senior secured credit facilities with the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities (the “2017 Refinancing”). We further amended the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities in November 2017 to reduce the applicable interest rates. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 principally represented interest paid in respect of our Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities.
Depreciation and Amortization
We have historically grown our business through acquisitions and, in doing so, have acquired significant intangible assets, the value of some of which is amortized over time. These acquired intangible assets, unless determined to be indefinite-lived, are amortized over extended periods of ten to thirty years from the date of each acquisition for reporting under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) purposes, or fifteen years for tax purposes. This amortization expense reduces our taxable income. Depreciation expense relates to property and equipment and represented approximately 1%, 1%, and less than 1% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense consists of U.S. federal, state and local taxes based on income in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
We record deferred tax charges or benefits primarily associated with our utilization or generation of net operating loss carryforwards and book-to-tax differences related to amortization of goodwill, amortization of intangibles assets, depreciation, stock-based compensation charges and deferred financing costs.
Cash Flow Model
We have favorable cash flow characteristics, as described below (see “-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Cash Flows”), as a result of our high profit margins, low capital expenditures and consistently negative working capital, excluding cash on hand. Our working capital, excluding cash on hand, is negative as our current assets are generally lower than our current liabilities. Current assets primarily include accounts receivable and prepaid expenses, while current liabilities primarily include accounts payable, borrowings under our Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility (the “Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility”) and deferred revenues. Cash received prior to an event is recorded as deferred revenue on our balance sheet and recognized as revenue upon completion of each trade show. The implication of having negative working capital, excluding cash on hand, is that changes in working capital represent a source of cash as our business grows. As a result of COVID-19, the accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances related to cancelled events have been reclassified to Cancelled event liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, as the net amount represents balances which we expect will be
refunded to our customers. While we believe that our business interruption insurance proceeds will largely mitigate this liability, cash outflows for customer refunds will likely exceed insurance claim settlement cash inflows for the foreseeable future.
The primary driver for our negative working capital, excluding cash on hand, is the sales cycle for a trade show, which typically begins during the twelve months prior to a show. In the interim period between the current show and the following show, we continue to sell to new and past exhibitors and collect payments on contracted exhibit space. Most of our exhibitors pay in full in advance of each trade show, whereas the bulk of expenses are paid close to or after the show. Cash deposits start to be received as early as twelve months prior to a show taking place and the balance of booth space fees are typically received in cash one month prior to a show taking place. This highly efficient cash flow model, where cash is received in advance of expenses to be paid, creates a working capital benefit.
Free Cash Flow
In addition to net cash provided by operating activities presented in accordance with GAAP, we present Free Cash Flow because we believe it is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated from our core operations that, after capital expenditures, can be used for the repayment of indebtedness, paying of dividends, repurchasing of shares of our common stock and strategic initiatives, including investing in our business and making strategic acquisitions.
Free Cash Flow is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of liquidity and is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP. Free Cash Flow should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities or other measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Also, Free Cash Flow is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The most directly comparable GAAP measure to Free Cash Flow is net cash provided by operating activities. For a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to net cash provided by operating activities, see footnote 6 to the table under the heading “Results of Operations - Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2021 to the Year Ended December 31, 2020”.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure of our performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss before (i) interest expense, (ii) income tax (benefit), (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) stock-based compensation, (v) deferred revenue adjustment, (vi) goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, (vii) material show scheduling adjustments, and (viii) other items that management believes are not part of our core operations. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance.
Management and our Board of Directors use Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance and believe it is helpful in highlighting trends because it excludes the results of decisions that are outside the control of management, while other performance metrics can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and capital investments. We reference Adjusted EBITDA frequently in our decision-making because it provides supplemental information that facilitates internal comparisons to the historical operating performance of prior periods.
Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under GAAP, and has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider such measure either in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations include that Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain normal recurring expenses and one-time cash adjustments that we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA is net loss. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, see footnote 4 to the table under the heading “Results of Operations - Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2021 to the Year Ended December 31, 2020”.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2021 to the Year Ended December 31, 2020
The tables in this section summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated.
(1)
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 included $9.4 million and $7.0 million, respectively, in contract termination, acquisition-related transaction, transition and integration costs, including legal and advisory fees.

(2)
Goodwill impairments for the year ended December 31, 2021 represents non-cash impairment of $7.2 million in connection with our October 31, 2021 goodwill impairment testing. Goodwill impairments for the year ended December 31, 2020 represents non-cash impairments of $588.2 million and $15.2 million in connection with our March 31, 2020 and October 31, 2020 goodwill impairment testing, respectively. See Note 6, Intangible Assets and Goodwill, in the notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information with respect to our non-cash goodwill impairments.
(3)
Intangible asset impairments for the year ended December 31, 2021 included non-cash impairments of $21.0 million and $11.7 million for certain customer relationship intangible assets and definite-lived trade names, and certain indefinite-lived trade names, respectively, in connection with our October 31, 2021 testing of intangible assets.

See Note 6, Intangible Assets and Goodwill, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information with respect to our non-cash intangible asset impairments.
(4)
In addition to net loss presented in accordance with GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA to measure our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance and is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net loss, cash flows from operating activities or other measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Also, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss before (i) interest expense (benefit), (ii) income tax expense, (iii) goodwill impairments, (iv) intangible asset impairments, (v) depreciation and amortization, (vi) stock-based compensation, (vii) deferred revenue adjustment and (viii) other items that management believes are not part of our core operations. Management and our Board of Directors use Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance and believe they are helpful in highlighting trends because it excludes the results of decisions that are outside the control of management, while other performance metrics can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and capital investments. We reference Adjusted EBITDA frequently in our decision-making because it provides supplemental information that facilitates internal comparisons to the historical operating performance of prior periods. Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under GAAP and has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider such measure either in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations include that Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain normal recurring expenses and one-time cash adjustments that we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operative performance. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.
(a)
Represents the non-cash goodwill impairments described in footnote 2 above.
(b)
Represents the non-cash intangible asset impairments described in footnote 3 above.
(c)
Represents costs related to stock-based compensation associated with certain employees’ participation in the 2013 Stock Option Plan (“2013 Plan”), the 2017 Omnibus Equity Plan (the “2017 Plan”) and the 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”).
(d)
Deferred revenue balances in the opening balance sheet of acquired assets and liabilities for PlumRiver and EDspaces reflected the fair value of the assumed deferred revenue performance obligations at the acquisition date. If the businesses had been continuously owned by us throughout the years presented, the deferred revenue fair value adjustment of $2.0 million, would not have been required and the revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 would have increased by $2.0 million.
(e)
Other items include amounts management believes are not representative of our core operations. Other items for the year ended December 31, 2021 included: (i) $3.1 million in transition costs, including one-time severance expense of $1.3 million and costs associated with lease abandonment of $1.2 million, (ii)
$2.7 million in non-recurring legal, audit and consulting fees (iii) $1.4 million in transaction costs in connection with certain acquisition transactions and (iv) $2.2 million in expense related to the remeasurement of contingent consideration. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the $7.0 million included: (i) $4.6 million in transition costs, including one-time severance expense of $2.8 million, (ii) $2.2 million in non-recurring legal, audit and consulting fees and (iii) $1.7 million in transaction costs in connection with certain acquisition transactions offset by (iv) $1.5 million reduction to expense related to the remeasurement of contingent consideration.
(5)
In addition to net cash provided by operating activities presented in accordance with GAAP, we present Free Cash Flow because we believe it is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated from our core operations that, after capital expenditures, can be used for the repayment of indebtedness and strategic initiatives, including investing in our business, payment of dividends, making strategic acquisitions and strengthening our balance sheet. Free Cash Flow is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of liquidity and is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP. Free Cash Flow should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or other measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Also, Free Cash Flow is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
(6)
In addition to revenues presented in accordance with GAAP, we present Organic revenue because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing Emerald’s operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe reflect a true comparison of the trends of the existing event calendar given changes in timing or strategy. Management and Emerald’s Board of Directors evaluate changes in Organic revenue to understand underlying revenue trends of its events. Our presentation of Organic revenue adjusts revenue for (i) acquisition revenue, (ii) discontinued events and (iii) COVID-19 cancellations.
Organic revenue is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of performance and is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP. Organic revenue should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to revenues or other measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Also, Organic revenue is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Represents the increase in 2021 revenues attributable to events that staged in the current year and were cancelled due to COVID-19 in the prior year.
(2)
Represents reduction in revenues attributable to certain events that were cancelled in fiscal 2021 due to COVID-19, compared to all events that staged in 2020. The Company believes the financial impact, net of costs saved, will be partially offset by event cancellation insurance proceeds from pending claims.

Goodwill Impairments
As a result of our annual goodwill impairment assessment, management recorded a $7.2 million non-cash charge related to the impairment of goodwill as of October 31, 2021.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented to prevent its spread, during the first quarter of 2020, we determined that the COVID-19 outbreak would continue to have a material negative impact on our financial results even following the time when the outbreak is contained. These factors, as well as uncertainty around when we would be able to resume normal operations, caused a significant and prolonged decline in our stock price, resulting in our market capitalization falling below the Company’s carrying value. As a result, we determined that a triggering event occurred and performed a quantitative assessment of the Company’s fair value as of March 31, 2020. In connection with this assessment management recorded a $588.2 million non-cash charge related to the impairment of goodwill. In addition, as a result of our annual goodwill impairment assessment, management recorded an additional $15.2 million non-cash charge related to the impairment of goodwill as of October 31, 2020.
Intangible Asset Impairments
As a result of our annual impairment assessment as of October 31, 2021, management recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $32.7 million, which included non-cash impairment charges of $21.0 million and $11.7 million for certain customer relationship intangible assets and definite-lived trade names, and certain indefinite-lived trade names, respectively.
Due to the triggering event in the first quarter of 2020 described above, management performed impairment assessments of our long-lived assets and indefinite-lived assets. The assessments resulted in the recognition of a non-cash impairment charge of $59.4 million, which included non-cash impairment charges for certain of our long-lived customer relationship and trade name intangible assets, and certain of our indefinite-lived trade name intangible assets of $13.2 million and $46.2 million, respectively. As a result of our annual impairment assessment as of October 31, 2020, management recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $17.4 million, which included non-cash impairment charges for certain of our long-lived customer relationship and trade name intangible assets, and certain of our indefinite-lived trade name intangible assets of $16.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively.
Commerce Segment
Revenues
During the year ended December 31, 2021, revenues for the Commerce segment of $57.3 million increased by $0.4 million, or 0.7% from $56.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The primary driver of the increase was $44.6 million in revenues related to live events that staged primarily in the second half of 2021 but were cancelled due to COVID-19 in the prior year. This increase was offset by a $38.7 million reduction from the cancellation of nearly all events scheduled to stage in the first half of 2021 due to COVID-19. The remaining $5.6 million decline in revenues was primarily due to a $4.1 million, or 43.4%, decrease in revenues from two events that staged in both 2021 and 2020. This decline was largely attributable to one event that staged pre-COVID in January 2020 and was the Company’s only large event to stage in the first half of 2021. This decrease was offset by a $1.1 million increase in print and digital advertising and virtual event revenues. Discontinued other marketing services representing $2.7 million of 2020 revenues also impacted the current year results.
Other Income
Other income of $59.3 million was recorded for the Commerce segment related to event cancellation insurance proceeds during the year ended December 31, 2021. All $59.3 million was received during 2021.
Other income of $70.3 million was recorded for the Commerce segment related to event cancellation insurance proceeds during the year ended December 31, 2020. Of the $70.3 million, $61.3 million was received and $9.0 million was confirmed by the insurance provider during 2020. All $9.0 million of insurance receivables for the Commerce segment as of December 31, 2020 were received in January 2021.
Cost of Revenues
During the year ended December 31, 2021, cost of revenues for the Commerce reportable segment decreased $6.5 million, or 26.4%, to $18.1 million from $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The primary drivers of the decrease were a $12.8 million decline in expense from events that were cancelled due to COVID-19 in 2021, but staged in 2020, a $1.7 million decline from events that were cancelled in both years due to COVID-19 and $1.0 million in cost savings from several small discontinued events. These declines were offset by $9.0 million in cost of revenues related to live events that staged in 2021 but were cancelled in 2020 due to COVID-19.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
During the year ended December 31, 2021 selling, general and administrative expenses for the Commerce reportable segment decreased $2.9 million, or 10.4%, to $24.9 million from $27.8 million for the comparable period in 2020. The decrease was primarily related to lower compensation and benefits expense attributable to the centralization initiatives implemented over the prior year, lower sales commissions related to lower revenues, avoided promotional and travel costs related to cancelled events, as well as credit card fee savings during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense
Depreciation and amortization expense attributable to the Commerce segment of $24.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $2.1 million, or 9.6%, from $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to higher amortization on the definite-lived trade name and customer relationship intangible assets.
Goodwill Impairments
In connection with our 2021 annual impairment assessment, management recorded a $7.2 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to reporting units under the Commerce segment.
During 2020, we recorded $367.5 million non-cash goodwill impairment charges in connection with reporting units under the Commerce segment in relation to our interim and annual impairment assessments. Refer to the consolidated goodwill impairment discussion under the heading, Goodwill Impairment, above in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion on goodwill impairment.
Intangible Asset Impairments
In connection with our 2021 annual impairment assessment, management recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $30.1 million for intangible assets related to the Commerce segment. The non-cash charges included $21.0 million for certain definite-lived customer relationship and trade names intangible assets, and $9.1 million for certain indefinite-lived trade name intangible assets.
In connection with the triggering event in the first quarter of 2020 described above, we performed impairment assessments of long-lived assets and indefinite-lived assets and recorded non-cash impairment charges related to long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets under the Commerce segment of $6.7 million and $24.0 million, respectively. In relation to our annual impairment assessment performed as of October 31, 2020, we recorded additional non-cash impairment charges related to related to long-lived assets under the Commerce segment of $15.2 million. During 2020, we recorded total non-cash impairment charges related to long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets under the Commerce segment of $21.9 million and $24.0 million, respectively.
Design and Technology Segment
Revenues
During the year ended December 31, 2021, revenues for the Design and Technology segment of $55.4 million increased by $4.2 million, or 8.2%, from $51.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The primary drivers of the increase were $34.1 million in revenues related to live events that staged primarily in the second half of 2021 but were cancelled due to COVID-19 in the prior year and an increase of $0.7 million, or 20.9%, for live events that staged in both years. These increases were partially offset by a $30.3 million reduction from the cancellation of nearly all live events scheduled to stage in the first half of 2021 due to COVID-19.
Other Income
Other income of $12.3 million was recorded for the Design and Technology segment related to event cancellation insurance claims during the year ended December 31, 2021. All $12.3 million was received during 2021.
Other income of $32.5 million was recorded for the Design and Technology segment related to event cancellation insurance claims proceeds during the year ended December 31, 2020. Of the $32.5 million, $24.8 million was received and $7.7 million was confirmed by the insurance provider during 2020. All $7.7 million of insurance receivables for the Technology and Design segment as of December 31, 2020 were received in January 2021.
Cost of Revenues
During the year ended December 31, 2021, cost of revenues for the Design and Technology segment of $27.0 million increased by $1.3 million, or 5.1%, from $25.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The primary drivers of the increase were $15.8 million related to live events that staged primarily in the second half of 2021 but were cancelled due to COVID-19 in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by a $14.3 million reduction from the cancellation of nearly all events scheduled to stage in the first half of 2021 due to COVID-19.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
During the year ended December 31, 2021, selling, general and administrative expenses for the Design and Technology segment of $22.4 million decreased by $0.6 million, or 2.6%, from $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily related to lower compensation and benefits expense attributable to the centralization initiatives implemented over the prior year, lower external commission expense, as well as credit card fee savings during the year ended December 31, 2021, partly offset by higher marketing costs.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense
During the year ended December 31, 2021, depreciation and amortization expense for the Design and Technology segment of $14.9 million decreased $1.5 million, or 9.1%, from $16.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was due to lower amortization on the definite-lived trade name and customer relationship intangible assets which were impaired in the first and fourth quarters of 2020.
Goodwill Impairments
During 2020, we recorded $205.7 million non-cash goodwill impairment charges in connection with reporting units under the Design and Technology segment in relation to our interim and annual impairment assessments. Refer to the consolidated goodwill impairment discussion under the heading, Goodwill Impairment, above in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion on goodwill impairment.
Intangible Asset Impairments
In connection with our 2021 annual impairment assessment, management recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2.6 million for intangible assets related to the Design and Technology segment. The non-cash charges included a $2.6 million for certain indefinite-lived trade name intangible assets.
In connection with the triggering event in the first quarter of 2020, we performed impairment assessments of long-lived assets and indefinite-lived assets and recorded non-cash impairment charges related to long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets under the Design and Technology segment of $5.7 million and $17.0 million, respectively. In relation to our 2020 annual impairment assessment performed as of October 31, 2020, we recorded additional non-cash impairment charges of $1.6 million and $0.6 million, in connection with long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively, under the Design and Technology segment. During 2020, we recorded total non-cash impairment charges related to long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets under the Design and Technology segment of $7.3 million and $17.6 million, respectively.
All Other Category
Revenues
During the year ended December 31, 2021, revenue attributable to the All Other category of $32.8 million increased by $13.5 million, or 69.9%, from $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The primary drivers of the increase were incremental revenues of $14.4 million from the acquisitions of PlumRiver and Sue Bryce, which closed in December 2020 and April 2021, respectively, $6.3 million of revenue from events that staged during 2021, but were cancelled due to COVID-19 in the prior year, and a $1.3 million organic revenues increase, primarily related to print and digital advertising business. These increases were offset by $6.7 million for events that staged in 2020 but were cancelled due to COVID-19 in 2021 and a $1.6 million decline attributable to discontinued other marketing services.
Other Income
Other income of $5.8 million was recorded for the All Other category related to event cancellation insurance claims proceeds during the year ended December 31, 2021. All $5.8 million was received during 2021.
Other income of $4.2 million was recorded for All Other category related to event cancellation insurance claims proceeds during the year ended December 31, 2020. Of the $4.2 million, $3.0 million was received and $1.2 million was confirmed by the insurance provider during 2020. All $1.2 million of insurance receivables for the All Other category as of December 31, 2020 were received in January 2021.
Cost of Revenues
During the year ended December 31, 2021, cost of revenues attributable to the All Other category of $10.4 million increased by $3.1 million, or 42.5%, from $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The primary drivers of the increase were $2.3 million in additional expense for events that staged during the current year, but were cancelled due to COVID-19 in 2020, and incremental costs of $2.0 million from the acquisitions of PlumRiver and Sue Bryce, which closed in December 2020 and April 2021, respectively. These increases were partly offset by decreases of $0.6 million in expense related to events that were either cancelled due to COVID-19 during the current year, but staged in 2020 or cancelled in both years due to COVID-19, and a decrease of $0.5 million in expense related to discontinued virtual events and other marketing services.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
During the year ended December 31, 2021, selling, general and administrative expenses for the All Other category of $27.4 million increased by $14.1 million, from $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense was primarily driven by the acquisitions of PlumRiver and Sue Bryce in December 2020 and April 2021, respectively.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense
Depreciation and amortization expense for the All Other category of $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased $1.1 million, or 14.9%, from $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was due to lower amortization on the definite-lived trade name and customer relationship intangible assets which were impaired in the first and fourth quarters of 2020.
Goodwill Impairments
During 2020, we recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $30.2 million in connection with reporting units under the All Other category in relation to our interim and annual impairment assessments. Refer to the consolidated goodwill impairment discussion under the heading, Goodwill Impairment, above in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion on goodwill impairment.
Intangible Asset Impairments
In connection with the triggering event in the first quarter of 2020 described above, we performed impairment assessments of long-lived assets and indefinite-lived assets and recorded non-cash impairment charges related to long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets under the All Other category of $0.8 million and $5.2 million, respectively.
Corporate
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
During the year ended December 31, 2021, selling, general and administrative expenses of $68.3 million for corporate-level activity increased by $13.8 million, or 25.3%, from $54.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense was primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits expense, higher stock-based compensation costs and higher transition costs, including one-time severance expense.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense
Depreciation and amortization expense relating to corporate-level activity of $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased $0.5 million, or 17.2%, from $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Interest Expense; Benefit from Income Taxes; Net Loss; Adjusted EBITDA
Interest Expense
Interest expense of $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased $4.8 million, or 23.3%, from $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the variable interest rate on our Amended and Restated Term Loan Facility, for which the average rate during 2021 was 2.60%, compared to 3.28% during 2020, and a $0.9 million decrease in interest expense related to lower borrowings under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility.
Benefit from Income Taxes
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded a benefit from income taxes of $1.3 million and $57.6 million, respectively. The decrease in our benefit from income taxes of $56.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to the impact of lower non-cash charges related to goodwill and intangible asset impairments, offset by lower other income and higher operating losses incurred as a result of the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Net Loss
Net loss of $78.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased $555.5 million from net loss of $633.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The key drivers of the decrease in net loss were the decreases in non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and interest expense, partly offset by the higher corporate overhead expense and lower benefits from income taxes described above.
Adjusted EBITDA
Total Adjusted EBITDA of $45.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased $26.2 million, or 36.4%, from $71.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to lower other income related to event cancellation insurance proceeds received or confirmed during the year as well as lower operating profits as a result of the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with GAAP. For a discussion of our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, see footnote 4 to the table under the heading “Results of Operations - Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2021 to the Year Ended December 31, 2020”.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations, including working capital needs, debt service, acquisitions, other commitments and contractual obligations. We consider liquidity in terms of cash flows from operations and their sufficiency to fund our operating and investing activities.
In March 2020, the World Health Organization categorized the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) as a pandemic, and the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency. In conjunction with this declaration and the spread of COVID-19 across the United States, recommendations and mandates were handed down by various local, state and federal government agencies regarding social distancing, containment areas and against large gatherings, as well as quarantine requirements. In addition, travel restrictions were imposed by the United States and foreign governments, and by companies with respect to their employees, and various event venues announced indefinite closures. As a result of these and various other factors, management made the decision to cancel substantially all of our face-to-face events scheduled through the end of 2020. In addition, beginning in October 2020, management announced the cancellation or postponement of numerous live events that were scheduled for the first half of 2021, including all but several relatively small live events staging in the first six months of 2021. Following the reopening of most major municipalities in the United States in June 2021, we traded 56 in-person events. As expected, the continued effects of COVID-19 related issues such as international travel restrictions and the need to postpone several events, negatively impacted the financial results of the Company’s fiscal year 2021. While travel restrictions on international travelers to the United States were lifted in the fourth quarter of 2021, the ongoing effects of COVID-19 on the Company’s operations and event calendar have had, and will continue to have, a material negative impact on its financial results and liquidity, and such negative impact may continue beyond the containment of such outbreak.
The assumptions used to estimate our liquidity are subject to greater uncertainty because we have never previously cancelled or postponed all upcoming events for a period of over a year due to a pandemic where the timing for resolution and ultimate impact of the pandemic remains uncertain. Management cannot estimate with certainty (i) when we will be able to resume full event operations and, once resumed, (ii) whether event exhibitors and attendees will attend our events. Therefore, current estimates of revenues and the associated impact on liquidity
could differ materially in the future. As a consequence, management cannot estimate the ultimate impact on our business, financial condition or near or longer term financial or operational results. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, we implemented several actions to preserve cash and strengthen the Company’s liquidity position, including, but not limited to:
•
Completing the sale of its 7% Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock, generating net proceeds of $382.7 million;
•
Reducing its expense structure across all key areas of discretionary spending;
•
Significantly reducing the use of outside contractors; and
•
Suspending the previous quarterly cash dividend.
Further, Emerald maintains event cancellation insurance to protect against losses due to the unavoidable cancellation, postponement, relocation and enforced reduced attendance at events due to certain covered events. Specifically, for the policies covering calendar years 2021 and 2020, Emerald is insured for losses due to event cancellations caused by the outbreak of communicable diseases, including COVID-19. However, Emerald’s renewed event cancellation insurance policies for the calendar year 2022 do not cover losses due to event cancellations caused by the outbreak of communicable diseases, including COVID-19. In addition, coverage for each of our event cancellation insurance policies extends to include additional promotional and marketing expenses necessarily incurred by us should a covered loss occur. These policies also include a terrorism endorsement covering an act of terrorism and/or threat of terrorism directed at the insured event or within the United States or its territories. The aggregate limit under these event cancellation insurance policies is approximately $191.1 million in 2020, $191.4 million in 2021 and $100.0 million in 2022 if losses arise for reasons within the scope of these policies.
In addition to these primary policies, Emerald maintains separate event cancellation insurance policies for the Surf Expo Summer 2020, Surf Expo Winter 2021, Surf Expo Winter 2022 and Surf Expo Summer 2022 shows, with respective coverage limits of $6.0 million, $7.7 million, $8.4 million and $6.5 million. Similar to the primary event cancellation insurance policies, coverage for the outbreak of communicable disease, including COVID-19, is included for the policies covering Surf Expo Summer 2020 and Surf Expo Winter 2021, but not included for the policies covering Surf Expo Winter 2022 and Surf Expo Summer 2022.
We are in the process of pursuing claims under the 2021 and 2020 event cancellation insurance policies to offset the financial impact of cancelled and postponed events as a result of COVID-19. To date, we have submitted claims related to impacted or cancelled events previously scheduled to take place in 2020 and 2021 of approximately $167.0 million and $82.3 million, respectively. Other income recognized to date, related to insurance proceeds received or confirmed on the claims related to events previously scheduled to take place in 2021 and 2021, totaled $43.0 million and $141.4 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded Other income of $77.4 million and $107.0 million, respectively, related to event cancellation insurance claim proceeds deemed to be realizable. All of the $77.4 million in Other income was received in 2021. Outstanding claims are subject to review and adjustment and there is no guarantee or assurance as to the amount or timing of future recoveries from Emerald’s event cancellation insurance policies.
On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), which provides for the ability of employers to delay payment of employer payroll taxes during 2020 after the date of enactment. As a result, the payment approximately $1.8 million of our employer payroll taxes otherwise due in 2020 will be delayed, with 50% due by December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% due by December 31, 2022. The Company paid $0.9 million of the deferred employer payroll taxes in December 2021.
As of December 31, 2021, we had $519.7 million of borrowings outstanding under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Facility, which included unamortized deferred financing fees of $1.9 million and unamortized original issue discount of $1.4 million, with an additional $109.0 million available to borrow (after giving effect to $1.0 million letters of credit outstanding) under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under our Amended and Restated Term Loan Facility are subject to mandatory prepayments under specified circumstances, including 50.0% of Excess Cash Flow, subject to step-downs to 25% and 0% of excess cash flow at certain leverage based thresholds, and with 100% of the net cash proceeds of asset sales and casualty events in
excess of certain thresholds (subject to certain reinvestment rights). If these thresholds are triggered, we would be required to make these mandatory prepayments. See “--Long-Term Debt-Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities” below for more detail regarding the terms of our Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities.
Based on these actions, assumptions regarding the impact of COVID-19, and expected insurance recoveries, we believe that the Company’s current financial resources will be sufficient to fund its liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months.
Dividend Policy
We paid a dividend of $0.0725 per share in the first quarter of 2019 and $0.0750 per share in each of the second, third and fourth quarters of 2019 and first quarter of 2020. On March 20, 2020, due to the negative impact of COVID-19 on our business, our Board of Directors temporarily suspended the Company’s regular quarterly cash dividend on its common stock. The payment of any such dividend in future quarters is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and depending upon our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable laws and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant, and the amount of any future dividend payment may be changed or terminated in the future at any time and for any reason without advance notice.
Our business is conducted through our subsidiaries. Dividends, distributions and other payments from, and cash generated by, our subsidiaries will be our principal sources of cash to repay indebtedness, fund operations and pay dividends. Accordingly, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders is dependent on the earnings and distributions of funds from our subsidiaries. In addition, the covenants in the agreements governing our existing indebtedness, including the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities, significantly restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer assets to us. See “-Long-Term Debt”, “Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock-Because we are a holding company with no operations of our own, we rely on dividends, distributions, and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries” and “Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock-We cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.”
Share Repurchases
Our Board of Directors approved a $30.0 million share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2019. We settled the repurchase of 853,557 shares of our common stock for $8.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The $30.0 million share repurchase program was discontinued in the first quarter of 2020.
On October 5, 2020, our Board of Directors authorized and approved a new $20.0 million share repurchase program (the “October 2020 share repurchase program”. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through and including December 31, 2021, subject to early termination or extension by the Board of Directors, through open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated purchases or otherwise. The Company repurchased 2,498,118 shares for $12.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 under this repurchase program. There was $6.8 million remaining available for share repurchases under the October 2020 Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2021.
On October 29, 2021, our Board of Directors approved extension and expansion of the October 2020 share repurchase program, which allows for the repurchase of $20.0 million of our Common Stock through December 31, 2022, subject to early termination or extension by the Board of Directors. The share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes the changes to our cash flows for the periods presented:
Operating Activities
Operating activities consist primarily of net loss adjusted for noncash items that include goodwill and intangible asset impairments, depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, amortization of deferred financing fees and debt discount, share-based compensation, plus the effect of changes during the period in our working capital.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $127.1 million to $90.0 million provided by operating activities, from $37.1 million used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $150.8 million increase in cash generated by working capital, from $62.9 million in cash generated by working capital during the current year compared to the use of $87.9 million in cash for working capital during the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to higher deferred revenues, partially offset by higher accounts receivable, related to increased sales activity as our live events begin to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the receipt of event cancellation insurance claim proceeds during the current year. These working capital improvements were partially offset by refunds paid to customers for live events that were cancelled or postponed due to COVID-19 during 2020 and 2021. Net loss and non-cash adjustments to net loss generated $27.1 million in cash during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $50.8 million in cash generated during the prior year. The primary driver of this decline was lower non-cash goodwill and impairment addbacks offset by lower net loss and deferred income tax benefit addbacks during the current year.
Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $104.9 million to $37.1 million used in operating activities, from $67.8 million provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a $583.6 million increase in net loss and a $70.1 million increase in cash used for working capital. These were partially offset by a $548.8 million increase in non-cash reconciling adjustments driven by increases in non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $534.3 million and $59.8 million, respectively, partly offset by decreases of $42.7 million for deferred income taxes and $3.4 million for depreciation and amortization.
Investing Activities
Investing activities consist of business acquisitions and purchases of other productive assets, investments in information technology and capital expenditures to furnish or upgrade our offices.
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $94.6 million to $131.9 million from $37.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to increased aggregate cash used for business acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2021 of $125.3 million compared to $33.3 million in the prior year. The Company completed two business acquisitions in each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $20.6 million, or 123.4%, to $37.3 million from $16.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to increased cash used for business acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the
prior year. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed two acquisitions for cash consideration of $33.3 million, while during the year ended December 31, 2019, we completed one acquisition in the prior year for aggregate cash consideration of $12.8 million. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $58.0 million, or 77.6%, to $16.7 million from $74.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. See Note 4, Business Acquisitions, in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information with respect to the acquisitions. We have minimal capital expenditure requirements. Capital expenditures totaled $6.6 million, $4.0 million and $3.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Financing Activities
Financing activities primarily consist of borrowing and repayments on our debt to fund business acquisitions and our operations.
Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $22.2 million, comprised of $12.4 million in share repurchases associated with our publicly announced share repurchase programs, $5.7 million in repayments of principal on our Amended and Restated Term Loan Facilities and $4.2 million in payments of deferred consideration related to business acquisitions. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $360.1 million, comprised of $382.7 million of net proceeds for issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock, partly offset by $10.0 million in repayments net of borrowings on our Amended and Restated Senior Revolving Credit Facility, $5.4 million in cash dividend payments, $0.9 million in share repurchases associated with our publicly announced share repurchase programs, $5.7 million in repayments of principal on our Amended and Restated Term Loan Facilities and a $0.8 million payment of deferred consideration related to a business acquisition. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $62.0 million, comprised of $46.0 million in repayments of borrowings on our Amended and Restated Senior Revolving Credit Facility, $21.3 million in quarterly cash dividend payments, $8.3 million in share repurchases associated with our publicly announced share repurchase programs, $5.7 million in repayments of principal on our Amended and Restated Term Loan Facilities and a $1.0 million payment of deferred consideration related to a business acquisition. These were offset by net proceeds of $16.0 million borrowings on our Amended and Restated Senior Revolving Credit Facility and $4.3 million in proceeds from common stock issuances related to the exercise of employee equity awards.
Free Cash Flow
Free Cash Flow of $83.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $124.5 million, from outflow of $41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Free Cash Flow of negative $41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $105.0 million, from inflow of $63.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Free Cash Flow is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with GAAP. For a discussion of our presentation of Free Cash Flow, see footnote 5 to the table under the heading “Results of Operations - Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2021 to the Year Ended December 31, 2020”.
Off-Balance Sheet Commitments
We are not party to, and do not typically enter into any, off-balance sheet arrangements.
Long-Term Debt
Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities
On February 14, 2020, Emerald Events Holding, Inc., the borrower under the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities, was renamed Emerald X, Inc (“Emerald X”). The Amended and Restated Term Loan Facilities include a seven-year $565.0 million senior secured term loan facility, scheduled to mature on May 22, 2024 (the “Amended and Restated Term Loan Facility”) and an Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below).
The Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities allows for Emerald X to choose from the following two interest rate options:
-
Alternate Base Rate (“ABR”) loans bear interest at a rate equal to a spread, or applicable margin, above the greatest of (i) the administrative agent’s prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, and (iii) the one month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 1.00%.
or
-LIBOR loans bear interest at a rate equal to a spread, or applicable margin, over the LIBOR rate.
The spread, or applicable margin, was 1.75% for ABR loans and 2.75% for LIBOR loans through August 6, 2020. Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, (i) the applicable margin steps down by 0.25% if Emerald X’s Total First Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities) is lower than 2.75 to 1.00 and (ii) the applicable margin under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility (but not the Amended and Restated Term Loan Facility) steps down by an additional 0.25% if Emerald X’s Total First Lien Net Leverage Ratio is less than 2.50 to 1.00. As a result of Company’s Total First Lien Net Leverage Ratio decreasing below 2.50 to 1.00 (as defined below), from August 7, 2020 through December 31, 2020, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility were subject to an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.25% or ABR plus 1.25%.
The Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities also include an uncommitted incremental facility which, subject to certain conditions, provides for additional term loans in the sum of:
(X)
(i) if the incremental loans are first lien loans, an amount such that the Total First Lien Net Leverage ratio does not exceed 4.00:1.00,
(ii) if the incremental loans are junior lien loans, an amount such that the Total Net Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities) does not exceed 4.00:1.00,
(iii) if the incremental loans are unsecured, an amount such that either the Total Net Leverage Ratio does not exceed 5.00:1.00 or the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities) is not less than 2.00:1.00, or, in each case, if the incremental loans are incurred with a permitted acquisition, an amount such that the applicable leverage ratio will not increase as a result of the permitted acquisition (on a pro forma basis giving effect to the incremental loans); plus
(Y)an amount equal to certain prior voluntary prepayments, loan buybacks and commitment reductions of loans under the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities, plus
(Z)an amount equal to the greater of $160 million and 100% of Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA (which is defined as “Consolidated EBITDA” in the credit agreement governing the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities).
On June 25, 2021, Emerald X entered into a Third Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Amendment”), by and among Emerald X, as Borrower, the guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, which amends that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of May 22, 2017. Pursuant to the Amendment, the existing Credit Agreement was modified as follows:
•
The maturity of the revolving commitments under the Credit Agreement was extended by 18 months to November 23, 2023;
•
The aggregate revolving commitments under the Credit Agreement was reduced from $150,000,000 to $110,000,000;
•
A condition to future revolving advances was added such that the Borrower is only permitted to borrow new revolving loans if the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash of the Borrower and its consolidated subsidiaries is no more than $40,000,000 (subject to certain exceptions and exclusions); and
•
From and after the effective date of the Amendment, certain dividends and distributions to stockholders will be limited to the greater of (i) $40,000,000 and (ii) 35% of the cumulative amount of Consolidated EBITDA (excluding proceeds of event cancellation insurance), with amounts incurred in reliance on clause (i) above not to exceed $20,000,000 in any one fiscal year.
Emerald X is required to pay a quarterly commitment fee in respect of the unutilized commitments under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility in an amount equal to 0.50% per annum, calculated on the unused portion of the facility, which may be reduced to 0.375% upon achievement of a Total First Lien Ratio of 3.50 to 1.50. Upon the issuance of letters of credit under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility, Emerald X is required to pay fronting fees, customary issuance and administration fees and a letter of credit fee equal to the then-applicable margin (as determined by reference to LIBOR) for the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility.
The Amended and Restated Term Loan Facility requires repayment in equal quarterly installments of 0.25% of the $565.0 million, with the balance due at maturity. Installment payments on the Amended and Restated Term Loan Facility are due on the last business day of each quarter, commencing on September 29, 2017.
Subject to the certain customary exceptions and limitations, Emerald X. is required to prepay amounts outstanding under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Facility under specified circumstances, including 50.0% of Excess Cash Flow (“ECF”), subject to step-downs to 25% and 0% of excess cash flow at certain leverage based thresholds, and with 100% of the net cash proceeds of asset sales and casualty events in excess of certain thresholds (subject to certain reinvestment rights).
All obligations under the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Facility are guaranteed by Emerald X’s direct parent company and, subject to certain exceptions, by all of Emerald X’s direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2021, all of Emerald X’s subsidiaries and Emerald X’s direct parent have provided guarantees.
Subject to certain limitations, the obligations under the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities are secured by a perfected first priority security interest in substantially all tangible and intangible assets owned by Emerald X or by any guarantor.
The Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain a number of customary incurrence-based covenants imposing certain restrictions on our business, including limitations on indebtedness; limitations on liens; limitations on certain fundamental changes (including, without limitation, mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions); limitations on asset sales; limitations on dividends and other restricted payments; limitations on investments, loans and advances; limitations on certain repayments of subordinated indebtedness; limitations on transactions with affiliates; limitations on changes in fiscal periods; limitations on agreements restricting liens and/or dividends; and limitations on changes in lines of business.
Certain of these incurrence-based covenants restrict, subject to various exceptions, our ability to take certain actions (such as incurring additional secured and unsecured indebtedness, making certain investments and paying certain dividends) unless we meet certain minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or maximum Total First Lien Net Leverage Ratio and/or Total Net Secured Leverage Ratio standards. These ratios are calculated on the basis of our Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA (which is defined as “Consolidated EBITDA” in the credit agreement governing the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities), calculated on a trailing four-quarter basis.
In addition, the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility contains a financial maintenance covenant (the “Financial Covenant”) requiring Emerald X to comply with a 5.50 to 1.00 Total First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, which is defined as the ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities) secured on a first lien basis, net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (“Total First Lien Net Debt”) to Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA. This financial covenant is tested quarterly only if the aggregate amount of revolving loans, swingline loans and letters of credit outstanding under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility (net of up to $10.0 million of outstanding letters of credit) exceeds 35% of the total commitments thereunder. We were not required to test the Financial Covenant at December 31, 2021 or 2020.
Events of default under the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities include, among others, nonpayment of principal when due; nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts; cross-defaults; covenant defaults; material inaccuracy of representations and warranties; certain bankruptcy and insolvency events; material unsatisfied or unstayed judgments; certain ERISA events; change of control; or actual or asserted invalidity of any guarantee or security document.
As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the terms of the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities.
Modifications to our Debt Agreements
We may, from time to time, repurchase or otherwise retire or extend our debt and/or take other steps to reduce our debt, lower our interest payments or otherwise improve our financial position. These actions may include open market debt repurchases, negotiated repurchases, other retirements of outstanding debt and/or opportunistic refinancing, amendment or repricing of debt. The amount of debt that may be repurchased or otherwise retired or refinanced, if any, will depend on market conditions, trading levels of our debt, our cash position, compliance with debt covenants and other considerations. Our affiliates may also purchase our debt from time to time, through open market purchases or other transactions. In such cases, our debt may not be retired, in which case we would continue to pay interest in accordance with the terms of the debt, and we would continue to reflect the debt as outstanding in our consolidated balance sheets.
Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments
The table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021.
(1)
We have entered into certain contractual obligations to secure trade show venues. These agreements are not unilaterally cancellable by us, are legally enforceable and specify fixed or minimum amounts or quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices.
(2)
Represents principal obligations with respect to borrowings under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Facility.
(3)
Represents principal obligations with respect to borrowings under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility.
(4)
We have entered into certain operating leases for real estate facilities. These agreements are not unilaterally cancellable by us, are legally enforceable and specify fixed or minimum amounts of rents payable at fixed or minimum prices.
(5)
Represents interest expense on borrowings under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Facility using the interest rates in effect at December 31, 2021. Actual cash flows may differ significantly due to changes in underlying estimates.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies, some of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. Since future events and their impact cannot be determined with absolute certainty, the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates.
We believe the application of our accounting policies, and the estimates inherently required therein, are reasonable. Our accounting policies and estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change.
The policies and estimates discussed below involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies that are material to our consolidated financial statements. With respect to critical accounting policies, even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent results of operations.
Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management has discussed the selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with members of our board of directors.
We have certain accounting policies that require more significant management judgment and estimates than others. These include our accounting policies with respect to revenue recognition, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, definite-lived intangibles, share-based compensation and accounting for income taxes, which are more fully described below.
Revenue Recognition, Deferred Revenue and Allowance for Credit Losses
Trade Shows and Other Events Revenue
A significant portion of our annual revenue is generated from the production of trade shows and conference events, including booth space sales, registration fees and sponsorship fees. We recognize revenue in the period the trade show or other event stages as the Company’s performance obligations have been satisfied. As a result of the COVID-19 related show cancellations described above, trade show revenues declined significantly during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Trade show and other events generated approximately 71%, 79% and 92% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Exhibitors contract for their booth space and sponsorships up to a year in advance of the trade show. Fees are typically invoiced and collected in-full prior to the trade show or event and deferred until the event takes place and all promised services have been provided and performance obligations are met. Similarly, attendees register and are typically qualified for attendance prior to the show staging. Attendee registration revenues are also collected prior to the show and deferred until the show stages. Revenue is recognized when our customer receives the benefit of the promised services and all performance obligations are met. Revenue is recognized at an amount that reflects the
consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those services. Customers receive the benefit of our services over the course of each trade show or other event for our trade shows and conference events. We recognized $103.5 million, $101.2 million and $330.7 million of trade show and other event revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Because we collect our booth space, sponsorship and attendee registration revenue prior to the trade show staging, we do not incur substantial bad debt expense, or have exposure to credit losses with relation to these revenue streams. Any trade show related receivables outstanding 60 days following the month in which a trade show stages are fully reserved in the allowance for credit losses. Bad debt expense is recognized in the consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss as selling, general and administrative expense. Accounts receivable are presented on the face of the consolidated balance sheet, net of an allowance for credit losses in 2020 and 2021.
Subscription software and services
We also offer B2B ecommerce and digital merchandising solutions, serving the needs of manufacturers and retailers, through our Elastic Suite platform. In addition to their respective revenues, these products support our live events by delivering year-round channels for customer acquisition and development. Revenue consists of subscription revenue, implementation fees and professional services. Fees associated with implementation are deferred and recognized over the expected customer life, which is four years. Subscription revenue is generally recognized over the term of the contract. The Company’s contracts associated with the subscription software and services are typically three-year terms with one-year renewals. We recognized $11.1 million, zero and zero of subscription software and services revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Other Marketing Services Revenue
The remaining portion of our revenues primarily consist of advertising sales for industry publications and digital products, which are recognized in the period in which the publications are issued or digital products are provided. Typically, the fees we charge are collected after the publications are issued. We recognized $30.9 million, $26.2 million and $30.2 million of other marketing services revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Deferred Revenue
Our deferred revenues generally consist of booth space sales, registration fees and sponsorship fees that are invoiced prior to the trade show or other event and subscription revenue, implementation fees and professional services associated with the Company’s subscription software and services. Total deferred revenues, including the current and non-current portions, were $118.3 million and $48.6 million, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
Goodwill
Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulting from acquisitions. Goodwill is not amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently should an event or circumstances indicate that a reduction in fair value of the reporting unit may have occurred. We test for impairment on October 31 of each year, or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant. Such events and circumstances may be a significant change in our business climate, economic and industry trends, legal factors, negative operating performance indicators, significant competition or changes in strategy. We perform our goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level, using a fair value method based on management’s judgments and assumptions or third party valuations. The fair value of a reporting unit refers to the price that would be expected to be received to sell the reporting unit in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
In testing goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in
an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the reporting unit. We would also be required to reduce the carrying amounts of the related assets on our balance sheet.
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires the application of judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including, projections of future cash flows, revenue growth rates, weighted average cost of capital, forecasting future sales and expenses, selecting appropriate discount rates and other factors which can be affected by changes in business climate, economic conditions, the competitive environment and other factors. We base these fair value estimates on assumptions our management believes to be reasonable but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. A change in underlying assumptions would cause a change in the results of the tests and, as such, could cause fair value to be less than the carrying amounts and result in an impairment of goodwill in the future. Additionally, if actual results are not consistent with the estimates and assumptions or if there are significant changes to our planned strategy, it may cause fair value to be less than the carrying amounts and result in additional impairments of goodwill in the future. We corroborate the reasonableness of the total fair value of the reporting unit with our market capitalization. Our market capitalization is calculated using the number of shares outstanding and stock price of our publicly traded shares. In the event of a goodwill impairment, we would be required to record an impairment, which would impact earnings and reduce the carrying amounts of goodwill on the consolidated balance sheet.
We also consider the amount of headroom for our reporting units when determining whether an impairment existed. Headroom is the difference between the fair value of a reporting unit and its carrying value. In performing our annual impairment analysis as of October 31, 2021, the fair values of the reporting units which were not impaired exceeded their carrying values by amounts ranging from zero to 458%. Of the $400.7 million of goodwill, the carrying value equals the fair value for $6.7 million as of October 31, 2021. The fair values of the respective reporting units were determined primarily by discounting estimated future cash flows, which were determined based on revenue and expense long-term growth assumptions ranging from zero to growth of 3.5%, at a weighted average cost of capital (discount rate) ranging from 12.0% to 13.5%.
Accordingly, a relatively small change in the underlying assumptions, including if the financial performance of the reporting unit does not meet expectations in future years or a decline occurs in the market price of our publicly traded stock, may cause a change in the results of the impairment assessment in future periods and, as such, could result in an impairment of goodwill, for which the carrying amount is $514.2 million as of December 31, 2021. The aggregate remaining goodwill carrying value of reporting units with impairment was $6.7 million as of December 31, 2021.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
The annual evaluation for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets is a two-step process. The first step is to perform a qualitative impairment assessment. If this qualitative assessment indicates that, more likely than not, the indefinite lived intangible assets are not impaired, then no further testing is performed. If the qualitative assessment indicates that, more likely than not, the indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired, then the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets must be calculated. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recorded for that excess.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently should an event or circumstances indicate that a reduction in fair value may have occurred. We test for impairment on October 31 of each year, or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant. Such events and circumstances may be a significant change in our business climate, economic and industry trends, legal factors, negative operating performance indicators, significant competition or changes in strategy. We perform testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, at the asset group level using the relief from royalty method. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recorded for that excess. We would also be required to reduce the carrying amounts of the related assets on our balance sheet.
See Note 6, Intangible Assets and Goodwill, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information with respect to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.
Definite-Lived Intangible Assets
Definite-lived intangible assets consist of certain trade names, acquired technology, customer relationships and other amortized intangible assets. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern of expected economic benefit. Intangible assets with finite lives are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization and impairment losses, if any.
With respect to business acquisitions, the fair values of acquired definite-lived intangibles are estimated using a relief from royalty method. Input assumptions regarding future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and tax rates used in developing the present value of future cash flow projections are the basis of the fair value calculations.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We review long-lived assets, including tangible assets and other intangible assets with definitive lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. We conduct our long-lived asset impairment analysis by grouping assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows. If the undiscounted cash flows do not indicate the carrying amount of the asset group is recoverable, an impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value based on the discounted cash flow analysis. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess. We would also be required to reduce the carrying amounts of the related assets on our balance sheet.
See Note 6, Intangible Assets and Goodwill, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information with respect to impairments of long-lived assets.
Stock-Based Compensation
We use share-based compensation, including stock options and restricted stock units, to provide long-term performance incentives for our employees and non-employee directors. We calculate stock-based compensation expense for each vesting tranche of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and recognize such costs, net of forfeitures, within the consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss; however, no expense is recognized for awards that do not ultimately vest. The determination of the grant date fair value of stock options using an option-pricing model is affected by a number of assumptions, such as the fair value of the underlying stock, our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the options, stock option forfeiture behaviors, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends, which we estimated as follows:
•
Fair Value of our Common Stock - The fair value per share of common stock for purposes of determining share-based compensation is the closing price of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the applicable grant date.
•
Expected Term - The expected option term represents the period of time the option is expected to be outstanding. The simplified method is used to estimate the term as we do not have sufficient exercise history to calculate the expected term of stock options.
•
Volatility - The expected volatility is based on considering our limited publicly traded stock price and historical average volatilities of similar publicly traded companies corresponding to the expected term of the awards.
•
Risk-Free Rate - The risk-free rate is based on the yields of United States Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of stock option for each stock option grant.
•
Forfeiture Rate - Estimates of pre-vesting forfeitures, or forfeiture rates, were based on our internal analysis, which primarily considers the award recipients’ position within the Company.
•
Dividend Yield - Prior to the IPO, we had never declared or paid any cash dividends and had no intention to pay cash dividends. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero with respect to pre-IPO options. In connection with our IPO, we adopted a policy of paying quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Our post-IPO stock option grants include an expected dividend yield which is commensurate with the annual dividends we had been paying since the IPO, until the dividend was suspended in the first quarter of 2020.
See Note 12, Stock-Based Compensation, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information with respect to stock-based compensation.
Income Taxes
We provide for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that future tax benefits associated with a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is provided. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss as an adjustment to income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date.
We record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. See Note 15, Income Taxes, in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
