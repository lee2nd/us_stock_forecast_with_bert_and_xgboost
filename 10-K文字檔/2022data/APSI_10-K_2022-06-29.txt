Plan of Operation
Over the next twelve months, we expect to incur costs and expenses related to:
- maintaining our corporate existence, such as annual fees due to the State of Nevada;
- filing periodic reports under the Exchange Act, including filing, accounting and legal fees;
- investigating and analyzing targets and possibly consummating a business transaction.
We expect to incur costs associated with filing reports under the Exchange Act over the next twelve months of approximately $25,000 to $45,000. Costs associated with investigating and analyzing targets and possibly consummating a business transaction are difficult to quantify given the multitude of variables associated with such activities. Our ongoing expenses will result in continued net operating losses that will increase until we can consummate a business transaction with a profitable target business, if ever. We estimate that these costs will be in the range of to $30,000 to $55,000 per year, and that we will be able to meet these costs as necessary, with funds from the aforementioned private placement.
Capital Resources.
We had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of March 31, 2022 and 2021.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to income taxes, and the valuation of equity transactions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Use of Estimate
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Estimates are based on historical experience, management expectations for future performance, and other assumptions as appropriate. Key areas affected by estimates include the assessment of the recoverability of long-lived assets, which is based on such factors as estimated future cash flows. We re-evaluate estimates on an ongoing basis; therefore, actual results may vary from those estimates.
Fair Values of Financial Instruments
The carrying values of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate the fair values of these instruments due to their short-term nature. The carrying amount for borrowings under the financing agreement approximates fair value because of the variable market interest rates charged for these borrowings.
