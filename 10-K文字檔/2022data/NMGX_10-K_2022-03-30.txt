Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.
The following is management’s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
OVERVIEW
Nano Magic develops, commercializes and markets consumer and industrial products powered by nanotechnology that solve everyday problems for customers in the optical, transportation, military, sports and safety industries. Our primary business is the formulation, marketing and sale of products powered by nanotechnology including the ULTRA CLARITY brand eyeglass cleaner, our defogging products and nanocoating products for glass and ceramics. We have historically sold our consumer products directly to opticians and ophthalmologists and small optical retailers and we will continue to do so, even as we are now working to expand our consumer sales by sales to big box retailers and e-commerce. We also develop and sell printable inks and pastes, thermal management materials, and graphene foils and windows. Our Innovation and Technology Center conducts development services for us and for government and private customers.
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) was first reported in Wuhan, China. Less than four months later, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Restrictions imposed by Federal, state and local governments during the pandemic affected operations of our business and those of our vendors and customers as well as logistics for shipping and receiving supplies and shipping our products.
Apart from the disruption affecting all manufacturing businesses, some of the raw materials and bottles used to produce our liquid products are used to produce hand sanitizer and other cleaning product that are in high demand and some of our raw materials and packaging were harder to find at several points during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, shortages did not continue, and we have been able to obtain adequate supply. As the pandemic has continued, lead times are significantly extended and costs of raw materials and shipping are up significantly. The increased use of face masks and other personal protective equipment as a result of the pandemic created additional demand for our antifog product in 2020 and the first half of 2021. The increased demand caused a number of new participants to start selling antifog product that hurt our sales. As mask mandates are ending, we are seeing demand fall off. We continue to see progress in our efforts to place Nano Magic products in big box retail and secured several national big box retail placements. However, these customers are also suffering from supply chain disruptions and their focus on their core business is delaying roll-out of some of our solutions.
Our principal operating segments coincide with the types of products to be sold. The Company’s two reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were (i) the Product segment and (ii) the Contract services segment.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following comparative analysis on results of operations was based primarily on the comparative consolidated financial statements, footnotes and related information for the periods identified below and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this report. The results discussed below are for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Comparison of Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Revenues
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, revenues consisted of the following:
For the year ended December 31, 2021, sales from the Product segment increased by $587,690, or 14%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2020 and in the first half of 2021, sales of anti-fog solutions drove revenue. We continue to work to increase sales of our Nano Magic branded solutions by direct sales to consumers, especially using the internet, and are expanding by placing products with pharmacies, big box stores and other retailer outlets. Revenue opportunities from those solutions is delayed by the logistics and other supply chain issues those customers are facing in their business.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, revenues of our Contract services segment decreased by $307,317 or 45% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This reflects completion of work under government contracts without new contracts to replace them. We have submitted proposals for funding of other projects and expect, in the ordinary course of business, that some of those proposals will be funded and new contracts will replace those that have been concluded.
Cost of revenues
Cost of revenues includes inventory costs, materials and supplies costs, internal labor and related benefits, subcontractor costs, depreciation, overhead and shipping and handling costs incurred including costs related to government and private contracts in our Contract services segment.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, cost of revenues increased by $246,886, or 8%. These consisted of the following:

● For the year ended December 31, 2021, selling and marketing expenses increased by $75,647, or 88%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.

The change from 2020 reflects the increase in the number of employees to support increased product sales and the growth in the marketing and sales function and developing our in-house capabilities.
● For the year ended December 31, 2021, research and development costs decreased by $21,941, or 39%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This is attributable to a shift away from outside consultants as we build our in-house capability.
● For the year ended December 31, 2021, professional fees decreased by $78,748, or 10%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This was due, primarily, to the fees for outside counsel incurred in 2020 to challenge the trading suspension.
● For the year ended December 31, 2021, general and administrative expenses increased by $220,148, or 36%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to an increase in support costs associated with increased personnel and resources.

The change was due primarily to the gain related to the forgiveness of the Payroll Protection Program loans in 2021.

The following table sets forth a summary of changes in our working capital from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2020:
The decrease in current assets reflects reduction in accounts receivable during 2021 due to collection efforts.
