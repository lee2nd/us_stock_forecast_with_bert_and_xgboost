ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this quarterly report. References in the following discussion and throughout this annual report to “we”, “our”, “us”, “12 ReTech Corporation”, “12 ReTech”, “RETC”, “the Company”, and similar terms refer to, 12 ReTech Corporation. Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. 12 ReTech Corporation actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this filing.
Company
ReTech Corporation is primarily a technology company focused on the retail experience, both online and in physical stores, for consumers and smaller merchants.
Our software, both deployed and in development, is designed to allow the smaller merchants to compete effectively with the retail behemoths like Walmart and Amazon, and to attract, retain, and delight consumers both online and in physical stores, without being dependent on Google, Facebook/Instagram, and Amazon.
Our AI Social Shopping platform App, which is currently in development, will allow merchants to connect with consumers directly, and will give merchants tools to protect their brand and lower their marketing costs, which will be focused on results not just “looky-loos”.
For consumers, the App allows them to support their favorite local businesses and find new merchants that may be of interest to them, while earning money through their social communications and posts.
The Company has also acquired retail and wholesale operating companies that will allow us to test our tech on real consumers and demonstrate their success for other merchants while earning revenues for the Company.
As an innovative retail technology company that has been built through acquisitions and ideas, we intend to continue to search for additional synergistic acquisitions that bring incremental revenues and profitability, and access to products that will incentivize both merchants and consumers to quickly adopt our social shopping App.
Principal subsidiaries as December 31, 2021.
The details of the principal subsidiaries of the Company as of December 31, 2021, are set out as follows (additional consolidation may occur in the future):
12 Retail Corporation, a subsidiary of 12 ReTech Corporation, operates its own retail store and manages two main subsidiaries each of which have multiple subsidiaries: 12 Fashion Group, Inc and Bluwire Group, LLC.
12 Fashion Group Inc, A subsidiary of 12 Retail Corporation, has the following subsidiaries;
On February 19, 2019 we acquired Red Wire Group, LLC. (“RWG”) a Utah Limited Liability company pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement whereby the Company exchanged and the members of RWG (the “Members”) Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the Company will acquire (i) 75% of the membership interests of RWG in exchange for 54,000 shares of the Corporation’s Series D-6 Preferred Stock and with a stated value of $5.00 (ii) the remaining 25% of the membership interests of RWG in exchange for 37,500 shares of the Corporation’s Series D-5 Preferred Stock with a stated value of $4.00 per share, RWG operates its own “cut & sew” operation for independent third parties contract to produce cloths operating out of its factory in Salt Lake City, Utah.
As of the end of November 30, 2019, we closed the factory in Utah, while 12 Fashion Group retained the customers by completing the orders in process. We were able to produce the products through 3rd party factories in New York City and Los Angeles for less than it cost us to produce the products in our own factory in Salt Lake City, Utah. On March 6, 2020, the company filed a Chapter 11 Bankruptcy filing in Phoenix Arizona. This filing allowed us to sell the equipment we no longer needed, pay off the secured creditors, and shed all of Red Wire’s debt from our balance sheet. The bankruptcy was discharged on or about September 2020, and all debts were extinguished. During 2021, there has been no change in the bankruptcy proceedings. 12 Fashion Group continues to service those customers acquired as well as obtaining new accounts by marketing under the d/b/a Red Wire Designs.
- One March 14, 2019 we acquired Rune NYC, LLC. (“Rune”) a New York Corporation pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement whereby the Company exchanged with the members of Rune (the “Members”), representing 92.5% of the membership interests, and the members agreed to tender their interests to the Corporation, and the Corporation closed out the tender offer period and the Exchange Agreement became effective. Accordingly, pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, at closing the Company acquired 92.5% of the membership interests of Rune in exchange for 82,588 shares of the Corporation’s Series D-5 Preferred Stock with a stated value of $4.00 per share. Rune’s operations continued uninterrupted in New York City following the closing and retained key employees as the leading part of 12 Fashion Group.
- On November 20, 2019 Social Decay, LLC d/b/a Social Sunday, (“Social”) a New Jersey Limited liability company, was acquired by the Company pursuant to a share exchange agreement whereby the Company exchanged the Company’s 30,000 D-6 Shares for 100% of the total outstanding equity of Social and the member of Social (the “Member”). That Member was retained by the Company, but subsequent to the year end on April 15, 2020, she resigned and as a consequence, forfeited the additional 12,000 D-6 Shares held in escrow as a performance incentive. The D-6 shares have a face value of $5.00 per share, and are convertible into the Company’s common shares. Subsequent to year end in March 2020, Social’s print factory was closed in part due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Social’s products are marketing and manufactured by the staff of 12 Fashion Group.
- Bluwire Group, LLC. On October 1, 2019 the Company acquired the retailer with 11 airport terminal locations and one casino location under an equity exchange agreement. Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company issued to the Sellers 500,000 Series A Preferred Shares in exchange for 51% of the equity in Bluwire Group, LLC and its subsidiaries (“Bluwire”). The Sellers retained 30% of Bluwire and 19% is reserved for 12 months for potential equity investors into Bluwire. Any of that equity not used to raise capital for Bluwire over that period would be divided equally between the Company and the Sellers. No capital was raised for Bluwire, and this 19% was issued to 12 ReTech Corporation.
- Tech, Inc. An Arizona corporation, is a subsidiary of 12 ReTech Corporation, and has a number of subsidiaries (“12Tech”). On December 26, 2019, the Company formed 12Tech to spearhead the Company’s software technology development and to focus more effort on the largest retail market in the world: the United States of America. The Company then closed or consolidated under 12Tech all its other software technology companies and maintains the following three subsidiaries:
- Hong Kong, Ltd., a corporation organized in the special economic region of Hong Kong is a subsidiary of 12 Tech, Inc. On June 27, 2017 the Company acquired 12 Hong Kong, Ltd. in a share exchange transaction. Originally this is the Company that managed all the Company’s proprietary and licensed technology that is utilized and sold by the other subsidiaries. With the formation of 12Tech, that role is now being managed by 12Tech. Today, 12 HK operates as a subsidiary of 12Tech and serves as the marketing and sales hub for Asia, particularly the Chinese market and now services our customers in Japan, formerly managed by 12 Japan Ltd.
- 12 Japan, LTD. Organized in Japan and is a subsidiary of 12 Tech, Inc. After the initial acquisition of 12 Hong Kong, LTD during 2017 and the first half of 2018, the Company made several acquisitions including 12 Japan, LTD. Subsequent to this acquisition, the Company took steps to consolidate the assets and streamline operations that effectively by the end the 3rd quarter 2019, this Company no longer functions as independent subsidiary. In the third quarter of 2019 the Company closed the offices of 12 Japan, and its flagship customer ITOYA and the revenue generated will be serviced and managed by 12 Hong Kong.
- Europe, A.G. 12 Europe A.G. was acquired in 2017, and underperformed. In the third quarter 2019, it was determined by management that the costs of continuing to support the expenses of an independent 12 Europe A.G. were unsupportable. Therefore, the Company reaffirmed its previous master representation agreement between 12 Hong Kong, LTD and Coppola, AG so that the software customers in Europe can continue to be supported and then closed its operations in Europe. On August 20, 2019, the Company had successfully discharged all of its debts associated with 12 Europe A.G., as part of the completion of the 12 Europe A.G. bankruptcy filing except for certain social benefit payments still owed approximately $35K by the Company. Therefore, this subsidiary is no longer in existence.
Business and Operations
12 ReTech Corporation is a Technology company that is creating software that management believes will create new platforms and tools for smaller retailers to compete with major companies like Amazon and Walmart and delight consumers. To better understand the entire retail environment, the Company has acquired operating companies that sell direct to consumers online and in physical stores as well as to other retailers. Management believes, in addition to providing current revenue to the Company, these acquisitions will provide entry to other retailers for the sale and or licensing of our technology solutions.
From an operating perspective, 12 ReTech Corporation is a holding company with three main operating companies that themselves may now and/or in the future own other subsidiaries. They are: 12 Retail Corporation which now operates our casino stores and subsidiaries Bluwire Group, LLC; 12 Fashion Group, Inc, that operates our fashion brands and wholesale manufacturing brands; and 12 Tech Inc that designs and develops our retail software.
The Company has earned money from four different revenue streams (in declining order): Retail Sales, Wholesale and Online sales of Fashion products, Royalty Payments for 3rd party licensing of the Bluwire name, and technology sales.
Effects on us of the Covid-19 Pandemic
The time span starting in 2020 and continuing into 2021 was a unusual period in that at nearly at the same time, the entire world was in the grip of the Covid-19 pandemic, with unprecedented closings of businesses, a virtual cessation of most business and personal travel, and lockdown and stay at home orders. As a Company centered around retail, and which derives the most significant portion of its revenue from retail stores in airports and casinos, we were hit particularly hard. In retail, the 1st quarter of every year is the slowest revenue quarter of any year, and even before that first quarter ended, all of our retail stores were closed due to the pandemic. Only the casino store was able to be re-opened in mid-December 2020 to lackluster sales. Supply chains were interrupted, and it became difficult to re-stock our retail store for the holiday season which also delayed its re-opening to mid-December, after an aborted restart in September. The supply chain problems also delayed the receipt of fabric and other products needed by our Fashion Group as they began to re-emerge from under the pandemic closures. Our fashion group, being based-in NYC, was closed for many months and only reopened in July to produce masks. All of the stores our fashion group sold to were also closed. Our technology division, 12 Tech Inc, was also hard hit. Not only were retailers closed and conserving cash like we were, but it became apparent that consumers would no longer interact with public touchscreens, which was the cornerstone of our technology. In other words, our technology was made obsolete in the blink of an eye.
The Company managed survival during the pandemic by squirreling cash and obtaining PPP and or EIDL loans from the SBA. We attempted to retain all of our key employees utilizing these funds, but by June 2021 most have found other jobs once the PPP money ran out. This presents challenges for our airport stores’ re-openings, as it is a long process to get employees certified (“badged”) to work in airports. This will further slow our re-openings during 2022. We also renegotiated various leases and commitments to make us more streamlined and efficient as we re-open and expand. In Japan, we renegotiated out licensing arrangement with ITOYA whereby they managed more of the day-to-day software for a smaller fee, and we eliminated virtually all of our costs there. We also learned that the App we had developed there was strongly used by Japanese consumers of ITOYA. and we could re-develop it for the U.S. market. This process is well on the way, and management believes will create the next great shopping platform.

Financing and Convertible Debt
During the period June 2017 until July 2021, the Company financed most of its operations, acquisitions, and technology through convertible debt. The issue with convertible debt is the dilution that our shareholders experienced as these debt holders converted their debt to common stock and then sold that common stock into the market.
During 2020 and 2021, the Company raised $956,600 in new convertible debt and the existing debt holders converted their older debt in the amount of $ 943,896 into 9,122,400,274 shares of common stock. At December 31, 2021 the Company owed $1,353,447 in convertible debt, held a default reserve of $1,364,204 and maintained a derivative liability reserve of $6,758,937.
During 2020, the Company received $294,882 in PPP funds from the SBA under the CARES Act (“ACT”) During June 2021, the Company was able to have the SBA forgive $70,200 in accordance with the ACT requirements. During the third quarter of 2021, the Company was able to have the SBA forgive the remaining $224,682, thereby all of the first round PPP funds have been forgiven.
During 2021, the company also received $302,602 in PPP funds. The company also asked for these funds to be forgiven in accordance with CARES ACT, and during the fourth quarter, $302,602 of these loans were forgiven by the SBA.
Also, during 2020 the Company received $325,300 in EIDL Funds from the SBA. These funds carry a 3.75% annual interest, and the Company will begin making aggregate monthly payments of $1,588 over the next 360 months.
YEAR ENDED December 31, 2021 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED December 31, 2020
Amounts reflected in our financial statements are accounted for under common control accounting (see footnotes).
Revenues
During the year ended December 31, 2021 our revenues decreased to $ 660,206 from $721,312 in the prior comparable year. This represents a decrease of $61,106 or 8%, which is primarily the result of the continued global pandemic due to COVID 19 on our Bluwire subsidiary and 12 Fashion Group subsidiary during 2021. The government forced the closure of all our store locations on March 16, 2020, and in 2021, we have not yet been able to re-open the remaining Bluwire subsidiary locations following this closure. When allowed, the company was able to re-open only one of our store locations in December 2020. We hope to open additional store locations in the near future.
Cost of revenues
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 we incurred Cost of Revenues associated with the delivery of our products in the amount of $394,394, as compared to $385,236 for the comparable period in 2020. These expenses are related to costs of delivering goods. In 2021, our Cost of Revenues as a percentage of Revenues was 60% as compared to 53% in the prior comparable period. The slightly higher cost of revenues as a percentage of Revenues in 2021 is mainly the result of increased costs associated with purchases of inventory and production materials due to COVID 19.
General and Administrative
Our general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $1,447,357, a significant decrease of $315,499 or 18% when compared to $1,762,856 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease is a result of impact due to COVID 19 and forced closure of operations during many months.
Professional fees
Our professional fee expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $744,112 an increase of $60,861 or 9% when, compared to $683,251 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our professional fees include expenses related to our external auditors, legal costs, and consultants. In order to preserve our subsidiaries operations, the company conserved on spending from the period of closure on March 16, 2020 until December 31, 2021.
Depreciation and amortization
Our depreciation expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $42,600, a decrease of $396,669 or 90% when compared to $439,269 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our depreciation and amortization expense includes intangibles and leasehold improvements added October 1, 2019 as part of the Bluwire acquisition. However, these assets were fully depreciated by March 2021.
Other Expense
Our Other Expenses decreased by $16,099,158 or 83% to $3,292,641 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $19,391,799 for the year ended December 31, 2020. There are four main components of the increase of the 2021 Other Expense category:
1. A significant decrease in the loss of change in derivative liability to $1,792,072 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $18,860,260 for twelve months ended December 31, 2020, resulting in a decrease of $17,068,188 which is the result of the calculation of derivative liability using Black-Scholes.
2. An increase in other income to $598,809 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $431,937 for twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Other income was primarily the result of the PPP loans being forgiven during 2021.
3. An increase in general default reserve expense of for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $429,048, compared to gain of $491,897 as of December 31, 2020.
4. A significant increase in interest expense of $2,056,847 to $2,528,426 as of December 31, 2021 compared to $471,579 for the ended December 31, 2020.
See these components described in further detail below.
Other Income
An increase in other income to $598,809 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $431,937 for twelve months ended December 31, 2020. During 2020 the Company received $294,882 in PPP funds from the SBA under the CARES Act (“ACT”). By September 30, 2021, the Company was able to have the SBA forgive $294,882 of first round PPP loans from 2021. During 2021, the company also received $302,602 in PPP funds. During the third and fourth quarter of 2021, the $302,602 of the second round PPP loans which were also forgiven by the SBA. This represents the majority of the other income recognized by the company in 2021.
Interest Expense
There was an increase in interest expense of $2,056,847 to $2,528,426 as of December 31, 2021 compared to $471,579 for the period ended December 31, 2020. The increase in interest expenses is primarily related to increase in convertible notes’ convertible preferred stock during the same period, as well as a significant increase in interest expense associated with the additional derivative liability and for the general default reserve.
Change in Derivative Liability
There was a gain as a result of the change of derivative liability of $1,792,072 as of December 31, 2021 compared to gain of $18,860,260 for the period ended December 31, 2020. The reason for the change was because of a change in the calculation method from Lattice model to Black-Scholes model.
General Reserve Expense
The company recognized a general default reserve gain of for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $429,048 compared to a general default expense of $491,897 as of December 31, 2020. On July 25, 2019 the Company was served with a lawsuit from Auctus Fund, LLC (“Auctus”). Since 2019 and thereafter, management calculated a default reserve which represents the additional amount management would have to pay out to all note holders in the event of the default. Management quantified what this amount would be which includes additional premiums, additional accrued interest and default accrued interest in 2019 and 2020 and updated these calculations in 2021. The total reserve quantified by management amounted to $1,364,204 and $2,278,648 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Net Income
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred a net loss of $5,260,898 compared to a net loss of $21,941,099 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decreased loss is primarily the result of the increase in the change in derivative liability.
The Company is expending working capital to further their business plan. This includes the further development, refinement and improvement of their software and its adaptation to various languages and geography. The Company is also expending working capital on the development of new technology which is designed to further enhance the attractiveness of their offerings to their target customer base.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company has met its current capital requirements primarily through the issuance of debt-equity and preferred stock. Management views the working capital that is raised through debt-equity or preferred equity offerings as being equivalent to raising working capital via common equity subscriptions, but with the added bonus of allowing the common equity value to rise through the passage of time and simultaneous achievement of the Company’s business goals. Any conversion of debt into equity could occur at a higher equity valuation than the Company currently has. The Company has reserved the right to repurchase these debt-equity interests and preferred stock at a predetermined premium should management determine that this is in the best interests of shareholders at an appropriate future point in time.
Operating expenses for the Company have been paid from revenue as well as from the issuance of debt-equity and preferred stock subscriptions. At December 31, 2021 the Company had a deficit in working capital (current liabilities in excess of current assets) of $14,794,099. A portion of this working capital deficit has been financed loans from stockholders. As of December 31, 2021, amounts owed to stockholders totalled $386,773. At December 31, 2020, the Company had a deficit in working capital (current liabilities in excess of current assets) of $31,490,395. A portion of this working capital deficit has been financed loans from stockholders. As of December 31, 2020, amounts owed to stockholders totalled $383,753. The decrease in working capital deficit when compared to December 31, 2020 was principally due to a decrease derivative liabilities and offset to a lesser extent, increase in accounts payable.
The Company has financed our cash flow requirements through the issuance of debt-equity and preferred stock. As the Company expands, we may continue to experience net negative cash flows from operations, pending generation of significant revenues. Additionally, we anticipate obtaining additional financing to fund operations through debt-equity and preferred stock offerings to the extent available or to obtain additional financing to the extent necessary to augment our working capital balances.
Management believes that our acquisition strategy will successfully provide significant revenues, potential profits as well as access to traditional bank and asset-based credit lines. In addition, Management believes that existing shareholders, lenders and prospective new investors will provide the additional cash needed to meet our obligations as they become due.

The Agreement provided for payment over 6 months and carries a fee of $4,500. This obligation is not convertible under any terms into Company Stock. After the March 16, 2020 Covid shut down, all payment ceased by verbal mutual agreement. In May 2021, the Company entered into a verbal agreement with Vox to repay $250 per week and all collection efforts are put on hold and forbearance on other receivable holders.

This agreement has been in forbearance since April 2021, and the Company pays $10 per week until the Bluwire store at Newark international airport is re-opened.
In the future, we will need to generate sufficient revenues from operations in order to eliminate or reduce the need to sell additional stock or obtain additional loans. However, there can be no assurance we will be successful in raising the necessary funds to execute our high growth business plan.
As of December 31, 2021, the Cash and Cash Equivalents balance was $12,786 compared to December 31, 2020, the Cash and Cash Equivalents balance was $11,784.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the current liabilities decreased by $16,759,204 when compared to December 31, 2020. The primary reason for the decrease was the decrease in derivative liabilities of $17,039,303 to $6,758,937 offset by increase in accounts payable of $980,012 to $4,167,604 as of December 31, 2021 compared to $23,798,240 in derivative liabilities and $3,187,592 in accounts payable as of December 31, 2020. Due to Covid 19 pandemic, the company tried to preserve operations and obtained extended terms from most of its creditors.
As discussed earlier, it is likely that the Company will need to obtain additional working capital through debt-equity and preferred stock capital raises until the Company can generate sufficiently profitable revenues to sustain the cash burn rate that the Company’s business plan calls for.
Although, our business plan calls for high growth, we anticipate that we may continue to incur operating losses during the next twelve months. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies at our stage, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets. Our roll up acquisition strategy seeks to mitigate some of those risks, but until more acquisitions can be completed, consolidated, and we reap the benefits of consolidation, we cannot accurately include their results in our projection of cash needs.
Risks include, but are not limited to, an evolving and unpredictable business model and the management of growth and the consummation and assimilation of multiple acquisitions. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. To address these risks, we must, among other things, increase our customer base, implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy, respond to competitive developments, and attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so can have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.
Impact of COVID-19
Like most other business in the United States, our businesses have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic.In 2020, our main operating subsidiaries were severely impacted by the US Government’s business shutdowns and stay at home orders related to COVID-19. We derive most of our revenue from our 12 Retail Corporation, which is itself composed of two Operating units: 12 Fashion Group and Bluwire Group, LLC.
In response to the President’s “stay at home” orders, on March 16, 2020, we promptly laid off almost all of our 12 Fashion Group employees and contractors. 12 Fashion Group retained three employee/contractors and focused on producing and selling of washable reusable masks, both wholesale and direct to consumer online. With the continued impact of COVID 19, 12 Fashion Group has not hired any additional employees and is maintaining it revenue channels despite the significant impact on the environment.
Our Bluwire retail stores in Newark airport, Dallas airport, and JFK international airport were temporarily closed on or about March 17, 2020. Our Casino location was temporarily closed on or about March 17, 2020 when the Mohegan Sun Casino itself was closed. We laid off all of our Bluwire employee/contractors except two members of the headquarters staff who continued to source innovative products for our stores when they re-open, some of which will be uniquely desired by consumers due to changing buying habits due to COVID-19. During 2021, the Company has not yet been able to reopen these locations.
The financial effects of these closures are reflected in the Management Discussion and Analysis.
The Cares Act and the Payroll Protection Program SBA Loans (PPP Loans).
The Company has applied for PPP Loans for all of its U.S. operating Companies, and is in the process of analyzing if it would qualify for similar governmental assistance for its reduced operating unit in Japan (12 Japan Ltd). The Company has qualified and received for an aggregate of $294,882 in 2020 and $302,602 in 2021 in PPP loans for its operating companies. On June 4, 2021, $70,200 of the first round of PPP loans was forgiven by the SBA. During the third quarter of 2021, an additional $224,682 of the first and second round PPP loans were also forgiven by the SBA. During the fourth quarter, an additional $302,602 in the PPP loans were also forgiven by the SBA.
These funds were used to re-hire previously laid off personnel where appropriate and hire new personal that management believes better fits the post COVID-19 shut-down environment. The Company hired personnel that helps the operating units generate revenues in a more contactless environment and to create changes to our cutting-edge retail software to help our stores and well as other retailers attract consumers in this new environment.
Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern. Since we have not yet generated significant revenue, we have negative cash flows from operations, and negative working capital we have included a reference to the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in connection with our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our total accumulated deficit at December 31, 2021 was $49,709,916 compared to $$44,475,900 as of December 31, 2020.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that adequate sources of financing will be obtained as required and that our assets will be realized, and liabilities settled in the ordinary course of business. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we may cease operations and not be able to execute on operating plans. Accordingly, these consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We use assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Future events, however, may differ markedly from our current expectations and assumptions. We believe there have been no significant changes in accounting policies during the year ended December 31, 2021. See Note 3 to the consolidated statements in this Annual Report for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies and estimates.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards in order to determine their effects, if any, on its consolidated results of operation, financial position, or cash flows. Based on that review, the Company believes that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on its consolidated financial statements. See Note 3 to the consolidated statements in this Annual Report for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies and estimates.
