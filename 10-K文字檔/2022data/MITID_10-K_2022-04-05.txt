ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with and is qualified in its entirety by and should be read together with our financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this consolidated prospectus. This discussion contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as described under the heading “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.
We are working to open primary care clinics around the US that are in residential centers and leverage the expertise, training, and license of Nurse Practitioners. We are focusing on wellness as a core of the practice. Mitesco’s mission is to increase convenience and access to care, improve the quality of care, and reduce its cost.
We opened our first primary care clinic “The Good Clinic” in Northeast Minneapolis, Minnesota in February 2021, and have added five additional operating clinics as of the date of this filing for a total of six clinics open and operating at December 31, 2021. We announced leases for two new clinics in the greater Denver, Colorado area. These new locations are expected to open in the second quarter of 2022. We plan to open clinics in residential concentrations of population to enhance the convenience, especially timely due to the changes in community travel patterns resulting from the pandemic. Our clinicians use both telehealth (virtual) and in-person visits to treat and coach the clients along their journey to better health and quality of life. Our clinics are led by Nurse Practitioners that use their license, extensive training, expertise, and empathy to help people remain stable or improve their health. We emphasize wellness, beginning with a clients’ co-developed plan that identifies from where a person is starting and constructs a plan for how they can achieve their goals. The practice uses an integrated health approach that includes an assessment of both the individual’s behavioral and physical health and combines this with their activation level and their goals. The clinic offers wellness coaching, behavioral health care, episodic care, dermatologic services, and supplements. We seek to care for the whole person’s needs.
Like the first clinic, we seek to locate clinics convenient to residential centers. In pursuit of this approach, we intend to continue to expand our relationship with Lennar Corporation and other large-scale developers. While we have no formal relationship with these developers other than as a tenant, we believe such relationships give us an advantage in recruiting and retaining clients in close proximity to our locations.
Results of Operations
The following period-to-period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily indicative of results for the current period of any future periods. Further, as a result of any acquisitions of other businesses, and any additional pharmacy acquisitions or other such transactions we may pursue, we may experience large expenditures specific to the transactions that are not incident to our operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
To date, we have not generated sufficient revenue from operations to support our operations. We have financed our operations through the sale of equity securities and short-term borrowings. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.2 million compared to cash of approximately $0.1 million as of December 31, 2020.

Critical Accounting Policies
We believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business, results of operations and financial condition because they involve the use of more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and any changes in the assumptions used in making the accounting estimates that are likely to occur could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and codified in the ASC as Topic 606 (“ASC 606”). The revenue recognition standard in ASC 606 outlines a single comprehensive model for recognizing revenue as performance obligations, defined in a contract with a customer as goods or services transferred to the customer in exchange for consideration, are satisfied. The standard also requires expanded disclosures regarding the Company’s revenue recognition policies and significant judgments employed in the determination of revenue.
The Company applied the modified retrospective approach to all contracts when adopting ASC 606. As a result, at the adoption of ASC 606 what was previously classified as the provision for bad debts in the statement of operations is now reflected as implicit price concessions (as defined in ASC 606) and therefore included as a reduction to net operating revenues in 2018. For changes in credit issues not assessed at the date of service, the Company will prospectively recognize those amounts in other operating expenses on the statement of operations. For periods prior to the adoption of ASC 606, the provision for bad debts has been presented consistent with the previous revenue recognition standards that required it to be presented separately as a component of net operating revenues.
Our revenues generally relate to net patient fees received from various payers and patients themselves under contracts in which our performance obligations are to provide services to the patients. Revenues are recorded during the period our obligations to provide services are satisfied. The contractual relationships with patients, in most cases, also involve a third-party payer (Medicare, Medicaid, managed care health plans and commercial insurance companies, including plans offered through the health insurance exchanges) and the transaction prices for the services provided are dependent upon the terms provided by (Medicare and Medicaid) or negotiated with (managed care health plans and commercial insurance companies) the third-party payers. The payment arrangements with third-party payers for the services we provide to the related patients typically specify payments at amounts less than our standard charges and generally provide for payments based upon predetermined rates for services or discounted fee-for-service rates. Management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals.
Stock-Based Compensation
We recognize compensation costs to employees under FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”). Under FASB ASC 718, companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share-based compensation cost for stock options are estimated at the grant date based on each option’s fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (“BSM”) option-pricing model. Share-based compensation arrangements may include stock options, restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the option grant.
Equity instruments issued to other than employees are recorded pursuant to the guidance contained in ASU 2018-07 (“ASU 2018-07”), Improvements to Non-employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplified the accounting for share-based payments granted to non-employees for goods and services. Under the ASU 2018-07, most of the guidance on such payments to non-employees would be aligned with the requirements for share-based payments granted to employees.
Common Stock Purchase Warrants
The Company accounts for common stock purchase warrants in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (“ASC 815”). As is consistent with its handling of stock compensation and embedded derivative instruments, the Company’s cost for stock warrants is estimated at the grant date based on each warrant’s fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (“BSM”) option-pricing model value method for valuing the impact of the expense associated with these warrants.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740 Income Taxes. Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations. No deferred tax assets or liabilities were recognized as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we must estimate our actual current tax liabilities and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the balance sheet. We must assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance must be established. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period, the impact will be included in income tax expense in the statement of operations.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held-for-sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the consolidated balance sheet, if material.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.

The Series X Preferred Stock has a liquidation value of $25.00 per share and a fair value of $31.73 per share at the issuance date of December 31, 2019. Each share of Series X Preferred Stock has voting rights equivalent to 20,000 shares of common stock.
