Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following management's discussion and analysis ("MD&A") of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this 2021 Annual Report.
OVERVIEW
Kingsway is a Delaware holding company with operating subsidiaries located in the United States. The Company owns or controls subsidiaries primarily in the extended warranty, business services, asset management and real estate industries. Kingsway conducts its business through the following three reportable segments: Extended Warranty, Leased Real Estate and Kingsway Search Xcelerator.
Extended Warranty includes the following subsidiaries of the Company: IWS Acquisition Corporation ("IWS"), Geminus Holding Company, Inc. ("Geminus"), PWI Holdings, Inc. ("PWI"), Professional Warranty Service Corporation ("PWSC") and Trinity Warranty Solutions LLC ("Trinity"). Throughout this 2021 Annual Report, the term "Extended Warranty" is used to refer to this segment.
IWS is a licensed motor vehicle service agreement company and is a provider of after-market vehicle protection services distributed by credit unions in 25 states and the District of Columbia to their members, with customers in all 50 states.
Geminus primarily sells vehicle service agreements to used car buyers across the United States, through its subsidiaries, The Penn Warranty Corporation ("Penn") and Prime Auto Care, Inc. ("Prime"). Penn and Prime distribute these products in 32 and 40 states, respectively, via independent used car dealerships and franchised car dealerships.
PWI markets, sells and administers vehicle service agreements to used car buyers in all fifty states via independent used car and franchise network of approved automobile and motorcycle dealer partners. PWI’s business model is supported by an internal sales and operations team and partners with American Auto Shield in three states with a white label agreement. PWI also has a "white label" agreement with Classic to sell a guaranteed asset protection product ("GAP") in states that Classic is approved in.
PWSC sells home warranty products and provides administration services to homebuilders and homeowners across the United States. PWSC distributes its products and services through an in-house sales team and through insurance brokers and insurance carriers throughout all states except Alaska and Louisiana.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
Impact of COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a notable impact on general economic conditions, including but not limited to the temporary closures of many businesses; "shelter in place" and other governmental regulations; and many businesses continue to operate in a work-from-home mode.
The near-term impacts of COVID-19 are primarily with respect to our Extended Warranty segment. Consumer spending was initially impacted, including a decline in the purchase of new and used vehicles, and many businesses through which we distribute our products remained closed or were open but with capacity constraints. More recently, consumer spending has improved but supply-chain issues have caused a shortage of new automobiles which, in turn, has caused demand for used automobiles to increase. This dynamic has had both positive and negative impacts on the Company’s revenues. With respect to homeowner warranties, we saw an initial reduction in new enrollments in our home warranty programs associated with the impact of COVID-19 on new home sales in the United States.
The Company could experience other potential impacts as a result of COVID-19, including, but not limited to, potential impairment charges to the carrying amounts of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles and long-lived assets, the loss in value of investments, as well as the potential for adverse impacts on the Company's debt covenant financial ratios. The Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to its estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of its assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this 2021 Annual Report. Actual results may differ materially from the Company’s current estimates as the scope of COVID-19 evolves or if the duration of business disruptions is longer than initially anticipated. We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic closely. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our operations or financial results is uncertain. There remain many unknowns and the Company continues to monitor the expected trends and related demand for its services and will continue to adjust its operations accordingly.
NON U.S.-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE
Throughout this 2021 Annual Report, we present our operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful, useful and transparent to anyone using this financial information to evaluate our performance. In addition to the U.S. GAAP presentation of net income (loss), we present segment operating income as a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, which we believe is valuable in managing our business and drawing comparisons to our peers. Below is a definition of our non-U.S. GAAP measure and its relationship to U.S. GAAP.
Segment Operating Income (Loss)
Segment operating income (loss) represents one measure of the pretax profitability of our segments and is derived by subtracting direct segment expenses from direct segment revenues. Revenues and expenses presented in the consolidated statements of operations are not subtotaled by segment; however, this information is available in total and by segment in Note 22, "Segmented Information," to the Consolidated Financial Statements, regarding reportable segment information. The nearest comparable U.S. GAAP measure to total segment operating income is loss from continuing operations before income tax benefit that, in addition to total segment operating income, includes net investment income, net realized gains, (loss) gain on change in fair value of equity investments, gain on change in fair value of limited liability investments, at fair value, net change in unrealized loss on private company investments, other-than-temporary impairment loss, interest expense not allocated to segments, other revenue and expenses not allocated to segments, net, amortization of intangible assets, (loss) gain on change in fair value of debt and gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt not allocated to segments. A reconciliation of total segment operating income to loss from continuing operations before income tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 is presented in Table 1 of the "Results of Continuing Operations" section of MD&A.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND CRITICAL ESTIMATES
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classification of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and their underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in estimates are recorded in the accounting period in which they are determined.
The Company’s most critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations, and that require the Company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company has identified the following as its most critical accounting policies and judgments. Although management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information available when they are made, and therefore, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
Valuation of Fixed Maturities and Equity Investments
Our equity investments, including warrants, are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income (loss). Fair value for our equity investments are determined using quoted market values based on latest bid prices, where active markets exist, or models based on significant market observable inputs, where no active markets exist.
For fixed maturities, we use observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are inactive; or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. We do not have any fixed maturities in our portfolio that require us to use unobservable inputs. The Company engages a third-party vendor who utilizes third-party pricing sources and primarily employs a market approach to determine the fair values of our fixed maturities. The market approach includes primarily obtaining prices from independent third-party pricing services as well as, to a lesser extent, quotes from broker-dealers. Our third-party vendor also monitors market indicators, as well as industry and economic events, to ensure pricing is appropriate. All classes of our fixed maturities are valued using this technique. We have obtained an understanding of our third-party vendor’s valuation methodologies and inputs. Fair values obtained from our third-party vendor are not adjusted by the Company.
Gains and losses realized on the disposition of investments are determined on the first-in first-out basis and credited or charged to the consolidated statements of operations. Premium and discount on investments are amortized using the interest method and charged or credited to net investment income.
Fixed maturities and equity investments are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate risk, credit risk and overall market volatility risk. Accordingly, it is reasonably possible that changes in the fair values of the Company’s investments reported at fair value will occur in the near term and such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements.
Impairment Assessment of Investments
The establishment of an other-than-temporary impairment on an investment requires a number of judgments and estimates.
We perform a quarterly analysis of our investments classified as available-for-sale and our limited liability investments to determine if any declines in market value are other-than-temporary. The analysis for available-for-sale investments includes some or all of the following procedures, as applicable:
•
identifying all unrealized loss positions that have existed for at least six months;
•
identifying other circumstances management believes may affect the recoverability of the unrealized loss positions;
•
obtaining a valuation analysis from third-party investment managers regarding the intrinsic value of these investments based on their knowledge and experience together with market-based valuation techniques;
•
reviewing the trading range of certain investments over the preceding calendar period;
•
assessing if declines in market value are other-than-temporary for debt instruments based on the investment grade credit ratings from third-party rating agencies;
•
assessing if declines in market value are other-than-temporary for any debt instrument with a non-investment grade credit rating based on the continuity of its debt service record;
•
determining the necessary provision for declines in market value that are considered other-than-temporary based on the analyses performed; and
•
assessing the Company's ability and intent to hold these investments at least until any investment impairment is recovered.
The risks and uncertainties inherent in the assessment methodology used to determine declines in market value that are other-than-temporary include, but may not be limited to, the following:
•
the opinions of professional investment managers could be incorrect;
•
the historical trading patterns of individual investments may not reflect future valuation trends;
•
the credit ratings assigned by independent credit rating agencies may be incorrect due to unforeseen or unknown facts related to a company's financial situation; and
•
the debt service pattern of non-investment grade instruments may not reflect future debt service capabilities and may not reflect a company's unknown underlying financial problems.
We perform a quarterly analysis of our investments in private companies. The analysis includes some or all of the following procedures, as applicable:
•
the opinions of external investment and portfolio managers;
•
the financial condition and prospects of the investee;
•
recent operating trends and forecasted performance of the investee;
•
current market conditions in the geographic area or industry in which the investee operates;
•
changes in credit ratings; and
•
changes in the regulatory environment.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
As a result of the analysis performed to determine declines in market value that are other-than-temporary, the Company recorded write downs for other-than-temporary impairment related to certain of its investments. See "Investments" section below and Note 6, "Investments," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Valuation of Limited Liability Investments, at Fair Value
Limited liability investments, at fair value represent the underlying investments of the Company’s consolidated entities Net Lease Investment Grade Portfolio LLC ("Net Lease") and Argo Holdings Fund I, LLC ("Argo Holdings"). The Company accounts for these investments at fair value with changes in fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations.
Net Lease owns investments in limited liability companies that hold investment properties. The fair value of Net Lease's investments is based upon the net asset values of the underlying investments companies as a practical expedient to estimate fair value.
Argo Holdings makes investments in limited liability companies and limited partnerships that hold investments in search funds and private operating companies. The fair value of Argo Holdings' limited liability investments that hold investments in search funds is based on the initial investment in the search funds. The fair value of Argo Holdings' limited liability investments that hold investments in private operating companies is valued using a market approach.
Refer to Note 23, "Fair Value of Financial Instruments," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Valuation of Real Estate Investments
The fair value of real estate investments is subjective and involves a combination of the market and income valuation techniques. Under this approach, a market-based capitalization rate is derived from comparable transactions, adjusted for any unique characteristics of each asset, and applied to the asset under consideration. The cap rates used during underwriting and subsequent valuations incorporate the consideration of risks of vacancy and collection loss, administrative costs of owning net leased assets and possible capital expenditures that could be determined a landlord expense.
Valuation of Deferred Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes is calculated based on the expected tax treatment of transactions recorded in our consolidated financial statements. In determining our provision for income taxes, we interpret tax legislation in a variety of jurisdictions and make assumptions about the expected timing of the reversal of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the valuation of deferred income taxes.
The ultimate realization of the deferred income tax asset balance is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the Company's temporary differences reverse and become deductible. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred income tax asset balance will not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is needed, management considers all available positive and negative evidence affecting specific deferred income tax asset balances, including the Company's historical and anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, and the availability of tax planning strategies.
Objective positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for all or a portion of a company's deferred income tax asset balances when significant negative evidence exists. Cumulative losses are the most compelling form of negative evidence considered by management in this determination. To the extent a valuation allowance is established in a period, an expense must be recorded within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2021, the Company maintains a valuation allowance of $169.7 million, all of which relates to its U.S. deferred income taxes. The largest component of the U.S. deferred income tax asset balance relates to tax loss carryforwards that have arisen as a result of losses generated from the Company's U.S. operations. Uncertainty over the Company's ability to utilize these losses over the short-term has led the Company to record a valuation allowance.
Future events may result in the valuation allowance being adjusted, which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. If sufficient positive evidence were to arise in the future indicating that all or a portion of the deferred income tax assets would meet the more likely than not standard, all or a portion of the valuation allowance would be reversed in the period that such a conclusion was reached.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
Accounting for Business Combinations and Asset Acquisitions
The Company evaluates acquisitions in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations ("ASC 805"), to determine if a transaction represents an acquisition of a business or an acquisition of assets.
An acquisition of a business represents a business combination. The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for a business combination by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill. We determine the fair value of such assets and liabilities, often in consultation with third-party valuation advisors. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant judgment and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue, costs and cash flows, discount rates, royalty rates, and selection of comparable companies. The resulting fair values and useful lives assigned to acquisition-related intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense. Acquired intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period. Acquisition costs related to a business combination are expensed as incurred.
When an acquisition does not meet the definition of a business combination either because: (i) substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset, or group of similar identified assets, or (ii) the acquired entity does not have an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs, the Company accounts for the acquisition as an asset acquisition. In an asset acquisition, goodwill is not recognized. Any excess of the total purchase price plus transaction costs over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated on a relative fair value basis to the identifiable net assets at the acquisition date. The net assets acquired in an asset acquisition of property generally include, but are not limited to: land, building, building and tenant improvements, and intangible assets or liabilities associated with above-market and below-market leases and in-place leases.
The Company's methodology for determining fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities includes estimating an "as-if vacant" fair value of the physical property, which includes land, building, and improvements. In addition, the Company determines the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, considering the following categories: (i) value of in-place leases, and (ii) above and below-market value of in-place leases. The value of in-place leases is estimated based on the value associated with the costs avoided in originating leases compared to the acquired in-place leases as well as the value associated with lost rental and recovery revenue during the assumed lease-up period. The value of in-place leases is amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term and is included in amortization of intangible assets in the consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the above-market or below-market component of an acquired lease is based upon the present value (calculated using a market discount rate) of the difference between the contractual rents to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and management’s estimate of the rents that would be paid using fair market rental rates and rent escalations at the date of acquisition over the remaining term of the lease. An identifiable intangible asset or liability is recorded if there is an above-market or below-market lease at an acquired property. The amounts recorded for above-market leases are included in intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheets, and the amounts for below-market leases are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. These amounts are amortized on a straight-line basis as an adjustment to rental revenue over the remaining term of the applicable leases. Changes to these assumptions could result in a different pattern of recognition. If tenants do not remain in their lease through the expected termor exercise an assumed renewal option, there could be a material impact to earnings.
Valuation and Impairment Assessment of Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets with definite useful lives consist of database, customer relationships, in-place lease and non-compete agreement. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If circumstances require that a definite-lived intangible asset be tested for possible impairment, we first compare the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that definite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the definite-lived intangible asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of a tenant relationship and trade names. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are assessed for impairment annually as of November 30, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the intangible asset is impaired, then a fair value-based impairment test would be required. Management must make estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets that may affect any resulting impairment write-down. This includes assumptions regarding future cash flows and future revenues from the related intangible assets or their reporting units. Management then compares the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets to their respective carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds the fair values of that intangible asset, an impairment is recorded.
No impairment charges were recorded against intangible assets in 2021 or 2020. Additional information regarding our intangible assets is included in Note 9, "Intangible Assets," to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
Goodwill Recoverability
Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of November 30, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units and compares it to the carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to such excess.
For Extended Warranty, the Company estimates the fair value using a valuation technique based on observed market capitalization multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") for a group of publicly traded insurance services and insurance brokerage companies, an approach that the Company views as a technique consistent with the objective of measuring fair value consistent with prior years’ assessments performed.
For Leased Real Estate, the Company models a hypothetical sale of the underlying asset in order to arrive at fair value, which, due to the unique nature of Leased Real Estate, the Company views as a technique consistent with the objective of measuring fair value. The estimated fair value of Leased Real Estate is highly sensitive to discount rates applied and changes in the underlying assumptions in the future could differ materially due to the inherent uncertainty in making such estimates. Additionally, estimates regarding future sales proceeds and timing of such proceeds could also have a significant impact on the fair value. The Company performed a Step 1 impairment assessment for Leased Real Estate at June 30, 2021, due to the sensitivity of interest rates in determining fair value and the impact that the additional borrowing may have on the determination of fair value. The results of this assessment indicated the fair value exceeded carrying value for Leased Real Estate. However, if there were sustained increases in the underlying interest rates used in our analysis then the fair value could be reduced to a level that could indicate impairment.
Estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results, internal forecasts, market observable pricing multiples of similar businesses and comparable transactions and determining the appropriate discount rate and long-term growth rate assumptions. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. It is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods.
Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of the goodwill impairment charge, or both.
No impairment charges were recorded against goodwill in 2021 or 2020, as the estimated fair values of the reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values. Additional information regarding our goodwill is included in Note 8, "Goodwill," to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
Deferred Acquisition Costs
Deferred acquisition costs represent the deferral of expenses that we incur related to successful efforts to acquire new business or renew existing business. Acquisition costs, which are incremental costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and primarily include commissions and expenses incurred directly related to the acquisition of vehicle service agreements, are deferred and amortized over the expected customer relationship period consistent with the pattern in which the related revenues are earned. Management regularly reviews the categories of acquisition costs that are deferred and assesses the recoverability of this asset.
Fair Value Assumptions for Subordinated Debt Obligations
Our subordinated debt is measured and reported at fair value. The fair value of the subordinated debt is calculated using a model based on significant market observable inputs and inputs developed by a third-party. These inputs include credit spread assumptions developed by a third-party and market observable swap rates. The following summarizes the impacts:
The other primary variable affecting the fair value of debt calculation is the passage of time, which will always have the effect of increasing the fair value of debt.
Therefore, changes in the underlying interest rates used would cause the fair value to be impacted. However, such impact only impacts the income statement (or comprehensive income/loss for the portion related to credit risk) and does not impact cash flows.
Fair Value Assumptions for Subsidiary Stock-Based Compensation Awards
Two of the Company's subsidiaries, PWSC and Ravix, have made grants of restricted stock awards or restricted unit awards (together "Subsidiary Restricted Awards"). The Subsidiary Restricted Awards are measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period during which awards are expected to vest, with a corresponding increase to either additional paid-in capital for equity-classified awards or to a liability for liability-classified awards. Certain of the Subsidiary Restricted Awards are classified as a liability, either because they contain a noncontingent put option that is exercisable less than six months after the vesting of certain shares or because the awards are expected to settle in cash. Liability-classified awards, included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, are measured and reported at fair value on the date of grant and are remeasured each reporting period. The Subsidiary Restricted Awards contain performance conditions that are reviewed quarterly to assess the probability of achievement of the performance condition. Compensation expense is adjusted when a change in the assessment of achievement of the specific performance condition is determined to be probable. Forfeitures are recognized in the period that Subsidiary Restricted Awards are forfeited.
The determination of fair value of the Subsidiary Restricted Awards is subjective and involves significant estimates and assumptions of whether the awards will achieve performance thresholds. The fair value of the Subsidiary Restricted Awards is estimated using either an internal valuation model without relevant observable market inputs or the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The significant inputs used in the internal valuation model includes a valuation multiple applied to trailing twelve month earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. The determination of the grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is affected by subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the awards, expected volatility over the expected term of the awards, expected dividend yield, and risk-free interest rates. The assumptions used in the Company’s Black-Scholes option-pricing model require significant judgment and represent management’s best estimates.
Contingent Consideration
The consideration for certain of the Company's acquisitions include future payments to the former owners that are contingent upon the achievement of certain targets over future reporting periods. Liabilities for contingent consideration are measured and reported at fair value at the date of acquisition with subsequent changes in fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations as other (expense) income.
Determining the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities requires management to make assumptions and judgments. The fair value of Company’s contingent consideration liability is estimated by applying the Monte Carlo simulation method to forecast achievement of gross profit. These fair value measurements are based on significant inputs not observable in the market. Key inputs in the valuation include forecasted gross profit, gross profit volatility, discount rate and discount term. Management must use judgment in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Changes in assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration benefit or expense reported in the consolidated statements of operations and have an impact on the payout of contingent consideration liabilities. Contingent consideration liabilities are revalued each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or multiple inputs, including adjustments to the key inputs or changes in the assumed achievement or timing of any targets. Any changes in fair value are reported in the consolidated statements of operations as other (expense) income. Additional information regarding our contingent consideration liabilities is included in Note 23, "Fair Value of Financial Instruments," to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition
Service fee and commission revenue represents vehicle service agreement fees, guaranteed asset protection products ("GAP") commissions, maintenance support service fees, warranty product commissions, homebuilder warranty service fees, homebuilder warranty commissions and business services consulting revenue based on terms of various agreements with credit unions, consumers, businesses and homebuilders. Customers either pay in full at the inception of a warranty contract, commission product sale or when consulting services are billed, or on terms subject to the Company’s customary credit reviews.
The Company’s revenue recognition policy follows guidance from ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which utilizes a five-step revenue recognition framework. The Company identifies the contract with its customers and then identifies the performance obligations in the contracts. The transaction price is determined based on the amount we expect to be entitled to in exchange for providing the promised services to the customer. The transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied.
Certain of the Company’s contracts with customers include obligations to provide multiple services to a customer. Determining whether services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately from one another requires judgment. Revenue from GAP commissions and homebuilder warranty service fees contain multiple distinct performance obligations that are accounted for separately.
Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price ("SASP") for each distinct performance obligation. Revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative SASP. SASP are not directly observable in the GAP and homebuilder warranty contracts for the separate performance obligations. As a result, the Company has applied the expected cost plus a margin approach to develop models to estimate the standalone selling price for each of its performance obligations in order to allocate the transaction price to the two separate performance obligations identified. In these models, the Company makes judgments about which of its actual costs are associated with each of the performance obligations. The relative percentage of expected costs plus a margin associated with these performance obligations is applied to the transaction price to determine the estimated SASP of the performance obligations, which the Company recognizes as earned as services are performed over the term of the contract period.
In certain jurisdictions the Company is required to refund to a customer a pro-rata share of the vehicle service agreement fees if a customer cancels the agreement prior to the end of the term. Depending on the jurisdiction, the Company may be entitled to deduct from the refund a cancellation fee and/or amounts for claims incurred prior to cancellation. While refunds vary depending on the term and type of product offered, historically refunds have averaged 9% to 13% of the original amount of the vehicle service agreement fee. Revenues recorded by the Company are net of variable consideration related to refunds and the associated refund liability is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The Company estimates refunds based on the actual historical refund rates by warranty type taking into consideration current observable refund trends in estimating the expected amount of future customer refunds to be paid at each reporting period.
Refer to Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our revenue recognition accounting policies.

RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS
A reconciliation of total segment operating income to net income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 is presented in Table 1 below:
Table 1 Segment Operating Income for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020
For the years ended December 31 (in thousands of dollars)
Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations and Net Income (Loss)
During the third quarter of 2021, the Company completed its fair value analysis of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in its acquisition of PWI, which resulted in PWI recording a $3.6 million reduction to deferred service fees that will be amortized over time. As a result, PWI recorded a $1.9 million non-cash, current period cumulative reduction to service fee and commission revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2021. Of this amount, $1.4 million relates to the period from acquisition through June 30, 2021 and $0.4 million relates to the period from July 1, 2021 through September 30, 2021.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we reported income from continuing operations of $1.9 million compared to a loss from continuing operations of $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is primarily attributable to the items explained in the following paragraphs. Net income (loss) was the same as income (loss) from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 and was materially the same for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Extended Warranty
The Extended Warranty service fee and commission revenue increased 57.4% (or $27.3 million) to $74.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared with $47.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The 2021 service fee and commission revenue of $74.9 million includes a $1.9 million non-cash, cumulative reduction to service fee and commission revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2021 relating to the decrease in PWI acquired deferred service fees as a result of finalizing the purchase accounting. Service fee and commission revenue was impacted by the following in 2021:
•
A $25.8 million increase due to the inclusion of PWI in 2021 following its acquisition effective December 1, 2020, which includes a $1.9 million non-cash, cumulative reduction to service fee and commission revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2021 relating to the decrease in PWI acquired deferred service fees as a result of finalizing the purchase accounting. However, the continued COVID-19 pandemic has caused supply-chain issues in the automotive industry, resulting in significant increases in the prices of used automobiles (PWI’s primary market), making it difficult for smaller automobile dealers to obtain inventory and, therefore, putting downward pressure on PWI’s revenue;
•
A $2.1 million increase at Trinity driven by increased revenues ($1.4 million) in its equipment breakdown and maintenance support services primarily due to the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on 2020 revenues; and increased sales ($0.7 million) of extended warranty services product as a result of marketing efforts;
•
A $0.6 million increase at PWSC, driven by a strong housing market;
•
A $0.4 million increase at IWS. While IWS’ market is also impacted by similar macro-economic conditions brought on by the continued COVID-19 pandemic as explained above for PWI, IWS has more product diversity in that it also sells a substantial amount of VSAs for new automobiles but, more importantly, its products are distributed through credit unions at the point of vehicle financing, which has been less impacted by the recent macro-economic conditions; and
•
A $1.6 million decrease at Geminus, which is being impacted by similar macro-economic conditions brought on by the continued COVID-19 pandemic as explained above for PWI.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
The Extended Warranty operating income was $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared with $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in operating income is primarily due to the following:
•
Inclusion of Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") loan forgiveness related to Extended Warranty companies of $2.2 million for 2021, compared with $0.4 million for 2020;
•
A $1.1 million increase due to the inclusion of PWI in 2021 following its acquisition effective December 1, 2020. Current year results include a $1.9 million non-cash, cumulative reduction to service fee and commission revenue relating to the decrease in PWI acquired deferred service fees as a result of finalizing the purchase accounting during 2021;
•
A $1.8 million increase at IWS primarily due to the increase in revenue explained above, as well as a decrease in claims authorized on vehicle service agreements (fewer claims in 2021 partially offset by higher cost per claim) and lower general and administrative expenses as the company continues to contain costs at pre-COVID levels;
•
A $0.4 million increase at PWSC, primarily due to increased revenue and holding operating costs in-check;
•
A $0.1 million increase at Geminus due to a decrease in claims authorized on vehicle service agreements (fewer claims in 2021) and lower general and administrative expenses as the company continues to contain costs at pre-COVID levels, both of which were essentially offset by a decrease in revenue; and
•
A $0.8 million increase at Trinity driven by increased revenues, partially offset by a related increase in cost of services sold (primarily for equipment breakdown and maintenance support services), compared to 2020.
Leased Real Estate
Leased Real Estate rental revenue was $13.4 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The rental revenue is derived from CMC's long-term triple net lease.
Leased Real Estate operating income was $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to operating loss of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Leased Real Estate operating income (loss) includes interest expense of $6.2 million and $6.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
The operating income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was impacted by:
•
A $2.9 million expense recorded during the second quarter of 2021 to write-off an indemnification receivable (which is exactly offset by a tax benefit of $2.9 million in net income);
•
Management expense of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of the March settlement agreement; and
•
A $0.6 million benefit recorded in 2021 related to the finalization of management fees and legal expenses associated with the settlement of CMC litigation.
The operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was impacted by a $2.6 million management fee expense recorded pursuant to the CMC litigation settlement and $1.3 million of litigation expenses.
See Note 25, "Commitments and Contingent Liabilities," to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further information on the CMC litigation settlement.
Kingsway Search Xcelerator
The Kingsway Search Xcelerator revenue was$3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and is derived from the Company's subsidiary, Ravix, that was acquired on October 1, 2021. Kingsway Search Xcelerator operating income was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Net Investment Income
Net investment income was $1.6 million in 2021 compared to $2.6 million in 2020. The decrease in 2021 is primarily due to lower investment income from:
•
Limited liability investments, at fair value. This consists of Argo Holdings and Net Lease. Argo Holdings is not expected to generate a substantial portion of investment income annually. The Net Lease decrease is due to (1) the sale of two underlying properties over the past year and (2) interest income no longer being reported separately by Net Lease due to a change associated with the sale of the two properties; and
•
Fixed maturities held within investments by Extended Warranty. The decrease is a result of general changes in market conditions.
Net Realized Gains
The Company recorded net realized gains of $1.8 million in 2021 compared to $0.6 million in 2020. The net realized gains for 2021 primarily relate to:
•
The sale of two limited liability investments during the fourth quarter of 2021;
•
Realized gains recognized by Argo Holdings; and
•
Distributions received from one of the Company’s investments in private companies in which its carrying value previously had been written down to zero as a result of prior distributions.
The net realized gains for 2020 primarily relate to realized gains recognized by Argo Holdings.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
(Loss) Gain on Change in Fair Value of Equity Investments
Loss on change in fair value of equity investments was $0.2 million in 2021 compared to a gain of $1.3 million in 2020. Significant drivers include:
•
Unrealized losses of $0.3 million and $0.2 million on equity investments held during the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively; and
•
Net realized gains of less than $0.1 million and $1.5 million on equity investments sold during the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The net realized gains for the year ended December 31, 2020 relate primarily to the sale of the Company's shares of Limbach Holdings, Inc. ("Limbach") common stock. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company sold all of its shares of Limbach common stock for cash proceeds totaling $3.2 million.
Gain on Change in Fair Value of Limited Liability Investments, at Fair Value
Gain on change in fair value of limited liability investments, at fair value was $2.4 million in 2021 compared to $4.0 million in 2020. The gain for the year ended December 31, 2021 represents increases in fair value of $1.6 million related to Net Lease, due to net cash proceeds received in excess of the carrying value from the sale of one of the properties and a resulting reduction in debt at one of the underlying LLC's, as well as an increase in fair value of $0.8 million related to Argo Holdings.
The gain for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes an increase in fair value of $4.9 million related to Net Lease, due to the sale of one of the Net Lease investment properties, partially offset by a decrease in fair value of $0.8 million related to Argo Holdings.
Net Change in Unrealized Loss on Private Company Investments
Net change in unrealized loss on private company investments was zero in 2021 compared to $0.7 million in 2020. For 2021 and 2020, the Company did not record any adjustments to the fair value of its investments in private companies for observable price changes. As part of the Company's quarterly impairment analysis of its investments in private companies, the Company determined it should write down two of its investments for other-than-temporary impairment of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of the impacts of COVID-19 on the investments' underlying business.
Interest Expense not Allocated to Segments
Interest expense not allocated to segments for 2021 was $6.2 million compared to $7.7 million in 2020. The decrease in 2021 is primarily attributable to:
•
$0.2 million lower interest expense related to the Company's bank loan used to acquire PWI in December 2020. As part of that transaction, the Company borrowed a principal amount of $25.7 million from a bank to partially finance the acquisition of PWI and to fully repay the prior outstanding loan at KWH (which had an original loan amount of $10.0 million). The new loan has an annual interest rate equal to LIBOR, having a floor of 0.75%, plus 3.00% (current rate of 3.75%), while the previous loan had an annual interest rate equal to LIBOR, having a floor of 2.00%, plus 9.25% (rate prior to payoff of 11.25%);
•
$0.5 million lower interest expense on the Company’s subordinated debt, which resulted from generally lower London interbank offered interest rates for three-month U.S. dollar deposits ("LIBOR") during 2021 compared to 2020. The Company's subordinated debt bears interest at the rate of LIBOR, plus spreads ranging from 3.85% to 4.20%; and
•
An increase of $0.1 million that partially offset the above decreases, related to a new $6.0 million bank loan as part of the acquisition of Ravix on October 1, 2021, that has an annual interest rate equal to LIBOR, having a floor of 0.75%, plus 3.00% (current rate of 3.75%).
See "Debt" section below for further details.
Other Revenue and Expenses not Allocated to Segments, Net
Other revenue and expenses not allocated to segments was a net expense of $11.4 million in 2021 compared to $10.6 million in 2020.
The increase in net expense for 2021 is primarily attributable higher expense related to restricted stock awards due to new grants to officers of the Company, as well as an increase in fair value of previously-granted awards to a subsidiary President that are accounted for on a fair value basis. This increase was partially offset by:
•
$1.3 million in expense recorded in 2020 to settle outstanding litigation between the Company and Aegis Security Insurance Company ("Aegis");
•
A decrease in audit professional services fees incurred during 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, as the Company is now current in its required financial filings; and
•
Continued cost reduction initiatives with respect to the holding company’s ongoing expense base.
See Note 25, "Commitments and Contingent Liabilities," to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion related to Aegis.
Amortization of Intangible Assets
Amortization of intangible assets was $4.9 million in 2021 compared to $2.3 million in 2020. The higher amortization expense for 2021 is related to amortization of intangible assets recorded in conjunction with the Company's acquisitions of PWI effective December 1, 2020 and Ravix effective October 1, 2021. During 2021, the Company finalized its fair value analysis of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in its acquisition of PWI, which resulted in the Company recording $2.6 million of amortization expense during 2021 related to the intangible assets identified. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company completed a preliminary evaluation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in its acquisition of Ravix, which resulted in the Company recording $0.4 million of amortization expense during 2021 related to the intangible assets identified.
See Note 4, "Acquisitions," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Company’s acquisition of PWI.

(Loss) Gain on Change in Fair Value of Debt
The loss on change in fair value of debt amounted to $3.2 million in 2021 compared to a gain on change in fair value of debt of $1.2 million in 2020. The loss for 2021 reflects an increase in the fair value of the subordinated debt resulting primarily from changes in interest rates used (not related to instrument-specific credit risk). The following summarizes the impacts:

Gain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt not Allocated to Segments
During 2021, gain on extinguishment of debt not allocated to segments consists of a $0.3 million gain (recorded in the first quarter) on forgiveness of the balance of the holding company's loan obtained through the PPP of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ("CARES") Act.
During 2020, loss on extinguishment of debt not allocated to segments consists of a $0.9 million loss on the extinguishment of the 2019 KWH Loan, which includes the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and discount of $0.6 million and early termination fees paid to the lender of $0.2 million.
See Note 12, "Debt," to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion.
Income Tax Benefit
Income tax benefit for 2021 was $7.6 million compared to $1.1 million in 2020. The 2021 and 2020 income tax benefit is primarily related to:
•
An income tax benefit of $1.9 million and $1.3 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, for the partial release of the Company’s deferred income tax valuation allowance associated with business interest expense with an indefinite life;
•
An income tax expense of $0.5 million in 2021 and an income tax benefit of $0.5 million in 2020 attributable to the Company’s deferred income tax valuation allowance related to its acquisition of CMC;
•
An income tax benefit of $4.1 million in 2021 for the partial release of the Company’s deferred income tax valuation allowance related to its acquisitions of PWI and Ravix;
•
An income tax benefit of $2.8 million in 2021 and an income tax expense of $0.2 million in 2020 relating to a change in unrecognized tax benefits;
•
An income tax expense of $0.2 million and $0.2 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, relating to a change in indefinite life deferred income tax liabilities; and
•
An income tax expense of $0.5 million and 0.3 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, for state income taxes.
See Note 15, "Income Taxes," to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional detail of the income tax benefit recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
INVESTMENTS
PWI, which was acquired by the Company in December 2020, began investing a substantial portion of its restricted cash during 2021. Previously, PWI had not held a substantial amount of investments.
Portfolio Composition
The following is an overview of how we account for our various investments:
•
Investments in fixed maturities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value.
•
Equity investments are reported at fair value.
•
Limited liability investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The most recently available financial statements of the limited liability investments are used in applying the equity method. The difference between the end of the reporting period of the limited liability investments and that of the Company is no more than three months.
•
Limited liability investments, at fair value represent the underlying investments of the Company’s consolidated entities Net Lease and Argo Holdings. The difference between the end of the reporting period of the limited liability investments, at fair value and that of the Company is no more than three months.
•
Investments in private companies consist of: convertible preferred stocks and notes in privately owned companies; and investments in limited liability companies in which the Company’s interests are deemed minor. These investments do not have readily determinable fair values and, therefore, are reported at cost, adjusted for observable price changes and impairments.
•
Real estate investments are reported at fair value.
•
Other investments include collateral loans and are reported at their unpaid principal balance.
•
Short-term investments, which consist of investments with original maturities between three months and one year, are reported at cost, which approximates fair value.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
At December 31, 2021, we held cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments with a carrying value of $98.3 million.
Investments held by our insurance subsidiary, Kingsway Amigo Insurance Company ("Amigo"), must comply with domiciliary state regulations that prescribe the type, quality and concentration of investments. Our U.S. operations typically invest in U.S. dollar-denominated instruments to mitigate their exposure to currency rate fluctuations.
Table 2 below summarizes the carrying value of investments, including cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, at the dates indicated.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairment
The Company performs a quarterly analysis of its investments to determine if declines in market value are other-than-temporary. Further information regarding our detailed analysis and factors considered in establishing an other-than-temporary impairment on an investment is discussed within the "Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Estimates" section of MD&A.
As a result of the analysis performed, the Company recorded the following write downs for other-than-temporary impairment:
•
Other investments: zero and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
•
Limited liability investments, at fair value: $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, which are included in gain on change in fair value of limited liability investments, at fair value in the consolidated statements of operations.
•
Investments in private companies: zero and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, which are included in net change in unrealized loss on private company investments in the consolidated statements of operations.
There were no write-downs recorded for other-than-temporary impairments related to available-for sale investments or limited liability investments for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.
KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.
Management's Discussion and Analysis
The length of time a fixed maturity investment may be held in an unrealized loss position may vary based on the opinion of the investment manager and their respective analyses related to valuation and to the various credit risks that may prevent us from recapturing the principal investment. In the case of a fixed maturity investment where the investment manager determines that there is little or no risk of default prior to the maturity of a holding, we would elect to hold the investment in an unrealized loss position until the price recovers or the investment matures. In situations where facts emerge that might increase the risk associated with recapture of principal, the Company may elect to sell a fixed maturity investment at a loss.
At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities amounted to $0.3 million and less than $0.1 million, and there were no unrealized losses attributable to non-investment grade fixed maturities. At each of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, all unrealized losses on individual investments were considered temporary.
Impact of COVID-19 on Investments
The Company continues to assess the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the value of its various investments, which could result in future material decreases in the underlying investment values. Such decreases may be considered temporary or could be deemed to be other-than-temporary, and management may be required to record write-downs of the related investments in future reporting periods.
DEBT
See Note 12, "Debt," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details to those provided below.
Bank Loans
On October 12, 2017, the Company borrowed a principal amount of $5.0 million from a bank to partially finance its acquisition of PWSC (the "PWSC Loan"). The PWSC Loan was scheduled to mature on October 12, 2022; however, the principal was fully repaid on January 30, 2020.
In 2019, the Company formed Kingsway Warranty Holdings LLC ("KWH"), whose subsidiaries at the time included IWS, Geminus and Trinity. On March 1, 2019, KWH borrowed a principal amount of $10.0 million from a bank to finance its acquisition of Geminus (the "2019 KWH Loan"). The 2019 KWH Loan had an annual interest rate equal to LIBOR, having a floor of 2.00%, plus 9.25%. The 2019 KWH Loan was scheduled to mature on March 1, 2024; however, the principal was fully repaid on December 1, 2020.
As part of the acquisition of PWI on December 1, 2020, PWI became a wholly owned subsidiary of KWH, which borrowed a principal amount of $25.7 million from a bank to finance its acquisition of PWI and to fully repay the 2019 KWH Loan (the "2020 KWH Loan"). The 2020 KWH Loan has an annual interest rate equal to LIBOR, having a floor of 0.75%, plus 3.00% (current rate of 3.75%) and is carried in the consolidated balance sheets at its amortized cost, which reflects the quarterly pay-down of principal as well as the amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs using the effective interest rate method. The 2020 KWH Loan matures on December 1, 2025.
The 2020 KWH Loan contains a number of covenants, including, but not limited to, a leverage ratio, a fixed charge ratio and limits on annual capital expenditures, all of which are as defined in and calculated pursuant to the 2020 KWH Loan that, among other things, restrict KWH’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, make dividends and distributions, engage in mergers, acquisitions and consolidations, make certain payments and investments and dispose of certain assets.
As part of the acquisition of Ravix on October 1, 2021, Ravix became a wholly owned subsidiary of Ravix Acquisition LLC ("Ravix LLC"), and together they borrowed from a bank a principal amount of $6.0 million in the form of a term loan, and established a $1.0 million revolver to finance the acquisition of Ravix (together, the "Ravix Loan").

Notes Payable
As part of its acquisition of CMC in July 2016, the Company assumed the Mortgage and recorded the Mortgage at its estimated fair value of $191.7 million, which included the unpaid principal amount of $180.0 million as of the date of acquisition plus a premium of $11.7 million. The Mortgage matures on May 15, 2034 and has a fixed interest rate of 4.07%. The Mortgage is carried in the consolidated balance sheets at its amortized cost, which reflects the monthly pay-down of principal as well as the amortization of the premium using the effective interest rate method.
On June 2, 2021, TRT Leaseco ("TRT"), a subsidiary of CMC, entered into an amendment to the Mortgage to borrow an additional $15.0 million, which is recorded as note payable in the consolidated balance sheets ("the Additional Mortgage"). The net proceeds from the Additional Mortgage were used to advance increased rental payments to the parties that had entered into a legal settlement agreement reached during the first quarter of 2021, including the Company, which received $2.7 million. The Additional Mortgage matures on May 15, 2034 and has a fixed interest rate of 3.20%. The Additional Mortgage is carried in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021 at its amortized cost, which reflects the monthly pay-down of principal as well as the amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs using the effective interest rate method. See Note 25(a), "Commitments and Contingent Liabilities - Legal proceedings," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the CMC litigation settlement agreement.
As part of its acquisition of RoeCo on December 30, 2021, the Company assumed the LA Mortgage, which is comprised of a senior amortizing note, a senior interest only note and a junior note. The Company recorded the LA Mortgage at its aggregate unpaid principal amount of $13.5 million as of the date of acquisition plus a premium of $3.5 million. The senior amortizing note matures on September 14, 2036 and has a fixed interest rate of 3.75%. The senior interest only note matures on October 14, 2036 and has a fixed interest rate of 5.682%. The junior note matures on September 16, 2036 and has a fixed interest rate of 7.0%, of which a fixed amount is payable semi-annually and the remainder is added to the principal balance of the junior note. The LA Mortgage is carried in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021 at its aggregate unpaid principal balance.
On January 5, 2015, Flower Portfolio 001, LLC assumed a $9.2 million mortgage in conjunction with the purchase of investment real estate properties ("the Flower Note"). The Flower Note matures on December 10, 2031 and has a fixed interest rate of 4.81%. The Flower Note is carried in the consolidated balance sheets at its unpaid principal balance.
On October 15, 2015, Net Lease Investment assumed a $9.0 million mezzanine debt in conjunction with the purchase of investment real estate properties ("the Net Lease Note"). The Net Lease Note matured on November 1, 2020 and had a fixed interest rate of 10.25%. The Net Lease Note is carried in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020 at its unpaid principal balance. In conjunction with the maturity of the Net Lease Note on November 1, 2020, Net Lease explored alternatives to maximize the value of its investment portfolio. As a result of this process, Net Lease elected to sell one of its three investment real estate properties while refinancing the remaining properties and the existing financing was repaid. Each of these transactions closed on October 30, 2020, however because the Company reports Net Lease on a three-month lag, the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020 continues to report the $9.0 million mezzanine debt.
In April 2020, certain subsidiaries of the Company received loan proceeds under the PPP, totaling $2.9 million with a stated annual interest rate of 1.00%. The PPP, established as part of the CARES Act and administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the "SBA"), provides for loans to qualifying businesses for amounts up to 2.5 times of the average monthly payroll costs (as defined for purposes of the PPP) of the qualifying business. The loans and accrued interest are forgivable as long as the borrower uses the loan proceeds for eligible purposes, including payroll, costs, rent and utilities, during the twenty-four week period following the borrower’s receipt of the loan and maintains its payroll levels and employee headcount. The amount of loan forgiveness will be reduced if the borrower reduces its employee headcount below its average employee headcount during a benchmark period or significantly reduces salaries for certain employees during the covered period.
The Company used the entire loan amount for qualifying expenses. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced that it will conduct audits for PPP loans that exceed $2.0 million. If we were to be audited and receive an adverse outcome in such an audit, we could be required to return the full amount of the PPP Loan and may potentially be subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties.
On December 21, 2020 the SBA approved the forgiveness of the full amount of one of the five PPP loans, which included principal and interest of $0.4 million. In January 2021 and March 2021, the SBA provided the Company with notices of forgiveness of the full amount of the remaining four loans. The forgiveness in the first quarter of 2021 included total principal and interest of $2.5 million. The carrying value of the PPP at December 31, 2020 represents its unpaid principal balance.
Subordinated Debt
Between December 4, 2002 and December 16, 2003, six subsidiary trusts of the Company issued $90.5 million of 30-year capital securities to third parties in separate private transactions. In each instance, a corresponding floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debenture was then issued by Kingsway America Inc. to the trust in exchange for the proceeds from the private sale. The floating rate debentures bear interest at the rate of LIBOR, plus spreads ranging from 3.85% to 4.20%. The Company has the right to call each of these securities at par value any time after five years from their issuance until their maturity.
During the third quarter of 2018, the Company gave notice to its Trust Preferred trustees of its intention to exercise its voluntary right to defer interest payments for up to 20 quarters, pursuant to the contractual terms of its outstanding Trust Preferred indentures, which permit interest deferral. This action does not constitute a default under the Company's Trust Preferred indentures or any of its other debt indentures. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, deferred interest payable of $18.7 million and $14.1 million, respectively, is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
The agreements governing our subordinated debt contain a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict the Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, make dividends and distributions, and make certain payments in respect of the Company’s outstanding securities.
The Company's subordinated debt is measured and reported at fair value. At December 31, 2021, the carrying value of the subordinated debt is $61.0 million. The fair value of the subordinated debt is calculated using a model based on significant market observable inputs and inputs developed by a third-party. For a description of the market observable inputs and inputs developed by a third-party used in determining fair value of debt, see Note 23, "Fair Value of Financial Instruments," to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the market observable swap rates changed, and the Company experienced a decrease in the credit spread assumption developed by the third-party. Changes in the market observable swap rates affect the fair value model in different ways. An increase in the LIBOR swap rates has the effect of increasing the fair value of the Company's subordinated debt while an increase in the risk-free swap rates has the effect of decreasing the fair value. The increase in the credit spread assumption has the effect of decreasing the fair value of the Company's subordinated debt while a decrease in the credit spread assumption has the effect of increasing the fair value. The other primary variable affecting the fair value of debt calculation is the passage of time, which will always have the effect of increasing the fair value of debt. The changes to the credit spread and swap rate variables during 2021, along with the passage of time, contributed to the $10.0 million increase in fair value of the Company’s subordinated debt between December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021.
Of the $10.0 million increase in fair value of the Company’s subordinated debt between December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, $6.8 million is reported as an increase in fair value of debt attributable to instrument-specific credit risk in the Company's consolidated statements of comprehensive loss and $3.2 million is reported as loss on change in fair value of debt in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.
Though changes in the market observable swap rates will continue to introduce some volatility each quarter to the Company’s reported gain or loss on change in fair value of debt, changes in the credit spread assumption developed by the third party does not introduce volatility to the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the Company’s subordinated debt will eventually equal the principal value, totaling $90.5 million, of the subordinated debt by the time of the stated redemption date of each trust, beginning with the trust maturing on December 4, 2032 and continuing through January 8, 2034, the redemption date of the last of the Company’s outstanding trusts.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The purpose of liquidity management is to ensure there is sufficient cash to meet all financial commitments and obligations as they fall due. The liquidity requirements of the Company and its subsidiaries have historically been met primarily by funds generated from operations, capital raising, disposal of discontinued operations, investment maturities investment income, other returns received on investments and from the sale of investments.
A significant portion of the cash provided by our Extended Warranty companies is required to be placed into restricted trust accounts, as determined by the insurers who back-up our service contracts, in order to fund future expected claims. On a periodic basis (quarterly or annually), we may be required to contribute more into the restricted accounts or we may be permitted to draw additional funds from the restricted accounts, dependent upon actuarial analyses performed by the insurers regarding sufficiency of funds to cover future expected claims. A substantial portion of the restricted trust accounts are invested in fixed maturities and other instruments that have durations similar to the expected future claim projections.
Cash provided from these sources is used primarily for warranty expenses, business service expenses, debt servicing, acquisitions and operating expenses of the holding company.
The Company's Extended Warranty and Kingsway Search Xcelerator subsidiaries fund their obligations primarily through service fee and commission revenue. The Company's Leased Real Estate subsidiaries fund their obligations through rental revenue.
Cash Flows
During 2021, the Company reported $5.9 million of net cash used in operating activities, primarily due to:
•
A $10.6 million cash outflow related to prepaid management fees recorded during the second quarter of 2021. The $10.6 million was only paid because of the gross proceeds received under the Additional Mortgage (shown as a cash inflow from financing activities), of which the Company retained $2.7 million;
•
A $3.1 million change in other assets and liabilities, net, which is primarily due to a decrease in income taxes payable; and
•
Cash inflows generated by the Extended Warranty segment (which includes PWI for twelve months in 2021) and cost containment initiatives at the holding company.
To clarify, the gross proceeds received under the Additional Mortgage and associated cash outflows (to the Company and a third party) had essentially no impact on the Company’s overall net cash flows. However, the outflow to the third party is a reduction to operating cash flows while the gross proceeds are shown as a cash inflow from financing activities, as required by U.S. GAAP.
During 2021, the net cash used in investing activities was $8.6 million. This use of cash was primarily attributed to:
•
Purchases of fixed maturities in excess of proceeds from sales and maturities of fixed maturities of $15.6 million;
•
The acquisitions of Ravix and RoeCo in 2021, which totaled $12.2 million, net of cash acquired;
•
Distributions received (reducing the use of cash) by Net Lease from two of its limited liability investment companies of $16.3 million; and
•
Proceeds received (reducing the use of cash) from the Company's limited liability investments.
During 2021, the net cash provided by used in financing activities was $0.5 million, primarily attributed to:
•
Principal repayments: on bank loans of $4.9 million, notes payable of $14.0 million, of which $9.0 million relates to the repayment of Net Lease's $9.0 million mezzanine loan and $5.0 million relating to principal paydowns on the Mortgage, Additional Mortgage and the Flower Note;
•
Distributions to noncontrolling interest holders of $2.4 million; and
•
Net proceeds (reducing the use of cash) from notes payable of $13.3 million related to the Additional Mortgage, net proceeds from bank loans of $6.2 million related to the Ravix Loan and proceeds from the exercise of warrants of $1.8 million.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
Holding Company Liquidity
The liquidity of the holding company is managed separately from its subsidiaries. The obligations of the holding company primarily consist of holding company operating expenses; transaction-related expenses; investments; and any other extraordinary demands on the holding company.
Actions available to the holding company to increase liquidity in order to meet its obligations include the sale of passive investments; sale of subsidiaries; issuance of debt or equity securities; exercise of warrants; distributions from the Company’s Extended Warranty and Kingsway Search Xcelerator subsidiaries, as further described below; and giving notice to its Trust Preferred trustees of its intention to exercise its voluntary right to defer interest payments for up to 20 quarters on the six subsidiary trusts of the Company’s subordinated debt, which right the Company exercised during the third quarter of 2018.
Receipt of dividends from the Company's insurance subsidiaries is currently not considered a source of liquidity for the holding company. The insurance subsidiaries have required regulatory approval for the return of capital and, in certain circumstances, prior to the payment of dividends. At December 31, 2021, Amigo was restricted from making any dividend payments to the holding company without regulatory approval pursuant to domiciliary state insurance regulations.
On December 1, 2020, the Company closed on the acquisition of PWI, a full-service provider of vehicle service agreements. Related to the PWI acquisition, the Company secured the 2020 KWH Loan with IWS, Trinity, Geminus and PWI (the "KWH Subs") as borrowers under the 2020 KWH Loan. Pursuant to satisfying the covenants under the 2020 KWH Loan, the KWH Subs were permitted to make distributions to the holding company in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1.5 million in any 12-month period (which is the same amount as under the predecessor loan).
Beginning in 2022, the Company is permitted to receive a portion of the excess cash flow (as defined in the 2020 KWH Loan document) generated by the KWH Subs in the previous year. Based on current covenants, the Company would be entitled to 50% of the excess cash flow with the other 50% used to pay down the 2020 KWH Loan. The Company is currently finalizing the excess cash flow calculation for the year ended December 31, 2021, but is expected to receive between $1.0 and $1.5 million (with an equivalent amount expected to pay down the KWH 2020 Loan).
The amount of excess cash flow the Company is entitled to retain is dependent upon the leverage ratio (as defined in the 2020 KWH Loan document):
Separately, pursuant to covenants under the PWSC Loan secured to partially finance the acquisition of PWSC on October 12, 2017, PWSC was not permitted to make distributions to the holding company without the consent of the lender. The PWSC Loan was scheduled to mature on October 12, 2022; however, the remaining principal totaling $0.3 million was fully repaid on January 30, 2020 and, as such, PWSC is no longer subject to such restrictions.
On October 1, 2021, the Company closed on the acquisition of Ravix. Related to the PWI acquisition, the Company secured the Ravix Loan with Ravix and Ravix LLC as borrowers under the Ravix Loan. Pursuant to the covenants under the Ravix Loan, Ravix is permitted to make distributions to the holding company so long as doing such would not cause non-compliance with the various covenants outlined within the Ravix Loan.
Historically, dividends from the Leased Real Estate segment were not generally considered a source of liquidity for the holding company. However, as more fully described in Note 25, "Commitments and Contingent Liabilities," to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the holding company is now permitted to receive 20% of the proceeds from the increased rental payments resulting from an earlier amendment to the CMC lease (or any borrowings against such increased rental payments). In the second quarter of 2021, the holding company received a dividend of $2.7 million from the net proceeds from the Additional Mortgage. Refer to Note 12, "Debt," to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further information about this borrowing. In conjunction with the Additional Mortgage, TRT paid a guarantee fee of $1.1 million to a third-party during the second quarter of 2021, who is serving as a guarantor or indemnitor with respect to certain obligations between TRT and the holder of the Additional Mortgage. Refer to Note 25, "Commitments and Contingent Liabilities," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this off-balance sheet guarantee.
On October 18, 2018, the Company completed the previously announced sale of its non-standard automobile insurance companies Mendota Insurance Company, Mendakota Insurance Company and Mendakota Casualty Company (collectively "Mendota"). As part of the transaction, the Company will indemnify the buyer for any loss and loss adjustment expenses with respect to open claims in excess of Mendota's carried unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses at June 30, 2018 related to the open claims. The maximum obligation to the Company with respect to the open claims is $2.5 million. Per the purchase agreement, a security interest on the Company’s equity interest in its consolidated subsidiary, Net Lease, as well as any distributions to the Company from Net Lease, was to be collateral for the Company’s payment of obligations with respect to the open claims. During the third quarter of 2021, the purchasers of Mendota and the Company agreed to release the Company's equity interest in Net Lease as collateral and allow Net Lease to make distributions to the Company. In exchange, the Company agreed to deposit $2.0 million into an escrow account and advance $0.5 million to the purchaser of Mendota to satisfy the Company's payment obligation with respect to the open claims. Refer to Note 25, "Commitments and Contingent Liabilities," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this off-balance sheet guarantee.
The holding company’s liquidity, defined as the amount of cash in the bank accounts of Kingsway Financial Services Inc. and Kingsway America Inc., was $2.2 million (approximately five months of recurring operating cash outflows) and $1.1 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, which excludes future actions available to the holding company that could be taken to generate liquidity. The holding company cash amounts are reflected in the cash and cash equivalents of $12.6 million and $14.4 million reported at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
The holding company’s liquidity at December 31, 2021 represents only actual cash on hand and does not include cash that would be made available to the holding company from the sale of investments owned by the holding company. In addition, the holding company has access to some of the operating cash generated by the Extended Warranty and Kingsway Search Xcelerator subsidiaries as described above. While these sources do not represent cash of the holding company, they do represent future sources of liquidity.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
As of December 31, 2021, there are 169,733 shares of the Company’s Class A Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Shares"), issued and outstanding. The outstanding Preferred Shares were required to be redeemed by the Company on April 1, 2021 ("Redemption Date") if the Company had sufficient legally available funds to do so. Additionally, the Company has exercised its right to defer payment of interest on its outstanding subordinated debt ("trust preferred securities") and, because of the deferral which totaled $18.7 million at December 31, 2021, the Company is prohibited from redeeming any shares of its capital stock while payment of interest on the trust preferred securities is being deferred. If the Company was required to pay either the Preferred Shares redemption value or both the deferred interest on the trust preferred securities and redeem all the Preferred Shares currently outstanding, then the Company has determined that it does not have sufficient legally available funds to do so. However, the Company is prohibited from doing so under Delaware law and, as such, (a) the interest on the trust preferred securities remains on deferral as permitted under the indentures and (b) in accordance with Delaware law the Preferred Shares were not redeemed on the Redemption Date and instead remain outstanding with a redemption value of $6.5 million as of December 31, 2021, continue to be convertible at the discretion of the holder, and will accrue dividends until such time as the Company has sufficient legally available funds to redeem the Preferred Shares and is not otherwise prohibited from doing so. The Company continues to operate in the ordinary course.
The Company notes there are several variables to consider in such a situation, and management continues to explore the following opportunities: negotiating with the holders of the Preferred Shares with respect to the key provisions, raising additional funds through capital market transactions, as well as the Company’s strategy of working to monetize its non-core investments while attempting to maximize the tradeoff between liquidity and value received.
Based on the Company’s current business plan and revenue prospects, existing cash, cash equivalents, investment balances and anticipated cash flows from operations are expected to be sufficient to meet the Company’s working capital and operating expenditure requirements, excluding the cash that may be required to redeem the Preferred Shares and deferred interest on its trust preferred securities, for the next twelve months. However, the Company’s assessment could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Regulatory Capital
In the United States, a risk-based capital ("RBC") formula is used by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") to identify property and casualty insurance companies that may not be adequately capitalized. In general, insurers reporting surplus as regards policyholders below 200% of the authorized control level, as defined by the NAIC, at December 31 are subject to varying levels of regulatory action, including discontinuation of operations. As of December 31, 2021, surplus as regards policyholders reported by Amigo exceeded the 200% threshold.
During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company began taking steps to place all of Amigo into voluntary run-off. As of December 31, 2012, Amigo’s RBC was 157%. In April 2013, Kingsway filed a comprehensive run-off plan with the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, which outlines plans for Amigo's run-off. Amigo remains in compliance with that plan. As of December 31, 2021, Amigo's RBC was 8,417%.
Kingsway Reinsurance Corporation ("Kingsway Re"), our reinsurance subsidiary domiciled in Barbados, is required by the regulator in Barbados to maintain minimum statutory capital of $125,000. Kingsway Re is currently operating with statutory capital near the regulatory minimum, requiring us to periodically contribute capital to fund operating expenses. Kingsway Re incurs operating expenses of approximately $0.1 million per year. As of December 31, 2021, the capital maintained by Kingsway Re was in excess of the regulatory capital requirements in Barbados.
New York Stock Exchange Listing Standards
On April 17, 2020, the Company received notification from the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") of the Company's noncompliance with certain NYSE standards for continued listing of its common shares. Specifically, Kingsway was below the NYSE's continued listing criteria because its average total market capitalization over a 30 consecutive trading day period was less than $50.0 million at the same time that reported shareholders' equity was below $50.0 million. Under the NYSE's continued listing criteria, a NYSE-listed company must maintain average market capitalization of not less than $50.0 million over a 30 consecutive trading day period or reported shareholders' equity of not less than $50.0 million.
In accordance with the NYSE listing requirements, the Company submitted a business plan to the NYSE on June 1, 2020 that demonstrated how we expected to return to compliance with NYSE listing standard. On July 9, 2020, the NYSE notified the Company that the plan was accepted.
KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.
Management's Discussion and Analysis
On January 18, 2021, the Company received notification from the NYSE that the Company is again in compliance with NYSE's continued listing standards, but that the Company was subject to continued monitoring and review for a period of 12 months. The Company remained in compliance during this 12-month period.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
Table 3 summarizes cash disbursements related to the Company's contractual obligations projected by period, including debt maturities, interest payments on outstanding debt and future minimum payments under operating leases. Interest payments on outstanding debt in Table 3 related to the subordinated debt, the 2020 KWH Loan and the Ravix Loan assume LIBOR remains constant throughout the projection period. Also, interest payments on outstanding debt reflect the interest deferral described in the "Subordinated Debt" section above.
TABLE 3 Cash payments related to contractual obligations projected by period
As of December 31, 2021 (in thousands of dollars)
Table 3 above does not reflect amounts that may be paid for the redemption of the 169,733 shares of Preferred Shares outstanding at December 31, 2021. Each Preferred Share is convertible into 6.25 common shares at a conversion price of $4.00 per common share any time at the option of the holder prior to the Redemption Date. On and after February 3, 2016, the Company may redeem all or any part of the then outstanding Preferred Shares for the price of $28.75 per Preferred Share, plus accrued but unpaid dividends thereon, whether or not declared, up to and including the Redemption Date. The total redemption amount of the Preferred Shares if the Preferred Shares are not converted is $6.5 million as of December 31, 2021. As discussed in the "Cash Flows" section above, in accordance with Delaware law, the Preferred Shares were not redeemed on the Redemption Date and instead remain outstanding, continue to be convertible at the discretion of the holder, and will accrue dividends until such time as the Company has sufficient legally available funds to redeem the Preferred Shares and is not otherwise prohibited from doing so. The timing and amount of cash, if any, to be paid by the Company will be based upon the extent, if at all, that the Company exercises its right to redeem any Preferred Shares prior to the Redemption Date or the holders of the Preferred Shares exercise their option to convert any of the Preferred Shares to common shares.
Refer to Note 19, "Redeemable Class A Preferred Stock," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Preferred Shares.
