Overview
Concrete Leveling Services, Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) was incorporated on August 28, 2007 in the State of Nevada. The Company's principal offices are located at 5046 East Boulevard Northwest, Canton, Ohio 44718. In Ohio, the Company does business under the trade name of CLS Fabricating, Inc. On March 24, 2017, we entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement, whereby we will acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Jericho Associates, Inc. (“Jericho”), a company operating in the gaming, hospitality and entertainment industries, in exchange for 7,151,416 shares of our common stock which were contingently issued to the shareholders of Jericho. In July 2017, an additional 481,000 shares were issued to shareholders of Jericho under the same contingencies as the original shares. The Equity Purchase Agreement provided that by September 24, 2017, if the management of Jericho does not identify at least one entity or business opportunity for acquisition, in order to supplement the Company’s current business operations, the shares issued as part of the agreement shall be returned to the Company and the transaction will be nullified. On September 22, 2017, the Company and Jericho mutually agreed to extend the performance requirement until December 24, 2017. On November 9, 2017, the Company and Jericho mutually agreed to extend the performance requirement until March 1, 2018.
On February 25, 2018, Jericho identified the acquisition of 50% interests in two LLCs (the “LLCs”). The LLCs have a Term Sheet agreement to develop a casino and hotel resort, and provide certain gaming equipment on a shared profit basis. The contemplated over $300 million project, is in the process of regulatory review, finalization of closing documents, and completion of financing. Notwithstanding the identification of the business opportunity the shares issued to Jericho remain contingent upon the regulatory review, the finalization of closing documentation, and the completion of financing arrangements for the project.
Also, upon the regulatory review, the finalization of closing documentation, and the completion of financing arrangements for the project, the Company’s President will cancel all shares of common stock held (879,167 shares as of July 31, 2019), the Company’s Chief Executive Officer will cancel all but 550,000 shares of her common stock held (2,951,667 shares as of July 31, 2019), and the Company’s Secretary will cancel all but 45,000 shares of common stock held (185,000 shares as of July 31, 2019).
We have never declared bankruptcy, have never been in receivership, and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings.
If the transaction with Jericho finalizes, the Company will operate two business divisions, which will be operated simultaneously and consist of the following:
The concrete leveling division of the business will fabricate and market a concrete leveling service unit utilized in the concrete leveling industry. This unit secures to the back of a truck and consists of a mixing device to mix lime with water and a pumping device capable of pumping the mixture under pressure into pre-drilled holes in order to raise the level of any flat concrete surface.
The gaming and hospitality division of the business will focus on casino gaming, hospitality, entertainment and leisure time industries, and will pursue opportunities in the tribal and commercial casino gaming industries, both in California and Nevada. The Company will also operate in the casino gaming technology industry, and is seeking opportunities to partner, joint venture, or acquire companies developing casino games that combine traditional casino games with the challenge of video games and the playability of social games, meaning games that pit the player’s skill against the skill of another player as opposed to the casino itself.
Results of Operations
For the Year Ended July 31, 2022 Compared to the Year Ended July 31, 2021
The Company generated $1,082 in revenue for the year ended July 31, 2022, which compares to revenue of $3,105 for the year ended July 31, 2021. Our revenues decreased during the year ended July 31, 2022 due to decreased sales of our concrete leveling parts due to a decrease in demand.
Cost of sales for the year ended July 31, 2022 was $397, which compares to cost of sales of $1,582 for the year ended July 31, 2021. Our revenues decreased during the year ended July 31, 2022, which resulted in a similar decrease in our cost of sales during the period. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased during the year ended July 31, 2022 due to a change in product mix.
Operating expenses, which consisted of legal and professional fees and selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended July 31, 2022, were $39,763. This compares with operating expenses for the year ended July 31, 2021 of $41,185. Our operating expenses decreased during the year ended July 31, 2022 due to a decrease in our legal and professional fees.
As a result of the foregoing, we had a net loss of $48,967 for the year ended July 31, 2022. This compares with a net loss of $45,815 for the year ended July 31, 2021.
In its audited financial statements as of July 31, 2022, the Company was issued an opinion by its auditors that raised substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern based on the Company's current financial position. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to successfully develop and market our products and our ability to generate revenues.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of July 31, 2022, we had cash or cash equivalents of $747. As of July 31, 2021, we had cash or cash equivalents of $815.
We believe that with our existing cash flows, we do not have sufficient cash to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months. We believe that with the addition of our gaming and hospitality business, we will begin to generate increased revenue over the 2023 fiscal year. However, if our revenue is not sufficient to allow us to meet our cash requirements during the next twelve months, the Company may need to raise additional funds through the sale of debt or equity securities. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating sufficient revenues or other funds in the future to cover these operating costs. Failure to generate sufficient revenues or additional financing when needed could cause us to go out of business.
Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended July 31, 2022 was $39,684. This compares to net cash used in operating activities of $40,577 for the year ended July 31, 2021. This change is primarily due to an increase in accrued interest during the year ended July 31, 2022.
Cash flows provided by financing activities were $39,616 for the year ended July 31, 2022 which compares to cash flows provided by financing activities of $40,343 for the year ended July 31, 2021. The change in cash flows provided by financing activities is due to a decrease in advances from stockholders during the year ended July 31, 2022. We anticipate significant increases in cash flows provided by financing activities during the next 12 months, as we intend to raise capital through either debt or equity securities to fund our business.
As of July 31, 2022, our total assets were $25,738 and our total liabilities were $466,282. As of July 31, 2021, our total assets were $26,173 and our total liabilities were $417,750.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We believe that the following critical policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements.
We disclose those accounting policies that we consider to be significant in determining the amounts to be utilized for communicating our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the first note to our financial statements included elsewhere herein. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results are likely to differ from these estimates, but management does not believe such differences will materially affect our financial position or results of operations.
We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical because they have the greatest impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Going Concern
The Company was formed on August 28, 2007 and was in the development stage through July 31, 2009. The year ended July 31, 2010 was the first year during which it was considered an operating company. The Company has sustained substantial operating losses since its inception. In addition, the Company has used substantial amounts of working capital in its operations. Further, at July 31, 2022, our liabilities exceed our assets by $440,544.
Success will be dependent upon management’s ability to obtain future financing and liquidity, and success of its future operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
Foreign Currency Transactions
None.
