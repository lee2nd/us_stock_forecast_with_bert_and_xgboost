Overview

Results of Operations
The following table sets forth the summary statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. For information on the year ended December 31, 2019, refer to Part II, Item 7 of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Sales
Our sales increased by 43.6% to $72.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $50.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Sales increased in 2021 due to an increase in sale of entitled land of $20.6 million, developed lot sales of $14.3 million, and fee build income of $6.8 million from Lennar, which were partially offset by a decrease in home sales of $19.6 million.
Gross Profit
Our overall gross profit margin was 30.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 4.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the gross margin on land sales was 43.3% and 0%, respectively. Gross margin on developed lot sales for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, was 40.8% and (5.7)%, respectively. Gross margin for homes closed was 14.1% and 5.7%, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the gross margin for fee build was 11.9% and 0%, respectively.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses increased by 103.0% to $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in total operating expenses is primarily attributable to the following:
1)Payroll and related benefits increased by $1.7 million due to increase in staff from the continued investment in our public company infrastructure and personnel to support our future growth plan;
2)Insurance costs increased by $1.1 million, primarily driven by the purchase of director’s and officer’s insurance;
3)Professional fees and investor relations costs increased by $0.5 million, and $0.4 million, respectively, primarily driven by establishing and maintaining public company infrastructure and oversight;
4)Additional depreciation expense of $0.5 million related to equipment additions;
5)Stock compensation costs increased by $0.4 million, primarily driven by stock options and restricted stock issued to directors, executives, and employees; and
6)Additional right of use expense of $0.3 million from leasing an office space in Tacoma, Washington for new headquarters.
Other Expense
Other expense increased by 2.2% to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, $0.01 million of our PPP loan was forgiven as compared to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We incurred $0.2 million of interest expense related to our fixed assets financing arrangements as compared to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, we recorded $0.04 million of loss on sales of equipment for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, other income increased mainly due to timber sales of $0.1 million as compared to $0.004 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Net Income (Loss)
Our net income (loss) increased by 335.4% to $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to a loss of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue and improved gross margins in 2021 as explained above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
Our principal uses of capital were operating expenses, land purchases, land development, home construction, the payment of routine liabilities, and common stock repurchases. We used funds generated by operations, capital raises, and available borrowings to meet our short-term working capital requirements. We remain focused on generating increasingly positive margins in land acquisitions and development operations and home construction operations in order to maintain a strong balance sheet and keep us poised for growth.
We employ both debt and equity as part of our ongoing financing strategy to provide us with the financial flexibility to access capital on the best terms available. In that regard, we employ prudent leverage levels to finance the acquisition and development of our lots and construction of our homes, townhomes, condominiums, and apartments. Our existing indebtedness is recourse to us and we anticipate that future indebtedness will likewise be recourse.
Our management considers a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of new indebtedness, including the purchase price of assets to be acquired with debt financing, the estimated market value of our assets, and the ability of particular assets, and our Company as a whole, to generate cash flow to cover the expected debt service. Our governing documents do not contain a limitation on the amount of debt we may incur and our board of directors may change our target debt levels at any time without the approval of our shareholders.
We intend to finance future acquisitions and developments with the most advantageous source of capital available to us at the time of the transaction, which may include a combination of common and preferred equity, secured and unsecured corporate level debt, property level debt and mortgage financing, and other public, private, or bank debt.
Secured Revolving Credit Facility - On March 7, 2022, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility with BankUnited for $25.0 million. The unpaid principal bears interest at a fluctuating rate of interest per annum equal to the daily simple secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) plus the applicable margin of 4.75%.
Real Estate Assets
Our real estate assets have increased to $122.1 million as of December 31, 2021 from $20.4 million as of December 31, 2020. This increase was due to an increase in the number of houses, condominiums, and apartments under construction, and the purchase of additional developed and undeveloped lots.
Liabilities
Liabilities increased to $70.0 million as of December 31, 2021 from $27.2 million as of December 31, 2020. This increase is primarily attributable to the following:
1.An increase in construction loans of $25.4 million due to purchases of real estate;
2.An increase in related party construction loans of $7.6 million due to purchases of real estate; and
3.An increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $8.0 million primarily due to the increase of real estate projects in process and income tax payable.
Cash & Restricted Cash Balance
As of December 31, 2021, our cash balance was $26.2 million compared to $2.4 million as of December 31, 2020.
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $86.4 million as compared to net cash provided of $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in operating cash flows is primarily due to the acquisition and development of real estate assets of $98.5 million in 2021 and partially offset by net income of $8.9 million and change in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $8.0 million in 2021.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $0.7 million as compared to net cash provided of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, $0.7 million was used for the acquisition of new property and equipment and there were proceeds from the sale of equipment of $0.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, $0.4 million was used for the acquisition of new property and equipment and there were proceeds from the sale of equipment of $1.0 million.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $110.9 million as compared to net cash used of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, there was net proceeds from common stock issuances of $25.1 million, net proceeds from the preferred stock issuances of $66.6 million, net proceeds from construction loans of $29.3 million, and net proceeds from related party construction loans of $8.0 million. These net proceeds were primarily offset by cash outflows for financing fees from construction loans of $5.6 million, repurchase of common stock of $5.0 million, repayment of equipment loans of $1.9 million, financing fees from related party construction loans of $2.0 million, and preferred stock dividend payments of $2.1 million. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2020, there were net proceeds from a common stock offering of $10.8 million, which were primarily offset by cash outflows to net repayment on related party construction loans of $8 million, financing fees from related party construction loans of $1.4 million, repayment on equipment loans of $1.4 million, and financing fees from construction loans of $1.0 million.
Cash Resources
Although the expected revenue growth and control of expenses leads management to believe that it is probable that our cash resources will be sufficient to meet cash requirements through the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, we may require additional funding to finance the growth of our current and expected future operations as well as to achieve our strategic objectives. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or terms acceptable to us, if at all. In that event, we would be required to change our growth strategy and seek funding on that basis, though there is no guarantee we will be able to do so.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also known as “special purpose entities” (SPEs).
Inflation
Our home building operations can be adversely impacted by inflation, primarily from higher land, financing, labor, material, and construction costs. In addition, inflation can lead to higher mortgage rates which can significantly affect the affordability of mortgage financing to homebuyers. While we attempt to pass on cost increases to customers through increased prices, when weak housing market conditions exist, we may be unable to offset cost increases with higher selling prices. Please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further details on industry and economic risks.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments, and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including
information regarding contingencies, risk, and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.
Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements.
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies.” These provisions include:
•a requirement to present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in a public offering registration statement;
•an exemption to provide less than five years of selected financial data in a public offering registration statement;
•an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“SOX”) in the assessment of the emerging growth company’s internal control over financial reporting;
•an exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies; and
•an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit partner rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer.
We have elected to adopt the reduced disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies. As a result of this election, the information that we provide in this Annual Report may be different than the information you may receive from other public companies in which you hold equity interests.
We will cease to be an “emerging growth company” upon the earliest of: (i) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (ii) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are $1.07 billion or more, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities or (iv) as of the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year.
