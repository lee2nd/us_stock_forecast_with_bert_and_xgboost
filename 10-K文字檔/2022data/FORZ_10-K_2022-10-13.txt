ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and the related notes and the other financial information included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly those under "Risk Factors.” Dollars in tabular format are presented in thousands, except per share data, or otherwise indicated.
Overview
We were incorporated on December 9, 2014 in the state of Florida. On February 17, 2021, we filed Articles of Continuance with the Secretary of State for the state of Wyoming. Accordingly, we transferred our state of formation from Florida to Wyoming and became a Wyoming entity and are now subject to the provisions of the Wyoming Business Corporation Act.
We are in the health-tech wearable performance business. We have acquired the ownership and rights to certain late developmental stage products, including the WarmUp product line which is comprised of the J4 Sport, J4 X and J4 Fitbelt. These products are wearable back compression devices, used to relax, warmup, loosen, or relax stiff & sore muscles. The therapeutic application of heat causes a change in temperature of the soft tissues which decreases joint stiffness and relieves inflammation.
We have recently successfully completed our first acquisition of “Sustainable Origins” which is an eco-friendly ESG company, that converts used cooking oil to reusable biodiesel. This acquisition is part of our ongoing strategic plan for future revenue and expansion. While our primary focus will always be revolving around the innovation of wearable technology, these projects will take time to market. We want to align ourselves with like-minded Entrepreneurs that will mesh well with our team and collective interest. Having the ability to acquire companies current operations to generate steady revenue streams, will also help aid in financing the production of “WarmUp” and other products we will develop.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Note 2 to the Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, contingencies and taxes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Financial Statements.
We are subject to various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when management concludes that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted.
We recognize deferred tax assets (future tax benefits) and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the expected future tax return consequences of those differences, which are expected to be either deductible or taxable when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Future tax benefits have been fully offset by a 100% valuation allowance as management is unable to determine that it is more likely than not that this deferred tax asset will be realized.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
