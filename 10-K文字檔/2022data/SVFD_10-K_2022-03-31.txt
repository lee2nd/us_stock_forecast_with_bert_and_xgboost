item 7. management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. See “Forward-looking Statements” for a discussion of the uncertainties and assumptions associated with these statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below.
Overview
We develop eco-friendly “green” solutions for the food industry. Our solutions are developed to improve the food safety and shelf life of fresh produce. We do this by controlling human and plant pathogens, thereby reducing spoilage, and in turn, reducing food loss.
Our products are based on a proprietary blend of food acids which have a synergistic effect when combined with certain types of oxidizing agent-based sanitizers and fungicides at low concentrations. Our green products are capable of cleaning, sanitizing and controlling pathogens on fresh produce with the goal of making them safer for human consumption and extending their shelf life by reducing their decay. One of the main advantages of our products is that our active ingredients do not leave any toxicological residues on the fresh produce we treat. In contrary, by forming a temporary protective shield around the fresh produce we treat, our products make it difficult for pathogens to develop and potentially provide protection which also reduces cross-contamination.

Results of Operations
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, together with the changes in those items in dollars:
Revenues
Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $438,141, an increase of $205,867, or 89%, compared to total revenues of $232,274 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is mainly a result of the Company’s sales of its new products, which the Company commenced in the fourth quarter of 2020.
We do not have backlogs or firm commitments from our customers for our products. Our sales might deteriorate if we fail to achieve commercial success or obtain regulatory approval of any of our products.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales consists primarily of salaries, materials, transportation and overhead costs of manufacturing our products. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $135,943, an increase of $92,538, or 213%, compared to total cost of revenues of $43,405 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is mainly a result of our increase in sales of our products, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2020 as well as increase in salary and related expenses.
Gross Profit
Gross loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $302,198, an increase of $113,329, or 60%, compared to gross loss of $188,869 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is mainly a result of the increase in revenues as a result of the commencement of our commercial sales, as detailed above as well as increase in salary and related expenses.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, share base compensation, consulting fees, service providers’ costs, related materials and overhead expenses. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $538,684, an increase of $121,684, or 29%, compared to total research and development expenses of $417,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is mainly attributable to an increase in salary and related expenses and professional fees, offset by a decrease in share based compensation expenses.
Selling and Marketing Expenses
Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for selling and marketing personnel, travel related expenses and services providers. Selling and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $200,299, an increase of $149,194, or 292%, compared to total selling and marketing expenses of $51,105 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is mainly attributable to the increase in salaries and related costs, service providers’ commissions and delivery costs associated with our sales.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses including share based compensation and other non-personnel related expenses such as legal expenses and directors and insurance costs. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $4,266,854, an increase of $3,196,745, or 299%, compared to total general and administrative expenses of $1,070,109 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is mainly a result of the increase in professional services, insurance costs and compensation payable to directors as a result of the listing of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market, which occurred during the second quarter of 2021, offset partially by a decrease in expenses associated with share-based compensation to our employees and service providers.
Financing Expenses, Net
Financing expenses, net for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $161,737, a decrease of $108,656, or 40%, compared to total financing expenses of $270,393 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in financing expenses is mainly a result of decrease in Interest and amortization expenses and fair value of our convertible loans related to convertible notes.
Total Comprehensive Loss
As a result of the foregoing, our total comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $4,820,580, compared to $1,593,139 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $3,227,441, or 203%.
Impact of COVID-19
The global spread of COVID-19 led many countries, including the United States, Europe and Israel (where we maintain material operations), to impose stringent limitations on movement, gatherings, transit of passengers and goods and to close the borders between countries. The responses of governments have notably impacted many economies as well as capital markets worldwide.
Based on guidelines provided by the Israeli Government, employers (including us) are required to prepare and increase as much as possible the capacity and arrangement for employees to work remotely. In that regard, and in compliance with all applicable Israeli rules and guidelines, our offices have were closed from the middle of March 2020 until September 2021, and during that period certain of our employees worked remotely and other employees were placed on temporary leave without pay (furlough). However, we did experience any material impact on our financial condition and results of operations due to COVID-19, and we do not expect to experience any material impact on our overall liquidity positions and outlook as a result of the outbreak. Nevertheless, it is not possible at this time to estimate the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic, the continued spread of COVID-19, and any additional measures taken by governments, health officials or by us in response to such spread, could have on our business results of operations and financial condition.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We describe our significant accounting policies more fully in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We believe that the accounting policy described in Note 2 is critical in order to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations.
We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. At the time of the preparation of the financial statements, our management is required to use estimates, evaluations and assumptions which affect the application of the accounting policy and the amounts reported for assets, obligations, income and expenses. Any estimates and assumptions are continually reviewed. The changes to the accounting estimates are credited during the period in which the change to the estimate is made.
Stock-based Compensation
Employees and other service providers of the Company may receive benefits by way of stock-based compensation settled with company options exercised for shares of our Common Stock. The cost of transactions with employees settled with capital instruments is measured based on the fair value of the capital instruments on the granting date. The fair value is determined using an accepted options pricing model. The model is based on share price, grant date and on assumptions regarding expected volatility and expected lifespan.
The cost of the transactions settled with capital instruments is recognized in profit or loss together with a corresponding increase in the equity over the period in which the performance and/or service takes place, and ending on the date on which the relevant employees are entitled to the benefits (the “Vesting Period”). The aggregate expense recognized for transactions settled with capital instruments at the end of each reporting date and until the Vesting Period reflects the degree to which the Vesting Period has expired. The expense or income in profit or loss reflects the change of the aggregate expense recognized as of the end of the reported period.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures. Since our inception through December 31, 2021, we have funded our operations principally with approximately $16 million (net of issuance expenses) from the issuance of shares of shares of our Common Stock, options and loans.
The table below presents our cash flows for the periods indicated:
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash of $6,750,938, as compared to $242,900 as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had a working capital of $6,297,793, as compared to a negative working capital of $290,062 as of December 31, 2020. The increase in our cash balance is mainly attributable to our net loss described above and payments to account payables offset by our equity financing and convertible loans.
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $4,098,266 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $798,740 for the year ended December 31, 2020 an increase of $3,299,526. The increase is mainly attributable to our net loss of $4,865,376 as well as increase in other current assets and other liabilities and operating lease liabilities, partially offset by increase in share based compensation and Increase in accounts payable.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $82,790 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $6,734 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is mainly attributable to the increase in funds in respect of employee rights upon retirement and the purchase of property and equipment.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $10,725,016 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $741,760 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is mainly the result of proceeds from to the Underwritten Offering described above.
Financial Arrangements
Since our inception, we have financed our operation primarily through proceeds from sales of our shares of Common Stock and convertible loan agreements.
On June 24, 2020, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “June 2020 SPA”) with the December 2019 Lenders in connection with the sale and issuance of 67,369 units, at a purchase price of $7.63 per unit.

Current Outlook
We have financed our operations to date primarily through proceeds from sales of our shares of Common Stock. We have incurred losses and generated negative cash flows from operations since inception in 2009. Most of our revenues are currently generated in U.S. dollars from the sale of our products and services.
As of December 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents were $6,750,938. We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our current operations until at least August 2023. In addition, our operating plans may change as a result of many factors that may currently be unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
● the progress and costs of our studies and other research and development activities;
● the costs of manufacturing our products;
● the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approval for our products;
● the costs of filing, prosecuting, enforcing and defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights;
● the potential costs of contracting with third parties to provide marketing and distribution services for us or for building such capacities internally; and
● the magnitude of our general and administrative expenses.
