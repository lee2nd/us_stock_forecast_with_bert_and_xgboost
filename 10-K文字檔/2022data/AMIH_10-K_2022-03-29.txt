Plan of Operations
The Company intends to continue to grow its business both organically and by identifying acquisition targets over the next twelve months in the telemedicine, life coaching and wellness space. As these opportunities arise, the Company will determine the best method for financing its growth, which may include the issuance of additional debt instruments, common stock, preferred stock, or a combination thereof, any of which may cause significant dilution to existing shareholders. We expect to raise funds in the future through the sale of debt and/or equity in order to allow us to operate for the next twelve months, and may need to raise further additional capital in order to expedite our growth through acquisitions, none of which are currently planned.

Results of Operations
Revenues
We had revenues of $20,169 and $2,115 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in revenues in 2021 was due primarily to our change in business strategy. We recognized revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606. A five-step process has been designed for the individual or pool of contracts to keep financial statements focused on this principle. Revenues from fixed-price and cost-plus contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method, whereby revenues on long-term contracts were recorded on the basis of the Company’s estimates of the percentage of completion of contracts based on the ratio of actual cost incurred to total estimated costs. This cost-to-cost method was used because management considered it to be the best available measure of progress on these contacts. Revenues from cost-plus-fee contracts were recognized on the basis of costs incurred during the period plus the fee earned, measured on the cost-to-cost method. Revenues from time-and-material and rate chart contracts were recognized currently as work is performed. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized revenues of $20,169 in connection with membership income from ZipDoctor. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized revenues of $2,115.
Cost of Revenues
We had cost of revenues of $39,738 and $0 during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cost of revenues include all direct material, sub-contractor, labor and certain other direct costs, as well as those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor and fringe benefits. Selling, general, and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred.
Operating Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $6,975,654 and $3,711,317 during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in 2021 was due primarily to stock-based compensation in the amount of $4,986,143 (including $4,334,857 in stock issued for services rendered and $601,852 in stock issued for in process research and development), which totaled $2,860,813 in 2020, stock-and professional expenses incurred as a public company such as legal expenses in the amount of $242,293 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $112,175 for the year ended December 31, 2020, and financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance expenses in the amount of $131,608 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $99,003 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Other Expenses
During the year ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, we incurred interest expense of $184,589 and $219,202, respectively, of which $1,979 and $3,345, respectively, were recorded as imputed interest in connection with related party loans.
Amortization of debt discount was $1,958,298 and $777,964 during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
We had a loss of $1,071,028 and a loss of $107,574 during the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, due to change in derivative liabilities. See also “Note 12 - Derivative Liabilities”, in the notes to unconsolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data” of this Report, for a more detailed discussion of gain (loss) in derivative liabilities which is non-cash.
We had a settlement loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $16,359 compared to a settlement loss of $1,041,445 for the year ended December 31, 2020, each in connection with debt settlements that occurred during the respective periods.
We also had no impairment loss for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to an impairment loss of $605,488 for the year ended December 31, 2020 in connection with the common shares issued for notes settlement during the applicable period.
Discontinued operations
Customer traffic and demand at our VISSIA Waterway, Inc. and VISSIA McKinney MedSpa locations which were re-opened after mandatory closures associated with COVID-19 in June and August 2020, respectively, failed to rebound to pre-closure levels due to COVID-19 and the pandemic’s effects on the economy, and because we are unable to predict the length of the pandemic or ultimate outcome thereof, and further due to our limited capital resources, effective in October 2020, we made the decision to close both our VISSIA Waterway, Inc. and VISSIA McKinney locations and discontinued such operations. As such locations are closed, they are not generating any revenue. The continuing expenses, without corresponding revenues, may have a significant negative affect on our results of operations and cash flows. Separately, Legend Nutrition’s lease was up January 31, 2021, and the Company chose not to renew the lease, closed the store, and not continue in that line of business moving forward.
VISSIA Waterway, Inc., VISSIA McKinney LLC Legend Nutrition and Capitol City Solutions USA, Inc. (collectively referred to as “Discontinued Subsidiaries”) have been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, and are summarized below:
Net Loss
We had a net loss of $9,980,911, or $0.14 per share from continuing operations and net income of $244,586 or $0.00 per share from discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2021, for a total net loss of $10,008,362 or $0.14 per share. We had a net loss of $7,339,890, or $0.18 per share from continuing operations and $879,237 or $0.02 per share from discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2020, totaling an aggregate of $7,339,890 or $0.18 per share in total net loss. The increase in net loss in 2021 was primarily attributable to non-cash expenses in connection with stock-based compensation, amortization of debt discount, the change in derivative values associated with outstanding convertible debt, settlement loss in connection with the common shares issued for notes settlement, and the decrease in gross profit and revenues, each as discussed above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had total assets of $1,213,647 and $38,539, respectively, including $0 and $0 of assets of discontinued operations, respectively. The main reason for the increase in total assets as of December 31, 2021, compared to December 30, 2020, was due to a $1,184,593 increase in cash, which was mainly due to the proceeds received from the Company’s financing activities and issuances of convertible notes, offset by the $208,984 decrease in assets of discontinued operations.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had total liabilities of $5,100,557 and $1,656,529, respectively, which consisted of accounts payable, accrued interest and accrued compensation in the amount of $252,194 and $211,271, respectively, convertible notes payable (net of discount) and loans payable to related parties and non-related parties (net of discount) in the amounts of $396,419, $75,000 and $123,473 and $74,827, $55,000 and $135,392 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and derivative liabilities of $4,141,272 and $517,366, respectively. We also had $112,199 and $669,574 of net liabilities related to discontinued operations. The Company had a total stockholders’ deficit of $3,869,111 and $1,391,007 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities was $2,211,762, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $2,153,263 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Negative cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2021, were due primarily to the net loss of $10,225,497 and change in derivative liabilities of $2,469,697, partially offset by non-cash expenses, including stock-based compensation of $4,334,857, amortization of debt discount of $1,958,298, derivative expense of $3,540,725, loss on loans settlement of $58,059, and in process research and development of $601,852 Comparatively, negative cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2020, were due primarily to the net loss of $6,460,653, partially offset by non-cash expenses, including stock-based compensation of $2,860,813, amortization of debt discount of $777,965, loss on loans settlement by $1,155,685, and impairment loss of $670,280.
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had cash provided by investing activities of $10,000 and cash used in investing activities of $27,392, respectively. The net cash used in investing activities in each year was solely attributable to capital expenditures for and disposal of property and equipment.
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, net cash flows provided by financing activities were $3,386,335 and $947,180, respectively, primarily attributable to the proceeds from notes payable to related parties and non-related parties during the respective periods. We had proceeds of $141,928 from related party borrowings and $3,738,999 from non-related party borrowings in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to proceeds of $0 from related party borrowings and proceeds of $947,750 from non-related party borrowings in the year ended December 31, 2020. We made repayments of $141,9289 on related party borrowings and repayments of $427,500 on non-related party borrowings in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to repayments of $40,000 on non-related party borrowings and repayments of $0 on related party borrowings in the year ended December 31, 2020. We had proceeds of $100,000 from sales of stock in 2021, which was $46,500 in 2020.
We had cash of $1,209,737 and a working capital deficit of $3,886,910 as of December 31, 2021. On the short-term basis, we will be required to raise a significant amount of additional funds over the next 12 months to sustain operations and pay outstanding liabilities. On the long-term basis, we will potentially need to raise capital to grow and develop our business.
Since December 31, 2019, we have (a) sold 330,250 shares of our common stock in consideration for $146,500 in cash through our Regulation A offering, which related to the sale of up to 10,800,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.50 per share, which has since been terminated; and (b) issued 36,236,429 shares of our common stock in exchange for the conversion of $2,832,852 in debt.
On September 27, 2021, October 29, 2021, November 2, 2021, and November 12, 2021, Jacob Cohen, our Chief Executive Officer, advanced the Company, $50,000, $15,000, $10,000, and $40,000, respectively, which loans are payable upon demand and not bearing interest. This amount was repaid in November 2021.
It is likely that we will require significant additional financing within the next 12 months and if we are unable to raise the needed funds on an acceptable basis, we may be forced to cease or curtail operations.
Additional information regarding the Company’s (a) accrued compensation for related parties can be found in “Note 10 - Accrued Compensation for Related Parties”; (b) notes payable can be found in “Note 10 - Notes Payable”; (c) related party loans can be found in “Note 11 - Loans from Related Parties”; derivative liabilities can be found in “Note 12 - Derivative Liabilities”; billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings can be found in “Note 13 - Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contract”, in the notes to unconsolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data” of this Report.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See “Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the audited financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data”, of this Report.
Revenue Recognition
The Company generates its revenue from monthly membership subscriptions. Revenue is recognized at the time of delivery and includes a delivery fee for each delivery or a subscription fee on a monthly basis for memberships. Under Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09 (Topic 606) “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, revenue from contracts with customers is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with the customer, and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer and is the unit of account under Topic 606. The Company’s contracts with its customers do not include multiple performance obligations. The Company recognizes revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for such products or services.
The Company’s subsidiaries, EPIQ MD, Inc. and ZipDoctor, Inc. both provide its customers with access to its telemedicine platform where customers have unlimited access to start a doctor visit 24/7. The customers pay a flat fee per month for use of the platform and is not dependent on the frequency of the doctor visits. Each doctor visit is included in the monthly subscription fee.
EPIQ MD: The base monthly subscription fees range from $24.95-$49.95 per month and is dependent on the number of family members included in the plan. Customers can choose to add additional services, such as Epiq Paws and Epiq Lux, ranging from an additional $4.95-$9.95 per month.
The customer gains immediate access to the telemedicine platform upon completing the enrollment process and making the first month’s payment, at which point the Company recognizes the revenue from that customer. Billing commences on the day that the customer is enrolled for the Company’s services and is continued to be billed on the calendar day of each calendar month, in accordance with the original date of enrollment.
Customer’s may cancel their subscription at any time provided that they provide the Company with thirty (30) days advanced written notice of cancellation with no cancellation fees charged to the customer. In the event a subscriber provides a notice of cancellation within the membership period, the customer will be billed on their regular billing date at an amount adjusted to reflect an amount due until the cancellation date.
For avoidance of doubt, if a subscriber is billed $29.95 on the 1st of the month and cancels on the 15th, the subscriber will be billed on the 1st of the following month at a prorated rate through the 15th, or at a rate of $14.97.
ZipDoctor, Inc: The base monthly subscription fees range from $25.00-$45.00 per month and is dependent on the number of family members included in the plan. The customer gains immediate access to the telemedicine platform upon completing the enrollment process and making the first month’s payment, at which point the Company recognizes the revenue from that customer. Billing commences on the day that the customer is enrolled for the Company’s services and is continued to be billed on the calendar day of each calendar month, in accordance with the original date of enrollment.
Customer’s may cancel their subscription at any time provided that they provide the Company with thirty (30) days advanced written notice of cancellation with no cancellation fees charged to the customer. In the event a subscriber provides a notice of cancellation within the membership period, the customer will be billed on their regular billing date at an amount adjusted to reflect an amount due until the cancellation date.
For avoidance of doubt, if a subscriber is billed $25.00 on the 1st of the month and cancels on the 15th, the subscriber will be billed on the 1st of the following month at a prorated rate through the 15th, or at a rate of $12.50.
LEGEND NUTRITION - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
The Company recognizes revenue in according with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606. The underlying principle is that the Company recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that they expect to be entitled to in the exchange for goods and services provided.
The Company’s discontinued subsidiary, Legend Nutrition, Inc., operated a retail store in which it sold nutritional and wellness related products. Legend’s business was solely based on the sale of retail products and did not offer any non-tangible services.
Revenue for the entire product sold was recognized when the customer purchased and had control of the product, even if the terms included a right of return. Legend accounted for any discounts and concessions at the time of sale and accounted for returns and refunds when Legend received the product back in its possession where in some instances, if the product was unused, would be returned to Legend’s inventory or, if used, would be discarded.
Costs of revenue included the amounts that Legend paid its wholesalers and distributors and recognized the cost of revenue when the products were sold and transferred to the possession of the customer. The cost of revenue was deducted from Legends open inventory balance upon sale.
Fair value of financial instruments
The Company measures its financial and non-financial assets and liabilities, as well as makes related disclosures, in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), which provides guidance with respect to valuation techniques to be utilized in the determination of fair value of assets and liabilities. Approaches include, (i) the market approach (comparable market prices), (ii) the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and (iii) the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). ASC 820 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:
Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.
Our financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable, other receivable, inventories, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, convertible note payable, and derivative liabilities.
The carrying values of the Company’s cash, accounts receivable, other receivable, inventories, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature.
The Company’s convertible notes payable are measured at amortized cost.
The derivative liabilities are stated at their fair value as a level 3 measurement. The Company used the Lattice Model to determine the fair values of these derivative liabilities. See “Note 12 - Derivative Liabilities” of the financial statements included herein, for the Company’s assumptions used in determining the fair value of these financial instruments.
Convertible note payable
The Company accounts for convertible notes payable in accordance with the Under Financial Accounting Standard Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification No. 815, Derivatives and Hedging, since the conversion feature is not indexed to the Company’s stock and can’t be classified in equity. The Company allocates the proceeds received from convertible notes payable between the liability component and conversion feature component. The conversion feature that is considered embedded derivative liabilities has been recorded at their fair value as its fair value can be separated from the convertible note and its conversion is independent of the underlying note value. The Company has also recorded the resulting discount on debt related to the conversion feature and is amortizing the discount using the effective interest rate method over the life of the debt instruments.
Derivative liabilities
The Company accounts for derivative liabilities in accordance with the FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). ASC 815 requires companies to recognize all derivative liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value, and marks it to market at each reporting date with the resulting gains or losses shown in the Statement of Operations.
Stock based compensation
The Company recognizes compensation costs to employees under FASB Accounting Standards Codification 718 “Compensation - Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”). Under ASC 718, companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share based compensation arrangements include stock options and warrants. As such, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at their fair value. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the option grant.
On July 27, 2018, the inception date, the Company adopted ASU No. 2018-07 “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting.” These amendments expand the scope of Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (which currently only includes share-based payments to employees) to include share-based payments issued to nonemployees for goods or services. Consequently, the accounting for share-based payments to nonemployees and employees will be substantially aligned.
