Overview
We are a provider of satellite-based hardware, airtime and related services both in the United States and internationally. We sell equipment and airtime for use on all of the major satellite networks including Globalstar, Inmarsat, Iridium and Thuraya and operate a short-term rental service for customers who desire to use our equipment for a limited time period. Our acquisition of GTC in February 2015 expanded our global satellite-based infrastructure and business, which was first launched in December 2014 through the purchase of certain contracts.
March 2021 Financing
On March 5, 2021, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the “March 2021 NPA”) by and between the Company and one individual accredited investor (the “Lender”). Pursuant to the terms of the March 2021 NPA, the Company sold a convertible promissory note with a principal amount of $350,000 (the “March 2021 Note”). The March 2021 Note was a general, unsecured obligation of the Company and bears simple interest at a rate of 7% per annum and matures on the third anniversary of the date of issuance (the “Maturity Date”), to the extent that the March 2021 Note and the principal amount and any interest accrued thereunder have not been converted into shares of the Company’s common stock. In the event that any amount due under the March 2021 Note was not paid as and when due, such amount will accrue interest at the rate of 12% per year, simple interest, non-compounding, until paid. The Company may not pre-pay or redeem the March 2021 Note other than as required by the Agreement. The Noteholder had an optional right of conversion such that a Noteholder may elect to convert his March 2021 Note, in whole or in part, outstanding as of such time, into the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Company’s common stock as determined by dividing the indebtedness under the March 2021 Note price equal to the lesser of (a) $7.50 per share, and (b) a 30% discount to the price of the common stock in the qualified transaction. Following an event of default, the conversion price shall be adjusted to be equal to the lower of: (i) the then applicable conversion price or (ii) the price per share of 85% of the lowest traded price for the Company’s common stock during the 15 trading days preceding the relevant conversion. In addition, subject to the ownership limitations, if a qualified transaction is completed, without further action from the Noteholder, on the closing date of the qualified transaction, 50% of the principal amount of this March 2021 Note and all accrued and unpaid interest shall be converted into Company common stock at a conversion price equal to the 30% discount to the offering price in such qualified transaction, which price shall be proportionately adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends or similar events. A “Qualified Transaction” refers the completion of the public offering of the Company’s securities stock with gross proceeds of at least $10,000,000 pursuant to which the Company’s securities become registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or a merger with a company listed on the Nasdaq or Canadian stock exchanges, as amended. The Noteholder is granted registration rights and pre-emptive rights. In addition, the March 2021 NPA includes customary events of default, including, among others: (i) non-payment of amounts due thereunder, (ii) non-compliance with covenants thereunder, (iii) bankruptcy or insolvency. The Company’s issuance of the March 2021 Note under the terms of the March 2021 NPA was made pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as a transaction by an issuer not involving a public offering. The investor in the March 2021 Note is an “accredited investor” as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act. There were no discounts or brokerage fees associated with this offering. The Company used the offering proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes.
Listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market
Our shares have been listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market since May 28, 2021. Our common stock and warrants have been trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “NXPL” and “NXPLW,” respectively, since January 21, 2022. Prior to January 21, 2022, our common stock and warrants were traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “OSAT” and “OSATW,” respectively.
Reverse Stock Split
We effected a reverse stock split of our common stock at a ratio of 1-for-5 as of 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time, on May 28, 2021. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse stock split and all such fractional interests were rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares of common stock. The conversion or exercise prices of our issued and outstanding convertible securities, stock options and warrants will be adjusted accordingly. All information presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise indicated herein, assumes a 1-for-5 reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock, and unless otherwise indicated, all such amounts and corresponding conversion price or exercise price data set forth herein have been adjusted to give effect to such assumed reverse stock split.
June Public Offering
On May 28, 2021, Company, entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Maxim Group LLC (the “Underwriter”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to the Underwriter in an underwritten public offering (the “June Offering”) 2,880,000 units consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant exercisable for one share of common stock at a public offering price of $5.00 per unit (after giving effect to a 1-for-5 reverse stock split, discussed above) for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $14,400,000 before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering expenses. The common stock and warrants were immediately separable and were issued separately. The common stock and warrants began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market, on May 28, 2021, under the symbols “OSAT” and “OSATW,” respectively. In addition, the Company granted the Underwriter a 45-day option to purchase an additional 432,000 shares of common stock and/or warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 432,000 shares of common stock, in any combination thereof, at the public offering price per security, less the underwriting discounts and commissions, to cover over-allotments, if any. The June Offering closed on June 2, 2021.
In connection with closing of the June Offering, the Underwriter partially exercised its overallotment option and purchased an additional 432,000 warrants at $0.01 per warrant for additional gross proceeds to the Company of $4,320. On June 28, 2021, the Underwriter, upon the exercise in full of the balance of its over-allotment option, purchased 432,000 additional shares of the common stock for additional gross and net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts of $2,160,000 and $1,983,225, respectively.
We have issued to the Underwriter warrants to purchase up to a total of 144,000 shares of common stock (5% of the shares of common stock included in the Units, excluding the over-allotment, if any) (the “Underwriter Warrants”). The Underwriter Warrants are exercisable at any time, and from time to time, in whole or in part, during the period commencing 180 days from the effective date of the registration statement and expire five years from the effective date of the offering, which period is in compliance with FINRA Rule 5110(e). The Underwriter Warrants are exercisable at a per share price equal to $5.50 per share, or 110% of the public offering price per unit in the offering. The Underwriter Warrants have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a 180-day lock-up pursuant to Rule 5110(e)(1) of FINRA. The underwriter (or permitted assignees under Rule 5110(e)(2)) will not sell, transfer, assign, pledge, or hypothecate these warrants or the securities underlying these warrants, nor will they engage in any hedging, short sale, derivative, put, or call transaction that would result in the effective economic disposition of the warrants or the underlying securities for a period of 180 days from the effective date of the registration statement. In addition, the warrants provide for certain piggyback registration rights. The piggyback registration rights provided will not be greater than five years from the effective date of the registration statement in compliance with FINRA Rule 5110(g)(8). We will bear all fees and expenses attendant to registering the securities issuable on exercise of the Underwriter Warrants. The exercise price and number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Underwriter Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, extraordinary cash dividend or our recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the warrant exercise price or underlying shares will not be adjusted for issuances of shares of common stock at a price below the warrant exercise price.
The June Offering of common stock and warrants, and the underwriter’s exercise of the over-allotment option in connection therewith, resulted in total gross proceeds of approximately $16,560,000, before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering expenses.
Distribution of Our Products Through Alibaba
On July 13, 2021, we announced that our Global Telesat Communications (“GTC”) unit has entered into an agreement with Alibaba.com, the B2B (Business-to-Business) e-commerce website owned and operated by Alibaba Group Holding Limited, also known as Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA; HKEX: 9988), a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in e-commerce, retail, internet, and technology. GTC is a Gold-level Supplier on Alibaba.com, the world’s largest Business-to-Business (B2B) e-commerce website. Under the agreement, GTC significantly expanded its 24/7/365 e-commerce presence with the launch of its latest global storefront on Alibaba.com on which it offers a range of satellite IoT and connectivity products. These will include our specialized satellite tracking products, some of which operate using the Company’s many ground station-based network processors, and can be used to track and monitor the location of cars, trucks, trailers, boats, containers, animals, and other remote assets. Although we currently have a limited range of products available through the Alibaba storefront due to supply chain constrictions, we plan to ultimately have up to 500 products and connectivity services available on Alibaba.com. The agreement will continue on a year-to-year basis.
January 2022 Private Placement of Common Stock
On December 31, 2021, after markets closed, a securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) was circulated to, and signatures were received from, certain institutional and accredited investors (the “December Investors”) in connection with the sale in a private placement by the Company of 2,229,950 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “December Offering”). On January 2, 2022, the Company delivered to December Investors a fully executed Purchase Agreement, which was dated December 31, 2021. The purchase price for the common stock sold in the December Offering was $3.24 per share, the closing transaction price reported by Nasdaq on December 31, 2021.
The closing of the December Offering occurred on January 5, 2022. The Company received gross proceeds from the sale of the common stock in the December Offering of approximately $7.2 million. The Company intends to use the proceeds from the December Offering for general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions and joint ventures. Approximately 73% of funds raised in the December Offering were secured from existing shareholders and from the members of the Company’s senior management and Board of Directors.
In connection with the December Offering, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with the December Investors (the “Registration Rights Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, the Company agreed to prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement to register for resale the shares of the Company’s common stock sold in the Offering.
The shares of common stock offered and sold in the December Offering were sold in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act and corresponding provisions of state securities or “blue sky” laws.
The terms of the transaction disclosed above, including the provisions of the Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement, were approved by the Board of Directors and because some of the securities were offered and sold to officers and directors of the Company, such terms were separately reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
January 2022 Name Change
On January 18, 2022, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada in order to change the Company’s corporate name from Orbsat Corp to NextPlat Corp. This name change was effective as of January 21, 2022. The name change was approved by the Company’s stockholders at the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders held on December 16, 2021.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s applications of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for our company include accounting for stock-based compensation.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition in the consolidated financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award.
Pursuant to ASC Topic 718, for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is determined at the “measurement date.” The expense is recognized over the vesting period of the award. Until the measurement date is reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. The Company initially records compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date. Further, ASC Topic 718, provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718, such as the repricing of share options, which would revalue those options and the accounting for the cancellation of an equity award whether a replacement award or other valuable consideration is issued in conjunction with the cancellation. If not, the cancellation is viewed as a replacement and not a modification, with a repurchase price of $0.
Use of Estimates
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the statements of financial condition, and revenues and expenses for the years then ended. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates. Significant estimates made by management include, but are not limited to, the assumptions used to calculate stock-based compensation, derivative liabilities and common stock issued for services.
Effect of Exchange Rate on Results
The Company’s reporting currency is U.S. Dollars. The accounts of one of the Company’s subsidiaries, GTC, is maintained using the appropriate local currency, Great British Pound, as the functional currency. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at balance sheet date, shareholders’ equity is translated at historical rates and revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average exchange rate for the year or the reporting period. The translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity, captioned as accumulated other comprehensive (loss) gain. Transaction gains and losses arising from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the statements of operations.
The relevant translation rates are as follows: for the year ended December 31, 2021, closing rate at 1.353372 US$: GBP, yearly average rate at 1.375083 US$: GBP for the year ended December 31, 2020, closing rate at 1.3665 US$: GBP, yearly average rate at 1.286618 US$: GBP
For the year ended December 31, 2021, GTC represents 68.8% of total company sales and as such, currency rate variances have an impact on results. The net effect on revenues were impacted by the differences in exchange rate from yearly average exchange of 1.286618 to 1.375083. Had the yearly average rate remained, sales would have been lower by $459,458. GTC comparable sales in GBP, its home currency, increased 34.0% or £984,146, from £2,890,408 to £3,874,554 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to December 31, 2020.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, GTC represents 64.1% of total company sales and as such, currency rate variances have an impact on results. The net effect on revenues were impacted by the differences in exchange rate from yearly average exchange of 1.276933 to 1.286618. Had the yearly average rate remained, sales would have been lower by $35,347. GTC comparable sales in GBP, its home currency, decreased 8.0% or £251,733, from £3,142,634 to £2,890,901 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to December 31, 2019.
Results of Operations
Net Revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, revenues generated were approximately $7,739,910 and $5,689,796, an increase of $2,050,114 or 36.0%. Revenues were derived primarily from the sales of satellite phones, locator beacons, IoT GPS trackers, terminals, accessories and additional and recurring airtime plans. Comparable sales for Orbital Satcom Corp. increased 22.4% or $441,132, from $1,970,944 to $2,412,076. Comparable sales for GTC increased 43.3% or $1,608,982, from $3,718,851 to $5,327,833. The overall sales increase is attributable to increased sales through Amazon storefronts and product selections, which constituted 63.6% and 73.3% of our total sales for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
Approximately 63.6% of our products are sold on Amazon and are subject to Amazon’s terms of service and various other Amazon seller policies that apply to third parties selling products on Amazon’s marketplace. Amazon’s terms of service provide, among other things, that it may terminate or suspend its agreement with any seller or any of its services being provided to a seller at any time and for any reason. In addition, if Amazon determines that any seller’s actions or performance, including ours, may result in violations of its terms or policies, or create other risks to Amazon or to third parties, then Amazon may in its sole discretion withhold any payments owed for as long as Amazon determines any related risk to Amazon or to third parties persist. Further, if Amazon determines that any seller’s, including our, accounts have been used to engage in deceptive, fraudulent or illegal activity, or that such accounts have repeatedly violated its policies, then Amazon may in its sole discretion permanently withhold any payments owed. In addition, Amazon in its sole discretion may suspend a seller account and product listings if Amazon determines that a seller has engaged in conduct that violates any of its policies. Any limitation or restriction on our ability to sell on Amazon’s platform could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. We also rely on services provided by Amazon’s fulfillment platform which provides for expedited shipping to the consumer, an important aspect in the buying decision for consumers. Any inability to market our products for sale with delivery could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Failure to remain compliant with the fulfillment practices on Amazon’s platform could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
Cost of Sales. During the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, cost of revenues increased to $5,880,187 compared to $4,464,476 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $1,415,711 or 31.7%. We expect our cost of revenues to increase during fiscal 2022 and beyond, as we expand our operations and begin generating additional revenues under our current business. However, we are unable at this time to estimate the amount of the expected increases. Gross profit margins during the year ended December 31, 2021, and 2020 were 24.0% and 21.5%, respectively. The increase in margin was attributable to new product lines with higher margins.
Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $8,482,056, an increase of $5,222,856, or 160.3%, from total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, of $3,259,200.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,369,936 and $694,361 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing an increase of $675,575 or 97.3%. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in medical premiums of $38,441, due to additional employees, premiums related to D&O insurance of $143,575, and a general increase in variable expenses which fluctuate as sales increase.
Salaries, wages and payroll taxes were $1,838,531 and $769,391 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing an increase of $1,069,140, or 139.0%. The increase was attributable to an increase in officers, personnel and increased payroll to meet legal minimum in the UK.
Stock-based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were non-cash expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded $3,758,424 and $904,900 for stock-based compensation, an increase of $2,853,524 or 315.3%. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the expense was for recruiting and retaining executive management as well as increasing the number of directors, which resulted in an amount of $2,481,071 for awards of restricted stock and $1,277,353 related to the grant of options. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the expense was for the issuance of 2,752,000 fully vested options to purchase shares of the Company’s stock to management and a director with an average exercise price of $0.24 and the issuance of 30,000 shares of the Company’s stock to consultants valued at $74,000.
Professional fees were $1,198,063 and $595,622 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing an increase of $602,441 or 101.1%. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the increase in professional fees were primarily for; legal and other fees related to the public company expenses of $358,781, director fees of $97,791, associated with the addition of four independent directors, and capital raising professional fees of $145,869. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the increase was primarily due to an increase in fees to consultants of $143,406 and fees for investor relations of $17,500, relating to equity raising services, offset by a decrease of; legal expenses of $26,770, accounting fees of $21,205 and a reduction of public company expense of $8,564.
Depreciation and amortization expenses were $317,102 and $294,926 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing an increase of $22,176, or 7.5%. The increase was attributable to increase in fixed assets.
We expect our expenses in each of these areas to continue to increase during fiscal 2022 and beyond as we expand our operations and begin generating additional revenues under our current business. However, we are unable at this time to estimate the amount of the expected increases.
Total Other (Income) Expense. Our total other expenses were $1,485,329 and $729,495 during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing an increase of $755,834 or 103.6%. The increase was attributable to the Company’s increase in interest expense of $445,276 due to convertible notes payable, exchange rate variances and gain on extinguishment of debt in 2020 of $269,261.
Net Loss before Income Taxes. We recorded net loss before income tax of $8,107,662 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to a net loss of $2,763,375, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is a result of the factors as described above.
Provision for Income Taxes and Income Tax Expense. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded income tax expense of $0 and $0, respectively.
Net Loss. We recorded net loss after income tax of $8,107,662 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to a net loss of $2,763,375 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is a result of the factors as described above.
Comprehensive Loss. We recorded a gain (loss) for foreign currency translation adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 of $46,068 and $(40,680), respectively. The fluctuations of the increase/decrease are primarily attributable to exchange rate variances. Comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $8,061,594 as compared to loss of $2,804,055 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since inception we have incurred and continue to incur significant losses from operations. Historically, cash flow from operations has not been sufficient to further the growth of the Company’s core business. The combined proceeds from the June Offering of $16,560,000 and December Offering of $7,225,038 provides sufficient cash resources for the Company to meet its operating needs. Furthermore, the available cash resources permit investment to expand existing business, investments in expanding our e-commerce platforms, and the development of digital asset initiatives. Should these initiatives and results from operations not prove successful, we will need to raise additional capital through debt facilities, and/or public or private equity or debt financings to continue operations. The Company can provide no assurance as to the successful conclusion of the financings.
Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. At December 31, 2021, we had a cash balance of $17,267,978 and working capital is $16,594,207. We reported a net increase in cash for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to December 31, 2020, of $16,539,216 primarily as a result of net cash proceeds received proceeds from the June Public Offering.
We believe that our existing working capital and our future cash flows from operating activities will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our operating needs for the next twelve months.

On May 28, 2021, Company, entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Maxim Group LLC (the “Underwriter”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to the Underwriter in an underwritten public offering (the “June Offering”) 2,880,000 units consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant exercisable for one share of common stock at a public offering price of $5.00 per unit (after giving effect to a 1-for-5 reverse stock split, discussed above) for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $14,400,000 before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering expenses. The common stock and warrants were immediately separable and were issued separately. The common stock and warrants began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market, on May 28, 2021, under the symbols “OSAT” and “OSATW,” respectively. In addition, the Company granted the Underwriter a 45-day option to purchase an additional 432,000 shares of common stock and/or warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 432,000 shares of common stock, in any combination thereof, at the public offering price per security, less the underwriting discounts and commissions, to cover over-allotments, if any. The June Offering closed on June 2, 2021.
In connection with closing of the June Offering, the Underwriter partially exercised its overallotment option and purchased an additional 432,000 warrants at $0.01 per warrant for additional gross proceeds to the Company of $4,320. On June 28, 2021, the Underwriter, upon the exercise in full of the balance of its over-allotment option, purchased 432,000 additional shares of the common stock for additional gross and net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts of $2,160,000 and $1,983,225, respectively.
We have also agreed to issue to the Underwriter (or its permitted assignees) warrants to purchase up to a total of 144,000 shares of common stock (5% of the shares of common stock included in the Units, excluding the over-allotment, if any) (the “Underwriter Warrants”). The Underwriter Warrants are exercisable at any time, and from time to time, in whole or in part, during the period commencing 180 days from the effective date of the registration statement and expire five years from the effective date of the offering, which period is in compliance with FINRA Rule 5110(e). The Underwriter Warrants are exercisable at a per share price equal to $5.50 per share, or 110% of the public offering price per unit in the offering. The Underwriter Warrants have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a 180-day lock-up pursuant to Rule 5110(e)(1) of FINRA. The underwriter (or permitted assignees under Rule 5110(e)(2)) will not sell, transfer, assign, pledge, or hypothecate these warrants or the securities underlying these warrants, nor will they engage in any hedging, short sale, derivative, put, or call transaction that would result in the effective economic disposition of the warrants or the underlying securities for a period of 180 days from the effective date of the registration statement. In addition, the warrants provide for certain piggyback registration rights. The piggyback registration rights provided will not be greater than five years from the effective date of the registration statement in compliance with FINRA Rule 5110(g)(8). We will bear all fees and expenses attendant to registering the securities issuable on exercise of the Underwriter Warrants. The exercise price and number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Underwriter Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, extraordinary cash dividend or our recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the warrant exercise price or underlying shares will not be adjusted for issuances of shares of common stock at a price below the warrant exercise price.
The June Offering of common stock and warrants, and the underwriter’s exercise of the over-allotment option in connection therewith, resulted in total gross proceeds of approximately $16,560,000 before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering expenses.

On March 5, 2021, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement by and between the Company and one individual accredited investor where the Company sold a convertible promissory note with a principal amount of $350,000 (the “March 2021 Note”).
