Introduction
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) describes SouthState Corporation and its subsidiary’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, and the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, and also analyzes our financial condition as of December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020. Like most banking institutions, we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments. Our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits, on most of which we pay interest. Consequently, one of the key measures of our success is the amount of net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits. Another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities.
There are risks inherent in all loans, so we maintain an allowance for credit losses to absorb our estimate of probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. We establish and maintain this allowance by recording a provision or recovery for credit losses against our earnings. In the following section, we have included a detailed discussion of this process.
In addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other services we charge to our customers. We incur costs in addition to interest expense on deposits and other borrowings, the largest of which is salaries and employee benefits. We describe the various components of this noninterest income and noninterest expense in the following discussion.
The following section also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements. We encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other information included in this Report.
Overview
SouthState Corporation is a financial holding company headquartered in Winter Haven, Florida, and was incorporated under the laws of South Carolina in 1985. We provide a wide range of banking services and products to our customers through our Bank. The Bank operates SouthState Advisory, Inc., a wholly owned registered investment advisor. The Bank also operates Duncan-Williams, Inc. (“Duncan-Williams”), which it acquired on February 1, 2021. Duncan-Williams is a registered broker-dealer, headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, that serves primarily institutional clients across the U.S. in the fixed income business. The Bank also owns CBI Holding Company, LLC (“CBI”), which in turn owns Corporate Billing, LLC (“Corporate Billing”), a transaction-based finance company headquartered in Decatur, Alabama that provides factoring, invoicing, collection and accounts receivable management services to transportation companies and automotive parts and service providers nationwide. The holding company also owns SSB Insurance Corp., a captive insurance subsidiary pursuant to Section 831(b) of the U.S. Tax Code. The holding company also owned R4ALL, Inc., which managed troubled loans purchased from the Bank. During the third quarter of 2021, the final loan held by R4ALL, Inc. paid off, and the holding company subsequently dissolved R4ALL, Inc. effective October 29, 2021.
At December 31, 2021, we had $42.0 billion in assets and 5,036 full-time equivalent employees. Through our Bank branches, ATMs and online banking platforms, we provide our customers with a wide range of financial products and services, through a six (6) state footprint in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. These financial products and services include deposit accounts such as checking accounts, savings and time deposits of various types, safe deposit boxes, bank money orders, wire transfer and ACH services, brokerage services and alternative investment products such as annuities and mutual funds, trust and asset management services, loans of all types, including business loans, agriculture loans, real estate-secured (mortgage) loans, personal use loans, home improvement loans, automobile loans, manufactured housing loans, boat loans, credit cards, letters of credit, home equity lines of credit, treasury management services, and merchant services.
We also operate a correspondent banking and capital markets division within our national bank subsidiary, of which the majority of its bond salesmen, traders and operational personnel are housed in facilities located in Birmingham, Alabama and Atlanta, Georgia. This division’s primary revenue generating activities are related to its capital markets division, which includes commissions earned on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities; and its correspondent banking division, which includes spread income earned on correspondent bank deposits (i.e., federal funds purchased) and correspondent bank checking account deposits and fees from safe-keeping activities, bond accounting services for correspondents, asset/liability consulting related activities, international wires, and other clearing and corporate checking account services. The correspondent banking and capital markets division was further expanded with the addition of Duncan-Williams on February 1, 2021.
We earned net income of $475.5 million, or $6.71 diluted earnings per share (“EPS”), during 2021 compared to net income of $120.6 million, or $2.19 diluted EPS, in 2020. Net income available to the common shareholders was up $354.9 million, or 294.2%, in 2021 compared to 2020. For further discussion of the Company’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, and the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, see Results of Operations section of this MD&A starting on page 57.
At December 31, 2021, we had total assets of approximately $42.0 billion compared to approximately $37.8 billion at December 31, 2020. See the Financial Condition section of this MD&A starting on page 68 for a more detailed description of the change in our balance sheet.
Our asset quality results remained strong in 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021, net charge offs as a percentage of average loans remained unchanged at 0.01% from the year ended December 31, 2020. The total Nonperforming Assets (“NPAs”) decreased $35.3 million to $83.7 million at December 31, 2021 from $119.1 million at December 31, 2020. Acquired NPAs decreased $29.4 million to $59.8 million at December 31, 2021 from $89.2 million
at December 31, 2020. Acquired nonperforming loans decreased $20.7 million and acquired OREO and other nonperforming assets decreased $8.7 million. Non-acquired NPAs decreased $6.0 million to $23.9 million at December 31, 2021 from $29.9 million at December 31, 2020. This decline was mainly related to a decline in non-acquired nonperforming loans which fell by $5.9 million from December 31, 2020. Non-acquired OREO and other NPAs remained stable in 2021 and decreased $98,000. The total NPAs as a percentage of total assets decreased 12 basis points to 0.20% at December 31, 2021 as compared to 0.32% at December 31, 2020.
Our efficiency ratio was 65.6% at December 31, 2021 compared to 67.5% at December 31, 2020. The positive change in our efficiency ratio was due to the effect of the 22.0% increase in the total of net interest income and noninterest income being greater than the effect of the 18.5% increase in noninterest expense. The main reason for the increase in net interest income and noninterest income was due to the Company having a full year’s effect of the income in 2021 from the merger with CSFL that occurred in June 2020. The lower percentage increase in noninterest expense was mainly due to the cost saves recognized since the merger with CSFL.
We continue to remain well-capitalized with a total risk-based capital ratio of 13.56% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 8.05%, as of December 31, 2021, compared to 14.24% and 8.27%, respectively, at December 31, 2020. The total risk-based capital ratio decreased in 2021 as total risk-weighted assets increased $1.7 billion, or 6.5%, while total risk-based capital (excluding the change in accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI) grew by $50.6 million, or 1.4%. The decrease in the total risk-based capital ratio at the Company was due to the percentage increase in total risk-based capital being less than the percentage increase in total risk-based assets. The reason for the lower percentage increase in the total risk-based capital at the Company was due the redemption of $25.0 million in subordinated debt and $38.5 million in trust preferred securities during the second quarter of 2021 that was included in total risked-based capital along with the amount of allowance for credit losses eligible for capital purposes declining $77.3 million with the releases of provision in 2021. The Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased from the prior year as tier 1 capital (excluding the change in AOCI) increased by $191.5 million or 6.4%, while total average eligible assets increased $3.4 billion, or 9.3%. The Tier 1 leverage ratio declined as the percentage increase in Tier 1 risk-based capital was less than the percentage increase in the average assets for regulatory capital purposes. The increase in average assets was mainly due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments from December 31, 2020 with deposits growing as the federal government has pushed funds into the market through stimulus programs, in addition to consumers remaining conservative in their spending habits. We believe our current capital ratios position us well to grow both organically and through certain strategic opportunities. For further discussion of the Company’s financial condition as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020, see Financial Condition section of this MD&A starting on page 68.
COVID-19
Although the economy has been recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine distributions and treatments are generally available, businesses throughout the United States and our customers are still being adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In many of the states in our market area, as the economies have been allowed to reopen, there has been an increase in cases of COVID-19 and several new variants of COVID-19 in 2021 that have caused cases to increase.
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve. The COVID-19 pandemic, and its associated impacts on trade (including supply chains and export levels), travel, employee productivity, unemployment, consumer spending, and other economic activities, initially resulted in less economic activity, lower equity market valuations and increased volatility and disruption in financial markets, and had an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of general operations, with a more limited impact to our correspondent banking and capital markets business lines. Those impacts declined as the economy reopened during the second half of 2021. However, the ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations is uncertain and will depend on various developments and other factors, including, among others, an increase in cases as a result of new waves of the pandemic or as new variants of the disease begin to circulate, how federal, state and local governments and the private sector respond, and the associated impacts on the economy, financial markets and our customers, employees and vendors.
Our business, financial condition and results of operations generally rely upon the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, the value of collateral underlying our secured loans, and demand for loans and other products and services we offer, which are highly dependent on the business environment in our primary markets where we operate and in the United States as a whole. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our business and operations.
As part of our efforts to practice social distancing, in March 2020, we closed all of our banking lobbies and began conducting most of our business through drive-thru tellers and through electronic and online means. To support the health and well-being of our employees, we allowed a majority of our non-customer facing workforce to work from home. In October 2020, we reopened our banking lobbies in our branch locations, but a majority of our support staff is still working from home. We anticipate the remaining support staff that has elected to return to the office will return in early 2022.
To support our customers or to comply with law, starting in 2020, we deferred loan payments from 90 to 360 days for consumer and commercial customers. We will continue to offer COVID-19 deferrals through September 30, 2022. For customers directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we suspended residential property foreclosure sales and involuntary automobile repossessions through October 1, 2020, which was the latest moratorium expiration for states in our footprint. Eviction actions were suspended through December 31, 2020 per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Agency Order 2020-19654. Additionally, we offered fee waivers, payment deferrals, and other expanded assistance for automobile, mortgage, small business and personal lending customers.
Also, we have extended credit to both customers and non-customers related to the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans. As of December 31, 2021, we have produced approximately 28,000 loans totaling approximately $3.2 billion through the PPP. Approximately $244.6 million of those PPP loans remain outstanding as of December 31, 2021.
The CFPB issued guidelines applicable to mortgage borrowers impacted by COVID-19 relating to loss mitigation and loan modifications which remain in effect from August 26, 2021 until September 30, 2022. We have confirmed that the Company’s current mortgage loan standards and processes meet all of the guidelines set forth by the CFPB. Future governmental actions may require more of these and other types of customer-related responses.
As of December 31, 2021, we have deferrals of $8.5 million, or 0.04%, of our total loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale and PPP loans. For commercial loans, the standard deferral was 90 days for both principal and interest, 120 days of principal only payments or 180 days of interest only payments. We have actively reached out to our customers to provide guidance and direction on these deferrals. In terms of available lines of credit, the Company has not experienced an increase in borrowers drawing down on their lines.
While deferrals have been decreasing materially since the third quarter of 2020, given the fluidity of the pandemic and the risk there may be new lockdowns or restrictions on business activities to slow the spread of the virus, there is no guarantee that some loans not currently on deferral might return to deferral status.
A restructuring that results in only a delay in payments that is insignificant is not considered an economic concession. In accordance with the CARES Act, the Company implemented loan modification programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms. The Company’s payment relief assistance includes forbearance, deferrals, extension and re-aging programs, along with certain other modification strategies. The Company elected the accounting policy in the CARES Act to suspend TDR accounting to loans modified for borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic if the concession met the criteria defined under the CARES Act.
We are continuously monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations and financial condition. With the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the Company changed its method for calculating its ACL for loans, investments, unfunded commitments and other financial assets. As a result of the new accounting standard, the Company changed its method for calculating its ACL for loans from an incurred loss method to a life of loan method. Considering the COVID-19 pandemic in our CECL models and moving to one CECL model (with the merged bank) during the third quarter of 2020, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $236.0 million in 2020. The recorded amount mainly was from the second quarter 2020, where the provision for credit losses was comprised of three major components: (1) $119.1 million for the day 1 provision for loans without significant credit deterioration (“Non-PCD”) acquired from CSFL, (2) $31.3 million from the legacy SouthState loan portfolio, and (3) $1.1 million from the acquired CSFL loan portfolio since the merger date. While there have been improvements in the economic forecasts during 2021, resulting in a recovery for credit losses of $165.3 million during the current year, there is continued uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic and its latest Omicron variant that may result in additional provision for credit losses in the future.
We also are monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on the valuation of goodwill. Additional detail in regards to
the goodwill analysis is disclosed below under the Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets section of the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.
Atlantic Capital Bancshares, Inc. Merger
On July 23, 2021, SouthState and Atlantic Capital announced that the two companies had entered into a Merger Agreement, which provides that upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Atlantic Capital will merge with and into SouthState, with SouthState continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger. The Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of the Company and Atlantic Capital’s shareholders. The Company received OCC’s approval for the pending merger in October 2021, and the Federal Reserve Board’s approval in February 2022.
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, shareholders of Atlantic Capital will receive 0.36 shares of SouthState’s common stock for each share of Atlantic Capital common stock they own. The transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2022. At December 31, 2021, Atlantic Capital reported $3.8 billion in total assets, $2.4 billion in loans and $3.3 billion in deposits.
CenterState Bank Corporation Merger
On June 7, 2020, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of CSFL, the holding company for CSB, in a stock transaction. Pursuant to the merger agreement, (i) CSFL merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger, and (ii) immediately following the Merger, SSB merged with and into CSB, with CSB continuing as the surviving bank in the Bank Merger. In connection with the Bank Merger, CSB changed its name to SouthState Bank, National Association. CSFL common shareholders received 0.3001 shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for each share of CSFL stock resulting in the Company issuing 37,271,069 shares of its common stock. In total, the purchase price for CSFL was $2.3 billion including the value of the conversion of outstanding warrants, stock options and restricted stock units totaling $10.3 million.
In the acquisition, the Company acquired $13.0 billion of loans (excluding loans held for sale) at fair value, net of $239.5 million, or 1.82%, estimated discount to the outstanding principal balance. Of the total loans acquired, Management identified $3.1 billion with credit deficiencies that were identified as Purchased Credit Deteriorated (“PCD”) loans. The Company assumed $15.6 billion in deposits including a $20.2 million premium for fixed maturity time deposits.
As a result of the Bank Merger, the Bank became a national banking association that is subject to primary
supervision and regulation by the OCC and subject to the National Bank Act, and is no longer subject to supervision and regulation by the SCBFI. In addition, the FDIC is no longer the Bank’s primary federal regulator, and the Bank is now a member of the Federal Reserve System.
Branch Consolidation and Other Cost Initiatives
As a part of the ongoing evaluation of customer service delivery and efficiencies, the Company consolidated branch locations in the first quarter of 2021. The annual savings in 2022 of these closures, which primarily includes personnel, facilities, and equipment cost, is expected to be $726,000, and the impact in 2021 was approximately $605,000. Two of the locations were in Florida and two in Georgia.
Capital Management
On January 27, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the authorization of a 3.5 million share Company stock repurchase plan (the “2021 Stock Repurchase Plan”). During 2021, the Company repurchased a total of 1,817,941 shares for $146.4 million or $80.51 per share (excluding commission expense).
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and follow general practices within the banking industry. Our financial position and results of operations are affected by Management’s application of accounting
policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Differences in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. Understanding our accounting policies is fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, our significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 1 of our audited consolidated financial statements.
The following is a summary of our critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and judgments.
Business Combinations
We account for acquisitions under FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, and liabilities assumed, are recorded at fair value. We adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, on January 1, 2020 which now requires us to record purchased financial assets with credit deterioration (PCD assets), defined as a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination or issuance, at the purchase price plus the allowance for credit losses expected at the time of acquisition. Under this method, there is no provision for credit losses affecting net income on acquisition of PCD assets. Changes in estimates of expected credit losses after acquisition are recognized as provision for credit loss expense (or recovery of credit losses) in subsequent periods as they arise. Any non-credit discount or premium resulting from acquiring a pool of purchased financial assets with credit deterioration shall be allocated to each individual asset. At the acquisition date, the initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis shall be allocated to individual assets to appropriately allocate any non-credit discount or premium. The non-credit discount or premium, after the adjustment for the allowance for credit losses, shall be accreted into interest income using the interest method based on the effective interest rate determined after the adjustment for credit losses at the adoption date.
A purchased financial asset that does not qualify as a PCD asset is accounted for similar to an originated financial asset. Generally, this means that an entity recognizes the allowance for credit losses for non-PCD assets through net income at the time of acquisition. In addition, both the credit discount and non-credit discount or premium resulting from acquiring a pool of purchased financial assets that do not qualify as PCD assets shall be allocated to each individual asset. This combined discount or premium shall be accreted into interest income using the effective yield method.
For further discussion of our loan accounting and acquisitions, see Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 2-Mergers and Acquisitions, Note 4-Loans and Note 5-Allowance for Credit Losses to the audited condensed consolidated financial statements.
Allowance for Credit Losses or ACL
The ACL reflects Management’s estimate of expected credit losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. Due to the Merger between the Company and CSFL, effective June 7, 2020, Management collectively evaluated loans utilizing two different methodologies for the second quarter 2020. Subsequently during the third quarter 2020, Management adopted one methodology. Management used the one systematic methodology to determine its ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company’s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, Management’s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach a different reasonable conclusion. The Company’s ACL recorded in the balance sheet reflects Management’s best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The Company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for Management’s current estimate of expected credit losses. See Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the ACL. See also Note 5-Allowance for Credit Losses and “Provision for Credit Losses” in this MD&A.
Other Real Estate Owned and Bank Property Held For Sale
Other real estate owned (“OREO”) consists of properties obtained through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of loans. Prior to the merger with CSFL, we classified former branch sites as OREO. During the second quarter of 2020 and with the merger with CSFL, the Company elected to reclassify these assets as bank property held for sale and report on a separate line within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Both OREO and bank property held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value and the fair value was determined on the basis of current valuations obtained principally from independent sources, adjusted for estimated selling costs. At the time of foreclosure or initial possession of collateral, for OREO, any excess of the loan balance over the fair value of the real estate held as collateral is treated as a charge against the ACL. At the time a bank property is no longer in service and is moved to held for sale, any excess of the current book value over fair value is recorded as Noninterest Expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Subsequent adjustments to this value are described below in the following paragraph.
We report subsequent declines in the fair value of OREO and bank properties held for sale below the new cost basis through valuation adjustments. Significant judgment and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of these properties, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility. In response to market conditions and other economic factors, Management may utilize liquidation sales as part of its problem asset disposition strategy. As a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of disposition, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from the current valuations used to determine the fair value of these properties. Management reviews the value of these properties periodically and adjusts the values as appropriate. Revenue and expenses from OREO operations, as well as gains or losses on sales and any subsequent adjustments to the value are recorded as OREO Expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Gains or losses on sale of bank properties held for sale, and generally any subsequent write-downs to the value, are recorded as a component in Other Expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed in a business combination. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the balance of goodwill was $1.6 billion. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment for all entities by requiring impairment charges to be based on Step 1 of the previous accounting guidance’s two-step impairment test under ASC Topic 350. Under the new guidance, if a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an entity will record an impairment charge based on that difference. The impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The new standard eliminates the requirement to calculate a goodwill impairment charge using Step 2 which involved calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated impairment. The standard does not change the guidance on completing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. An entity will still be able to perform today’s optional qualitative goodwill impairment assessment before proceeding to the quantitative step of determining whether the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds it fair value. This guidance was effective for the Company as of January 1, 2020.
During the second quarter of 2021, the Company changed its annual goodwill valuation date to October 31 each year in order for the valuation to be closer to our year-end audit date. We evaluated the carrying value of goodwill as of October 31, 2021, our annual test date, considering the effects of COVID-19, and determined that no impairment charge was necessary. Our stock price has historically traded above its book value. However, during the first quarter of 2020, our stock price fell below book value and remained below book value until November 2020. This drop in stock price was mainly in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, which effected stock prices of companies in almost all industries. The lowest trading price for our stock during 2021 was $62.60, which was below year-end book value of $69.27. On December 31, 2021, our stock price closed at $80.11, which is above the book value of $69.27 and tangible book value of $44.62. Based upon our internal valuation and analysis as of October 31, 2021, we determined that no impairment charge was necessary at this time. We will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s business,
operating results, cash flows and financial condition. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues and the economy continues to deteriorate and our stock price falls below current levels, we will have to reevaluate the impact on our financial condition and potential impairment of goodwill.
Core deposit intangibles and client list intangibles consist primarily of amortizing assets established during the acquisition of other banks. This includes whole bank acquisitions and the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities from other financial institutions. Core deposit intangibles represent the estimated value of long-term deposit relationships acquired in these transactions. Client list intangibles represent the value of long-term client relationships for the correspondent banking and wealth and trust management business. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives, such as deposit accounts in the case of core deposit intangible, on a method that we believe reasonably approximates the anticipated benefit stream from this intangible. The estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed for reasonableness.
Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets
Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of the transactions reported in our consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related to differences between the tax basis and accounting basis of certain assets and liabilities, including loans, available for sale securities, ACL, write downs of OREO properties and bank properties held for sale, accumulated depreciation, net operating loss carry forwards, accretion income, deferred compensation, intangible assets, mortgage servicing rights, and post-retirement benefits. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded in situations where it is “more likely than not” that a deferred tax asset is not realizable. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. Additionally, income tax returns are filed by the Company or its subsidiaries in the states of Alabama, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, New York and Virginia and city of New York City. We evaluate the need for income tax reserves related to uncertain income tax positions but had no material reserves at December 31, 2021 or 2020.

Results of Operations
Consolidated net income available to common shareholders increased by $354.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase reflects a decrease in provision for credit losses, an increase in interest income, a decrease in interest expense, and an increase in noninterest income. Partially offsetting these positive effects on net income was an increase in noninterest expense and an increase in the provision for income taxes. The increase in net income was due to the effects from the merger with CSFL in 2020 with the Company having a full year of net interest income and noninterest income from the merger in 2021 along with the Company having a lower amount of merger related expenses in 2021. Another significant impact was related to the releases in the allowance for credit losses in 2021 compared to provision for credit losses in 2020.
Below are key highlights of our results of operations during 2021:
● Consolidated net income available to common shareholders increased 294.2% to $475.5 million in 2021 compared to $120.6 million in 2020, and increased $289.1 million, or 155.0%, from $186.5 million compared to 2019.
o Decreased provision for credit losses of $401.3 million as the Company recorded a release of the allowance for credit losses of $165.3 million in 2021 while in 2020, the Company recorded the provision for credit losses of $236.0 million which included an initial Day 1 provision of $119.0 million on Non-PCD loans and unfunded commitments acquired from CSFL (i.e., the impact of the adoption of CECL on Non-PCD acquired loans) and $117.0 million in provision for credit losses on loans. This provision for credit losses
was the result of forecasted losses that took into consideration the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the overall economic environment and the potential impact on the overall loan portfolio. During 2021, with the continued stabilization in the economy, the Company released some of the allowance for credit losses based on improvements in economic forecasts;
o Increased interest income of $174.8 million, resulting from a $139.3 million increase in interest income from loans and loans held for sale, a $32.9 million increase in interest income from investment securities, and a $2.6 million increase in interest income on federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreement to resell and interest-bearing deposits.
◾ The increase in interest income on loans resulted from a higher non-acquired loan interest income of $115.1 million due to an increase in average balances through organic loan growth and the renewal of acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. The increase in interest income due higher average balance was partially offset by a 12 basis point decline in the yield.
◾ Interest income on acquired loans increased $25.7 million due to a higher average balance from the loans acquired in the merger with CSFL in June 2020, with 2021 having a full year’s effect of the acquired loans. This was partially offset by a 41 basis point decline in the yield on the acquired loan portfolio.
◾ The increase in interest income from investment securities was due to an increase in the average balance in 2021 as the Company strategically invested its excess funds from continued deposit growth, which was partially offset by a decline in the yield of 36 basis points resulting from the ongoing lower interest rate environment;
o Decreased interest expense of $31.9 million due to a 27 basis point decrease in the cost of total interest-bearing liabilities. The decrease in cost of interest-bearing liabilities was due to the continued low interest rate environment along with the reduction in the average balance of higher costing corporate and subordinated debentures and other borrowings.
o Increased noninterest income of $43.1 million was primarily from a $45.3 million increase in correspondent banking and capital markets income, a $21.3 million increase in fees on deposit accounts, a $7.5 million increase in trust and investment services income, and a $7.0 million increase in Bank Owned Life Insurance (“BOLI”) income. These increases were partially offset by a $41.6 million decline in mortgage banking income (See Noninterest Income section on page 63 for further discussion);
o Increased noninterest expense of $150.8 million was primarily from a $135.4 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, a $16.6 million increase in occupancy expense, a $14.6 million increase in information services expense. In addition, with the redemption of the $38.5 million trust preferred securities, the remaining fair value mark of $11.7 million was written off as an extinguishment of debt cost during the second quarter of 2021. These increases were partially offset by a $38.8 million swap termination expense that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2020 along with an $18.7 million decrease in merger and branch consolidation related expense. (See Noninterest Expense section on page 65 for further discussion); and
o Higher income tax provision of $145.4 million due to higher pretax book income in 2021 compared to 2020 along with the recognition of a one-time benefit of $31.5 million recorded in the fourth quarter 2020 related to the ability to carryback tax losses under the CARES Act. The Company recorded pretax book income of $604.3 million in 2021 compared to pretax income of $104.0 million in 2020.
● Basic earnings per common share increased 207.3% to $6.76 in 2021, from $2.20 in 2020 and increased 25.2% from $5.40 in 2019.
● Diluted earnings per common share increased 206.4% to $6.71 in 2021, from $2.19 in 2020, and increased 25.2% from $5.36 in 2019.
● Return on average assets was 1.19% in 2021, compared to 0.42% in 2020 and to 1.21% in 2019. The increase in 2021 compared to 2020 was driven by the growth in net income of 294.2%, or $354.9 million, to $475.5 million being greater than the increase in total average assets of 39.1%, or $11.3 billion, to $40.0 billion in 2021. As mentioned previously, the growth in net income as well as the increase in average assets was mainly related to the full year impact from the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020. The increase in net income was also due to the reversals of provision for credit losses in 2021 as economic forecasts improved
related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in 2020 compared to 2019 was driven by the increase in total average assets of 86.4%, or $13.3 billion, to $28.8 billion in 2020 due to the merger with CSFL, as well as a decline in net income of 35.3%, or $65.9 million, to $120.6 million in 2020.
● Return on average common shareholders’ equity increased to 10.01% in 2021, compared to 3.35% in 2020, and 7.89% in 2019. The increase in 2021 compared to 2020 was driven by the greater growth in net income of 294.2%, or $354.9 million, to $475.5 million compared to an increase in average common shareholders’ equity of 31.72%, or $1.1 billion, in 2021. As mentioned above, the increase in net income was mainly due to a full year’s impact from the merger with CSFL along with the reversals of provision for credit losses in 2021 related to improved economic forecasts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in 2020 compared to 2019, was driven by both an increase in average common shareholders’ equity of 52.5%, or $1.2 billion, and a decline in net income of 35.3%, or $65.9 million, in 2020. The increase in average equity was due to the equity issued in the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020 and the decline in net income was mainly due to the Day 1 provision for credit losses and expenses related to the merger with CSFL.
● Our dividend payout ratio was 28.43% for 2021 compared with 81.45% in 2020 and 30.94% in 2019. The decrease in the dividend payout ratio in 2021 compared to 2020 was due to the growth in net income available to common shareholders, which increased 294.2%, being greater than the increase in dividends paid of 37.7%, or $37.1 million. The increase in net income in 2021 was mainly due to lower net income in 2020 attributable to the Day 1 provision for credit losses from the CSFL merger, higher provision for credit losses due the COVID-19 pandemic and expenses related to the merger with CSFL. The increase in the dividends paid was due to the increase in average outstanding shares from the merger with CSFL for a full year in addition to the Company increasing the cash dividend per share from $0.47 to $0.49 starting in the third quarter of 2021. The increase in the dividend payout ratio in 2020 compared to 2019, was due to the increase in dividends paid of 70.3%, or $40.6 million as well as the decline in net income available to common shareholders, which decreased 35.3%. The increase in the dividends paid was due the increase in outstanding shares from the merger with CSFL and the decline in net income was mainly due to the Day 1 provision for credit losses and expenses related to the merger with CSFL.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income is the largest component of our net income. Net interest income is the difference between income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is determined by the yields earned on interest-earning assets, rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, the relative balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the degree of mismatch, and the maturity and repricing characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets represents our net interest margin.
During 2019, the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee’s target for federal funds target rate remained at the 2.25% to 2.50% range until July 2019 when the Federal Reserve began to drop the federal funds target rate. In the last half of 2019, the Federal Reserve dropped the federal funds target rate 75 basis points to the range of 1.50% to 1.75% at December 31, 2019. The Federal Reserve then dropped the federal funds target rate 150 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% in March 2020 in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. This drop in interest rates in 2019 and 2020 continued to affect both our net interest income and net interest margin for the year ended 2021. The yield on interest-earning assets declined 54 basis points in 2021 compared to 2020 and by 83 basis points in 2020 compared to 2019. The yield on our acquired loan portfolio decreased 41 basis points in 2021 from 2020 after a decrease of 147 basis point in 2020 from 2019 and the yield on our non-acquired loan portfolio decreased of 12 basis points in 2021 from 2020 after a decrease of 38 basis points in 2020 from 2019. These declines in yields on earning assets were the main drivers in the net interest margin declining 36 basis points in 2021 compared to 2020 and 51 basis points in 2020 compared to 2019.
We have also continued focusing on increasing core deposits (excluding certificates of deposits and other time deposits). The core deposits grew primarily due to the federal government pushing funds into the market through stimulus programs, in addition to consumers remaining conservative in their spending habits in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. These funds are normally lower cost funds. As a result, the cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased 21 basis points in 2021 after decreasing 40 basis points in 2020. The overall cost on all interest-bearing liabilities declined in 2021 compared to 2020 by 27 basis points. The decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities has had a positive effect on our net interest income and net interest margin for 2021, however, the negative effect on the yield on interest earning assets has been greater.
2021 compared to 2020
Net interest income and net interest margin highlighted for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020:
● Our net interest income increased by $206.8 million, or 25.0%, to $1.0 billion during 2021, compared to 2020, as interest income increased $174.8 million and interest expense declined $31.9 million.
o Our interest income increased by $174.8 million due to -
◾ Higher non-acquired loan interest income of $115.1 million due to a higher average balance of $3.4 billion, higher investment securities interest income of $32.9 million because of higher average balances of $2.9 billion, acquired loan interest income increasing by $25.7 million because of higher average balances in acquired loans of $1.4 billion, and higher federal funds sold and repurchase agreements interest income of $2.6 million because of higher average balances of $2.8 billion.
◾ These increases in interest income were partially offset by lower interest income of $1.5 million on loans held for sale due to lower average balances of $54.3 million.
◾ The effects from the increases in the average balance of interest-earning assets have outweighed the effects of the declines in average yields in 2021.
o Average interest-earning assets increased $10.3 billion, or 40.6%, to $35.8 billion in 2021, compared to 2020. The increase in the average balance on the non-acquired loan portfolio of $3.4 billion was due to organic growth and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. The increase in the average balance on the acquired loan portfolio of $1.4 billion was due to the loans acquired from the merger with CSFL being only outstanding 207 days in 2020. Although the acquired loan portfolio increased from 2020, it has declined throughout 2021 due to paydowns, pay-offs and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. The increase in the average balance in investment securities of $2.9 billion was a result of the Company’s decision to strategically increase the investment portfolio due to the excess liquidity from deposit growth.
o Overall, our yield on interest-earning assets in 2021 declined 54 basis points from 2020, due to the falling interest rate environment resulting from the drops in the federal funds rate made by the Federal Reserve in March 2020. The yield on the non-acquired loan portfolio decreased 12 basis points, the acquired loan portfolio yield declined 41 basis points, the yield on investment securities dropped by 36 basis points, and on the yield on federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell and interest-bearing deposits decreased by 3 basis points. The yield on loans held for sale remained flat. The yield on interest-earning assets also declined as the average balance of lower yielding federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell, interest-bearing deposits and investment securities increased as a percentage of total interest-earning assets from 22.8% to 31.9%.
o Our interest expense declined by of $31.9 million in 2021 compared to 2020 due to -
◾ Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits declining $22.3 million because of a reduction in the average cost of 21 basis points, interest expense related to other borrowings declined $8.9 million because of a lower average balance of $662.6 million, and the interest expense on repurchase agreements declined $790,000 because of a decrease in the average cost of 27 basis points.
◾ The effects from the declines in average cost of interest-bearing liabilities have outweighed the effects of the increases in average balance in 2021.
o Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $6.2 billion, or 36.1%, to $23.2 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 mainly due the acquired interest-bearing liabilities from the merger with CSFL only outstanding for 207 days in 2020. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $6.5 billion, the average balance of federal funds purchased increased $259.7 million and repurchase agreements increased $65.1 million. The average balance on other borrowing decreased $662.6 million. Within other borrowings, the average balance on corporate and subordinated debentures increased $81.4 million as the Company assumed $271.5 million in borrowings in the merger with CSFL. The increase related to the merger was partially offset by the Company’s redemption of $63.5 million of subordinated debentures and trust preferred securities assumed from the CSFL merger in June 2021. The average balance of FHLB and FRB borrowings decreased $744.0 million due to the Company’s strategic decision to payoff $700.0 million of
FHLB advances (along with the termination of interest rate hedges on these borrowings) in the fourth quarter of 2020.
o The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities in 2021 compared to 2020 decreased 27 basis points. This decrease occurred in all categories of funding, except for other borrowings which increased 229 basis points in 2021. The primary cause for the lower cost on interest-bearing deposits of 21 basis points, federal funds purchased of 8 basis points and repurchase agreements of 27 basis points was the continued low interest rate environment. The cause for the increase in cost on other borrowings in 2021 is due to having a full year’s impact from the higher cost subordinated debt assumed in the CSFL merger along with the effects of paying off the lower cost FHLB and FRB borrowings (along with the termination of the interest rate hedges on these borrowing) in the fourth quarter of 2020.
● Both the non-tax equivalent and the tax equivalent net interest margin decreased by 36 basis points in 2021 compared to 2020 due to the decline in the yield on interest earning assets of 54 basis points, which was only partially offset by a decrease in cost of interest-bearing liabilities of 27 basis points.
2020 compared to 2019
Net interest income and net interest margin highlighted for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019:
● Our net interest income increased by $322.2 million, or 63.9%, to $826.5 million during 2020, compared to 2019, as interest income increased $319.2 million and interest expense declined $3.0 million.
● Our interest income increased by $319.2 million with acquired loan interest income increasing by $258.8 million because of higher average balances of acquired loans of $6.1 billion, higher non-acquired loan interest income of $51.0 million due to a higher average balance of $2.1 billion, higher investment securities interest income of $8.5 million because of higher average balances of $1.2 billion and higher interest income of $6.6 million on loans held for sale due to higher average balances of $250.4 million. These increases in interest income were partially offset by a $5.7 million decline in federal funds sold and repurchase agreements interest income as the yield declined by 191 basis points, offsetting the effects of the average balance increasing by $2.4 billion. The effects from the increases in average balance of interest-earning assets have outweighed the effects of the declines in average yields in 2020.
● Average interest-earning assets increased $12.0 billion, or 89.8%, to $25.5 billion in 2020, compared to 2019 mainly due to the merger with CSFL. The average balance of our acquired loans portfolio increased by $6.1 billion as the Company acquired $13.0 billion in loans from the merger with CSFL in June 2020. The average balance of our non-acquired loan portfolio increased $2.1 billion because of organic growth. In addition, the average balance of federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell and interest-bearing deposits increased $2.4 billion and the average balance of investment securities increased $1.2 billion, as we acquired $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.2 billion in investment securities in the merger with CSFL. The increase in the average balance of loans held for sale was due to both the increase in volume from the merger with CSFL along with additional mortgage volume resulting from the decrease in interest rates in 2020.
● Overall, our yield on interest-earning assets in 2020 decreased 83 basis points from 2019, due to a falling interest rate environment as the Federal Reserve dropped the federal funds target rate by 75 basis points from July 2019 to October 2019 and then dropped the federal funds target rate 150 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The yield on the non-acquired loan portfolio declined 38 basis points, on the acquired loan portfolio of 147 basis points, on the investment securities by 81 basis points, on federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell and interest-bearing deposits of 191 basis points and loans held for sale by 97 basis points.
● Our interest expense decreased by $3.0 million in 2020 compared to 2019 with interest expense on interest-bearing deposits declining $10.5 million because of a lower average cost of 40 basis points and with interest expense on federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements declining $677,000 because of a lower average cost of 58 basis points. These declines in interest expense were partially offset by an increase interest expense from borrowings of $8.2 million because of a higher average balance of $362.7 million, mainly due to the assumption of borrowings from the merger with CSFL. The effects from the declines in average cost of interest-bearing liabilities have outweighed the effects of the increases in average balance in 2020.
● Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $7.5 billion, or 77.9%, to $17.1 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 mainly due to the merger with CSFL. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $6.8 billion as the Company acquired $10.3 billion in interest-bearing deposits from the merger with CSFL in June 2020. The average balance of federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements increased $270.9 million as the Company acquired $401.5 million in federal funds purchased and repurchase agreement from the merger with CSFL. The average balance of borrowings increased $362.7 million as the Company assumed $271.5 million in borrowings from the merger with CSFL along with the average balance of FHLB Advances held during 2020 being higher by $175.8 million in 2020 compared to 2019.
● The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities in 2020 compared to 2019 decreased 41 basis points. This decrease occurred in all categories of funding and was due to the falling interest rate environment in the last half of 2019 and in 2020. The average cost on interest bearing deposits declined 40 basis points, federal funds purchased and repurchase agreement declined 58 basis points and borrowing declined 18 basis points. The decline in the average cost of borrowing due to the decline in interest rates was partially offset by the higher average cost on the subordinated debentures assumed in the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020 along with the rising costs of the cash flow hedges on $700 million of FHLB advances held during most of 2020. The $700 million in FHLB advances and the cash flow hedges tied to these advances were paid-off and terminated in the fourth quarter of 2020.
● Both the non-tax equivalent and the tax equivalent net interest margin decreased by 51 basis points 2020 compared to 2019 due to the decline in the yield on interest earning assets of 83 basis points, which was only partially offset by the lower cost of interest-bearing liabilities of 41 basis points. Our interest-earning assets have repriced more quickly than our interest-bearing liabilities as rates have fallen in the last half of 2019 and in 2020 causing the net interest margin to decline.

Noninterest Income and Expense
Noninterest income provides us with additional revenues that are significant sources of income. In 2021, 2020, and 2019, noninterest income comprised 25.5%, 27.4%, and 22.2%, respectively, of total net interest income and noninterest income. Note that recoveries on acquired loans were no longer recorded through the income statement beginning in 2020 with the adoption of CECL. These recoveries are now recorded through the allowance for credit losses on the balance sheet.
Table 3-Noninterest Income for the Three Years
2021 compared to 2020
Our noninterest income increased 13.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. This change in total noninterest income resulted from the following:
● Service charges on deposit accounts were higher in 2021 by $10.3 million, or 18.5%, compared to 2020, due primarily to the increase in customers and activity in 2021 through the merger with CSFL completed during the second quarter of 2020. Year-to-date 2020 only included CSFL activity from June 8, 2020 through December 31, 2020. The increase in service charges on deposit accounts was mainly driven by an increase in service charge maintenance fees on checking and savings accounts, in net non-sufficient funds and overdraft protection fee income, in fees related to wire transfers and in commissions from sales of checks.
● Debit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income was higher by $11.0 million, or 38.5%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in debit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income was mainly driven by higher debit card, credit card sales incentive, and ATM and merchant card income due to the increase in activity related to the merger with CSFL completed in the second quarter of 2020. Year-to-date 2020 only included CSFL activity from June 8, 2020 through December 31, 2020.
● Mortgage banking income decreased by $41.6 million, or 39.2%, which was comprised of $42.2 million, or 41.2%, decrease from mortgage income in the secondary market, partially offset by a $578,000, or 15.5%, increase from mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge. During 2021, mortgage income from the secondary market comprised of a $8.9 million decline in the change in fair value of the pipeline, loans held for sale and MBS forward trades and a $33.3 million decrease in the net gain on sale of mortgage loans. Net gains on the sale of mortgage loans was $75.1 million in 2021, which is net of the commission expense related to mortgage production of $27.2 million. During the second quarter of 2021, the Company began allocating a lower percentage of its mortgage production and pipeline to the secondary market compared to 2020, which resulted in lower mortgage income from the secondary market. This change was mainly due to the increase in liquidity held at the Bank along with the reduction in the gain on sale margin in 2021 compared to 2020. The allocation of mortgage production between portfolio and secondary market depends on the Company’s liquidity, market spreads and rate changes during each period and will fluctuate quarter to quarter. The increase in mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge during 2021 was due to a $4.4 million increase from servicing fee income, which was partially offset by a $3.8 million decrease in the change in fair value of the MSR including decay. The decrease in fair value of the MSR is due to an increase in MSR decay of $6.1 million and losses on the MSR hedge of $15.1 million, partially offset by an increase in the change in fair value from interest rates of $17.4 million compared to the 2020. The increase in the servicing fee income is due to the increase in size of the servicing portfolio during 2021.
● Trust and investment services income increased $7.5 million, or 25.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in business through the merger with CSFL which was completed in the second quarter of 2020 resulted in the increase in income. Also, assets under management have increased $902.0 million or 17.4% from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021.
● Correspondent banking and capital markets income for 2021 increased by $45.3 million from 2020. Year-to-date 2020 only included CSFL correspondent banking activity from June 8, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Also, the acquisition of Duncan-Williams on February 1, 2021 contributed to the increase in correspondent banking and capital markets income during 2021. The income from this business includes commissions earned on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities.
● Bank owned life insurance income increased $7.0 million, or 61.8%, in 2021 compared to 2020. This increase was due to an increase in the cash surrender value of $8.0 million which resulted from the $333.1 million of bank owned life insurance acquired in the merger with CSFL during the second quarter of 2020, along with the purchase of $205.6 million of policies in April 2021. This increase was partially offset by a $1.0 million decline in income resulting from the payout of insurance policies.
● Other income increased by $3.5 million due to the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020. This increase was mainly due to increases in SBA loan servicing fees and gains on sale of SBA loans of $6.1 million. The Company has also seen an increase in Small Business Investment Company (“SBIC”) investment income of $2.1 million during 2021 as the Company has increased its SBIC investment portfolio during 2020
and 2021. These increases were partially offset by $3.6 million in income recorded in 2020 related to the credit valuation adjustment on the Company’s back-to-back interest rate swaps.
2020 compared to 2019
Our noninterest income increased 116.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 resulting primarily from the merger with CSFL in June of 2020. In addition, the following was also noted:
● Service charges on deposit accounts and debit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income was higher in 2020 by $8.9 million than in 2019, due primarily to the increase in customers and activity through the merger with CSFL during the second quarter of 2020. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $3.7 million which was mainly attributable to an increase in service charge maintenance fees on checking accounts. Debit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income increased $5.1 million and was mainly attributable to an increase in debit card income.
● Mortgage banking income increased by $88.6 million, or 504.7%, which was comprised of $85.2 million, or 491.8%, increase from mortgage income in the secondary market, and a $3.5 million, or 1389.3%, increase from mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge. These increases were directly attributable to the increase in volume resulting from the low interest rate environment brought on by the pandemic and monetary policy of the US Government during 2020 along with the increase in volume due to the merger with CSFL. The increase in mortgage income from the secondary market in 2020 was due to a $93.1 million increase in the gain on sale of mortgage loans net of the cost related to mortgage production. This increase was offset by a $8.0 million decline in the change in fair value of the pipeline, loans held for sale and MBS forward trades. The increase in mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge in 2020 was due to a $1.9 million increase in servicing fee income along with a $1.6 million increase in the change in fair value of the MSR including decay.
● The merger with CSFL resulted in a significant increase in correspondent banking and capital markets income. The income for 2020 increased by $61.9 million, or 2138.7%. The income from this business includes commissions earned on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities.
● Bank owned life insurance (“BOLI”) income is now reported separately (not included in Other Income) in the table above and increased by $5.6 million, or 97.6%, due to the merger with CSFL. Total BOLI increased to $559.4 million at December 31, 2020 as the Company acquired $333.1 million in BOLI through the merger with CSFL in 2020.
● Recoveries on acquired loans declined by $6.8 million, given these are no longer recorded through the income statement, but through the balance sheet as a result of the adoption of CECL.
● Securities gains, net, declined by $2.7 million compared to 2020. During 2019, securities gains were mainly a result of selling VISA Class B shares at a gain of $5.4 million partially offset by net realized losses of $2.7 million on lower yielding securities that were sold during the year.
● Other income increased by $11.9 million primarily from income related to the merger with CSFL. Two of the largest categories were from the servicing and sale of SBA loans, which increased $5.7 million, and from an increase in rental income of $1.4 million.
Noninterest expense represents the largest expense category for our company. During 2021 and 2020, we continued to emphasize careful controls around our noninterest expense. With that, our expenses in 2021 increased $150.8 million or 18.9% from 2020, mainly due to the merger with CSFL. Noninterest expense increased $393.0 million or 97.1% in 2020 from 2019.
Table 4-Noninterest Expense for the Three Years
2021 compared to 2020
Noninterest expense increased $150.8 million, or 18.9% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. This increase was mainly due to 2021 having a full year’s effect from the merger with CSFL while 2020 was only partially affected from the merger date of June 7, 2020. The change in total noninterest expense resulted from the following:
● Salary and employee benefits increased by $135.4 million, or 32.5%, as all categories of salaries and benefits expense increased due to the merger with CSFL. Salaries increased $66.9 million, benefits increased $11.4 million, commissions increased $32.5 million, and incentives increased $24.6 million. With the merger with CSFL in June 2020, the Company added approximately 2,800 employees, almost doubling its total employees.
● In the fourth quarter of 2020, the company terminated three cash flow hedges (SWAPs) given the current low interest rate environment and expectation of low interest rates in the foreseeable future resulting in a termination cost of $38.8 million.
● Merger and branch consolidation related expense decreased $18.7 million, or 21.7% in 2021 compared to 2020. Merger and branch consolidation expense of $64.4 million in 2021 and $83.0 million in 2020 was related primarily to the merger with CSFL.
● The Company had extinguishment of debt cost of $11.7 million in 2021. This cost was from the write-off of the fair market value adjustment recorded on the trust preferred securities assumed in the CSFL merger. All of the trust preferred securities assumed in the CSFL merger were redeemed in June 2021.
● Information services expense and occupancy expense increased $14.6 million, or 24.4% and $16.6 million, or 22.0%, respectively. These increases were related to the additional cost associated with facilities, employees and systems added through our merger with CSFL as our number of branches increased by 129 during 2020 to 285 at December 31, 2020. The number of branches declined slightly in 2021 to 281.
● Amortization of intangibles increased $8.2 million, or 30.4%. This increase was due to the merger with CSFL, which resulted in the Company recording a core deposit intangible asset of $125.9 million and a correspondent banking customer intangible asset of $10.0 million in June of 2020.
● FDIC assessment and other regulatory charges increased $7.3 million, or 67.9%. This increase was due to an increase in FDIC assessments and OCC examination fees resulting from the merger with CSFL and the growth since the merger, in addition to new regulatory charges attributable to Duncan-Williams.
● Business development and staff related expense increased $6.6 million, or 64.7% due mainly to the merger with CSFL with the increase in employees. The increase was also due to limited expense in 2020 attributable to the initial impact from the COVID-19 pandemic before vaccines were available.
● Other noninterest expense increased by $8.0 million, or 18.6%. This increase was mainly due to a general increase in expenses due to the merger with CSFL including loan expenses, insurance expense, donations, various operational reserves, and operating charge-offs. There was also an increase of $2.8 million in cost associated with the Association Banking Prime Earnings Credit Program in 2021 from 2020.
2020 compared to 2019
Noninterest expense increased $393.0 million, or 97.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 resulting primarily the merger with CSFL in June 2020. Below includes additional discussion:
● Salary and employee benefits increased by $181.9 million, or 77.5%, as all categories of salaries and benefits expense increased due to the merger with CSFL. With the merger, the number of full-time equivalent employees increased 103.5% from 2,547 at December 31, 2019 to 5,184 at December 31, 2020.
● In the fourth quarter of 2020, the company terminated three cash flow hedges (SWAPs) given the current low interest rate environment and expectation of low interest rates in the foreseeable future resulting in a termination cost of $38.8 million.
● Merger and branch consolidation related expense increased $81.4 million, or 1787.2%. This increase was related primarily to the merger with CSFL and includes cost both before and after the merger, including professional fees, severance, contract terminations, branch consolidations, fixed assets written off and other related cost. The costs in 2019 were mainly related to the consolidation of 13 branches during the year.
● Information services expense increased $24.4 million, or 68.7%. This increase was related to the additional cost associated with facilities, employees and systems added through our merger with CSFL. Our number of branches increased by 129, or 83.2% from 155 at December 31, 2019 to 285 at December 31, 2020.
● Occupancy expense increased $28.1 million, or 59.3%. This increase was related to the additional cost associated with facilities added resulting from our merger with CSFL. Our number of branches increased by 129, or 83.2% from 155 at December 31, 2019 to 285 at December 31, 2020.
● Amortization of intangibles increased $13.9 million, or 106.3%. This increase was due to the merger with CSFL which resulted in the Company recording a core deposit intangible asset of $125.9 million and a correspondent banking customer intangible asset of $10.0 million in 2020.
● FDIC assessment and other regulatory charges increased $6.2 million, or 135.7%. This increase was mainly due to the addition of assets and liabilities acquired through our merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020.
● In 2019, the Company recorded a pension plan termination expense of $9.5 million related to the termination of our pension plan. This resulted in the recognition of the losses from the pension plan that were being held in accumulated other comprehensive income of $7.7 million and the write-off of the pension plan asset of $1.8 million.
● Other noninterest expense increased by $20.6 million, or 93.2%. This increase was mainly due to a general increase in expenses due to the merger with CSFL including loan expenses, insurance expense, donations, various operational reserves, miscellaneous taxes and miscellaneous operating charge-offs. There was also a $6.5 million increase in passive losses recorded in 2020 related to tax credit partnerships. We added approximately $29 million more in these CRA investments in 2020, of which $13.8 million were acquired through the merger with CSFL. We added approximately $39 million of CRA investments in 2019.
Income Tax Expense
Our effective tax rate increased to 21.30% at December 31, 2021 compared to (16.02%) for the year-ended December 31, 2020. When excluding the tax loss carryback and other discrete items, the effective tax rate for the year-ended December 31, 2020 was 14.24%. The increase was mainly due to increased pre-tax book income, offset by an increase in tax-exempt income and federal tax credits available. For additional information refer to Note 12-income
Taxes in the consolidated financial statements.
Financial Condition
Overview
At December 31, 2021, we had total assets of approximately $42.0 billion, consisting principally of $23.6 billion in net loans ($16.1 billion in non-acquired loans, $5.9 billion in acquired non-credit deteriorated loans, $2.0 billion in acquired credit deteriorated loans, net of $301.8 million allowance for credit losses), $7.2 billion in investment securities and $6.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Our liabilities at December 31, 2021 totaled $37.2 billion, consisting principally of deposits of $35.1 billion ($11.5 billion in noninterest-bearing and $23.6 billion in interest-bearing) and short-term and long-term borrowings of $1.1 billion. At December 31, 2021, our shareholders’ equity was $4.8 billion.
At December 31, 2020, we had total assets of approximately $37.8 billion, consisting principally of $24.2 billion in net loans ($12.3 billion in non-acquired loans, $9.5 billion in acquired non-credit impaired loans, $2.9 billion in acquired credit impaired loans, net of $457.3 million allowance for credit losses, $4.4 billion in investment securities and $4.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Our liabilities at December 31, 2020 totaled $33.1 billion, consisting principally of deposits of $30.7 billion ($9.7 billion in noninterest-bearing and $21.0 in interest-bearing) and short-term and long-term borrowings of $1.2 billion. At December 31, 2020, our shareholders’ equity was $4.6 billion.
Book value per common share was $69.27 at the end of 2021, an increase from $65.49 at the end of 2020. Book value per common share increased in 2021 as shareholder equity increased by 3.3% while common shares outstanding declined by 2.3%. The primary reason for an increase in shareholder’s equity of $155.0 million during 2021 was due to net income of $475.5 million. This increase was partially offset by declines in equity resulting from $135.2 million in dividends paid to shareholders, $146.4 million in common stock repurchased on the open market and $68.9 million reduction in AOCI related to unrealized losses on available for sale securities. The primary reason for the decline in common shares outstanding of 1.6 million was due to the Company repurchasing 1.8 million shares on the open market in 2021.
Our common equity to assets ratio decreased to 11.45% in 2021, compared with 12.30% in 2020. The decrease in 2021, compared to 2020, was the result of the percentage increase in total assets of 11.0% being greater than the percentage increase in shareholders’ equity of 3.3%. The increase in total assets was mainly due to the increase in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities as our liquidity has increased through the growth in deposits.
Trading Securities
We have a trading portfolio associated with our Correspondent Bank Division, that was inherited through the acquisitions of CSFL in June 2020 and Duncan Williams in February 2021. For this portfolio, realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in trading securities revenue, a component of Correspondent Banking and Capital Market Income in our “Consolidated Statements of Income”. Securities purchased for this portfolio have primarily been municipal, treasuries and mortgage-backed agency securities and are held for short periods of time and totaled $77.7 million and $10.7 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Investment Securities
We use investment securities, the second largest category of interest earning assets, to generate interest income through the employment of excess funds, to provide liquidity, to fund loan demand or deposit liquidation, and to pledge as collateral for public funds deposits, repurchase agreements and as collateral for derivative exposure. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, investment securities totaled $7.2 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, average investment securities were $5.7 billion, or 16.1% of average earning assets, compared with $2.9 billion, or 11.4% of average earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2020. The expected average life of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2021 was approximately 6.27 years, compared with 4.35 years at December 31, 2020. See Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the audited consolidated financial statements for our accounting policy on investment securities.
As securities are purchased, they are designated as held to maturity or available for sale based upon our intent, which considers liquidity needs, interest rate expectations, asset/liability management strategies, and capital requirements.
The following table presents the reported values of investment securities for the past two years:
Table 5-Values of Investment Securities
During 2021, our total investment securities increased $2.7 billion, or 61.3%, from December 31, 2020. During 2021, we purchased $3.9 billion of securities, $975.3 million classified as held to maturity and $2.9 billion classified as available for sale. We continue to increase our investment securities strategically primarily with excess funds due to deposit growth and excess liquidity. These purchases were partially offset by maturities, paydowns, sales and calls of investment securities totaling $1.1 billion. Net amortization of premiums were $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
At December 31, 2021, the unrealized net loss of the available for sale investment securities portfolio was $27.8 million, or 0.5%, below its amortized cost basis. Comparable valuations at December 31, 2020 reflected an unrealized net gain of the available for sale investment portfolio of $62.6 million, or 1.9%, above its amortized cost basis. The decrease in fair value in the available for sale investment portfolio at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 was mainly due to the increase in short and long term interest rates during 2021. At December 31, 2021, the unrealized net loss of the held to maturity investment securities portfolio was $41.8 million, or 2.3%, below its amortized cost basis. At December 31, 2020, the unrealized net gain of the held to maturity investment securities portfolio was $1.6 million, or 0.2%, above its amortized cost basis.
Table 6-Credit Ratings of Investment Securities
*
Agency mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), agency collateralized mortgage-obligations (CMO) and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) are guaranteed by the issuing government-sponsored enterprise (“GSE”) as to the timely payments of principal and interest. Except for Government National Mortgage Association securities, which have the full faith and credit backing of the United States Government, the GSE alone is responsible for making payments on this guaranty. While the rating agencies have not rated any of the MBS, CMO and CMBS issued, senior debt securities issued by GSEs are rated consistently as “Triple-A.” Most market participants consider agency MBS, CMOs and CMBSs as carrying an implied Aaa rating (S&P rating of AA+) because of the guarantees of timely payments and selection criteria of mortgages backing the securities. We do not own any private label mortgage-backed securities. The balances presented under the ratings above reflect the amortized cost of the investment securities.
Held to maturity
As described above the Company elected to classify some of its securities purchased during 2021 and 2020 as held to maturity. These are securities that the Company does not intend to sell and expects to hold to maturity. The securities consist of $112.9 million of agency securities and $1.6 billion of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S government agencies or sponsored enterprises and $62.6 million of Small Business Administration loan-backed securities. The following are highlights of our held to maturity portfolio:
● Total held to maturity portfolio totaled $1.8 billion.
● The balance of securities held to maturity represented 4.3% of total assets at December 31, 2021.
● We purchased $975.3 million of held to maturity investment securities in 2021, partially offset by maturities, calls and paydowns totaling $105.0 million in 2021.
Available for sale
Securities available for sale consist mainly of debentures of government sponsored entities, state and municipal bonds, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S government agencies or sponsored enterprises and Small Business Administration loan-backed securities. At December 31, 2021, investment securities with both a fair value and amortized cost of $5.2 billion, were classified as available for sale. The adjustment for net unrealized losses of $27.8 million between the carrying value of these securities and their amortized cost has been reflected, net of tax, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. The following are highlights of our available for sale securities:
● Total securities available for sale increased $1.9 billion, or 55.9%, from the balance at December 31, 2020. The unrealized gain/loss position on the investment portfolio decreased $90.5 million and net amortization of premiums was $32.1 million during 2021. We purchased $2.9 billion of available for sale investment securities in 2021, partially offset by maturities, calls and paydowns totaling $805.3 million and sales totaling $151.3 million in 2021. The sales in 2021 were mainly related to restructuring our portfolio to fit our investment strategy and risk profile.
● The balance of securities available for sale represented 12.4% of total assets at December 31, 2021 and 8.8% of total assets at December 31, 2020.
● Interest income earned on all investment securities in 2021 was $87.6 million, an increase of $32.9 million, or 60.3%, from $54.6 million in 2020. The increase was due to a $2.9 billion increase in average balances which was partially offset by a reduction in the yield on investment securities. The yield on investment securities declined 36 basis points during 2021, to 1.52%. In 2021, we used a portion of our excess liquidity from deposit growth to increase the size of our investment portfolio, and the 2021 purchases had lower yields compared to the existing portfolio resulting in a decrease in the overall yield of our investment portfolio.
At December 31, 2021, we had 296 investment securities (including both available for sale and held to maturity) in an unrealized loss position, which totaled $106.0 million. See Note 3-Investment Securities in the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The increase in the number of securities in a loss position and the relative percentage of loss to portfolio size was primarily a result of the increase in short and long-term interest rates during 2021.
Management evaluates securities for impairment where there has been a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of a security to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with the decline in fair value on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. Credit losses are calculated individually, rather than collectively, using a discounted cash flow method, whereby Management compares the present value of expected cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the security. The credit loss component would be recognized through the provision for credit losses. Consideration is given to (1) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer including looking at default and delinquency rates, (2) the outlook for receiving the contractual cash flows of the investments, (3) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (4) our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value or for a debt security whether it is more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the debt security prior to recovering its fair value, (5) the anticipated outlook for changes in the general level of interest rates, (6) credit ratings, (7) third-party guarantees, and (8) collateral values. In analyzing an issuer’s financial condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, the results of reviews of the issuer’s financial condition, and the issuer’s anticipated ability to pay the contractual cash flows of the investments. The Company performed an analysis that determined that the following securities have a zero expected credit loss: U.S. Treasury Securities, Agency-Backed Securities including securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, FHLB, FFCB and SBA. All of the U.S. Treasury and Agency-Backed Securities have the full faith and credit backing of the United States Government or one of its agencies. Municipal securities and all other securities that do not have a zero expected credit loss are evaluated quarterly to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with a decline in fair value. All debt securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2021 continue to perform as scheduled and we do not believe there is a credit loss or a provision for credit losses is necessary.
Also, as part of our evaluation of our intent and ability to hold investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market, we consider our investment strategy, cash flow needs, liquidity position, capital adequacy and interest rate risk position. We do not currently intend to sell the securities within the portfolio and it is not more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the debt securities. See Note 1-Summary of Significant Account Policies for further discussion.
Other Investments
Our other investment securities consist of non-marketable equity securities that have no readily determinable market value. Accordingly, when evaluating these securities for impairment, Management considers the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than recognizing temporary declines in value. As of December 31, 2021, we determined that there was no impairment on our other investment securities. As of December 31, 2021, other investment securities represented approximately $160.6 million, or 0.38% of total assets and primarily consisted of FRB and FHLB stock which totals $129.7 million and $16.3 million, respectively. There were no gains or losses on the sales of these securities during 2021 or 2020.

Loan Portfolio
Our loan portfolio remains our largest category of interest-earning assets. At December 31, 2021, total loans, excluding held for sale loans, were $23.9 billion, which was an overall decrease of $736.0 million, or 3.0%, from the balance at the end of 2020. Non-acquired loan growth was $3.8 billion, or 30.6% for 2021, which was made up of a 21.5% increase in consumer real estate loans, a 55.0% increase in non-owner occupied real estate loans (including construction and land development loans), a 36.9% increase in commercial owner occupied real estate loans, a 5.4% increase in commercial and industrial loans, a 31.4% increase in other income producing property and a 16.9% increase in consumer non real estate loans. The increases in non-acquired loans were due to organic growth and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. Total acquired loans decreased by $4.5 billion. The decreases in acquired loans were due to principal payments, charge offs, foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans that were moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio.
Acquired loans as a percentage of total loans decreased to 32.9% at December 31, 2021 compared to 50.2% at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, non-acquired loans as a percentage of the overall portfolio were 67.1% compared to 49.8% at December 31, 2020. Average total loans outstanding during 2021 were $24.1 billion, increasing $4.7 billion, or 24.5%, over the 2020 average of $19.4 billion. (For further discussion of the Company’s acquired loan accounting, see Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 2-Mergers and Acquisitions, Note 4-Loans and Note 5-Allowance for Credit Losses in the consolidated financial statements.)
The following table presents a summary of the loan portfolio by category (excludes loans held for sale):
Table 8-Distribution of Loans by Type
(1) Includes $180.4 million and $495.6 million of construction and land development loans at December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
(2) Includes loans on both 1-4 family owner occupied property, as well as loans collateralized by 1-4 family owner occupied property with a business intent.
(3) Includes $59.7 million and $115.1 million of construction and land development loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
(4) Includes $1.8 billion and $1.3 billion of construction and land development loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The following highlights of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020:
● Non-acquired loans were $16.1 billion, or 67.1% of total loans and acquired loans were $7.9 billion, or 32.9% of total loans at December 31, 2021. This compared to non-acquired loans of $12.3 billion, or 49.8% and acquired loans of $12.4 billion, or 50.2% at December 31, 2020. The increase in non-acquired loans of $3.8 billion was due to organic growth and renewals of acquired loans that were moved to the non-acquired loan portfolio. This increase was net of a reduction in non-acquired PPP loans of $729.0 million in 2021 through pay-off and loan forgiveness. Therefore, excluding PPP loan activity, non-acquired loans increased $4.5 billion. Total acquired loans declined by $4.5 billion, as compared to the same period in 2020. The decrease in acquired loans was due to principal payments, charge offs, foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans that were moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. The decline also included a reduction of acquired PPP loans of $959.8 million through pay-off and forgiveness of the loans.
● Non-acquired loans secured by non-owner occupied and consumer real estate were $9.0 billion and comprised 37.6% of the total loan portfolio. This was an increase of $2.6 million, or 40.5%, over December 31, 2020. Acquired loans secured by non-owner occupied and consumer real estate were $4.6 billion and comprised 19.2% of the total loan portfolio. This was a decrease of $2.0 million, or 30.8%, over December 31, 2020. Between both the non-acquired and acquired portfolios, 56.7% of loans were non-owner occupied and consumer real estate loans.
o Of these non-acquired real estate loans, $5.6 billion, or 23.5% of the loan portfolio were secured by non-owner occupied real estate. Loans secured by consumer real estate were $3.4 billion, or 14.1% of the total
loan portfolio. This compared to loans secured by non-owner occupied real estate of $3.6 billion, or 14.7% and to loans secured by consumer real estate of $2.8 billion, or 11.2% at December 31, 2020.
o Of these acquired real estate loans, $3.1 billion, or 13.2% of the loan portfolio were secured by non-owner occupied real estate at December 31, 2021. Loans secured by consumer real estate were $1.4 billion, or 6.0%. This compared to acquired loans secured by non-owner occupied real estate of $4.4 billion, or 17.9% and to loans secured by consumer real estate of $2.2 billion, or 8.9% at December 31, 2020.
● Non-acquired and acquired commercial owner-occupied real estate loans were $3.1 billion, or 13.0% and $1.9 billion or 7.8%, respectively, of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2021 compared to $2.3 billion, or 9.2% and $2.6 billion or 10.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2020. Non-acquired commercial owner-occupied real estate loans increased $835.5 million through organic growth and renewals of acquired loans and acquired commercial owner-occupied real estate loans decreased $698.1 million due to principal payments, charge offs, foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans that were moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio from December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2021.
● Non-acquired and acquired commercial and industrial loans were $2.9 billion, or 12.1% and $855.5 million or 3.6%, respectively, of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2021 compared to $2.8 billion, or 11.2% and $2.3 billion or 9.3%, respectively, at December 31, 2020. Non-acquired commercial and industrial loans increased $149.9 million and acquired commercial and industrial loans decreased $1.4 billion from December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2021. The overall increase in non-acquired commercial and industrial loans included a $729.0 million decline in PPP loans while the overall decrease in acquired commercial and industrial loans included a $959.8 million decline in PPP loans.
Total loan interest income, excluding interest income on held for sale loans, was $983.7 million in 2021, an increase of $140.8 million, or 16.7%, over $842.9 million in 2020, due to a $3.4 billion increase in the average balance of our non-acquired loan portfolio and a $1.4 billion increase in the average balance of our acquired loan portfolio. The growth in the non-acquired loan portfolio average balance was due to normal organic growth and renewals of acquired loans. The growth in the acquired loan portfolio was due to the merger with CSFL that occurred during June of 2020 where the Company acquired approximately $13.0 billion in loans. The effects on interest income from the increases in average portfolio balances were offset by a 12 basis point decrease in the yield on the non-acquired portfolio and a 41 basis point decrease in the yield on the acquired portfolio. The yield on the non-acquired loan portfolio decreased from 3.91% in 2020 to 3.79% in 2021 and the yield on the acquired loan portfolio declined from 4.90% in 2020 to 4.49% in 2021. The decline in the yields on the non-acquired loan portfolio and the acquired loan portfolio was mainly due to the falling interest rate environment as the Federal Reserve dropped the federal funds target rate 150 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% in March 2020 in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, and remains unchanged to date.
Total construction and land development loans were $2.0 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to $1.9 billion at December 31, 2020. Non-acquired construction and land development loans increased $509.0 million in 2021 from $1.3 million at December 31, 2020 to $1.8 billion. Acquired construction and land development loans decreased $370.7 million in 2021 from $610.8 million at December 31, 2020 to $240.1 million. Construction and land development loans are more susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle.
Total consumer real estate loans were comprised of $3.6 billion in consumer owner occupied loans and $1.2 billion in home equity line loans at December 31, 2021. This compares to $3.7 billion in consumer owner occupied loans and $1.3 billion in home equity lines loans at December 31, 2020. Non-acquired loans secured by consumer real estate were comprised of $2.7 billion in consumer owner occupied loans and $710.3 million in home equity loans at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2020, we had $2.2 billion in consumer owner occupied loans and $601.2 million in home equity loans in the non-acquired loan portfolio. Acquired loans secured by consumer real estate comprised of $977.3 million in consumer owner occupied loans and $458.3 million in home equity loans at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2020, we had $1.5 billion in consumer owner occupied loans and $690.9 million in home equity loans in the acquired loan portfolio. During 2021, we have seen the consumer real estate loan portfolio decrease by $167.9 million from 2020 as consumers have paid down debt with all the excess liquidity in the marketplace in 2021 through government stimulus and conservative consumer spending habits during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Troubled Debt Restructurings (“TDRs”)
We designate expected credit losses over the contractual term of a loan. When determining the contractual term, the Company considers expected prepayments but is precluded from considering expected extensions, renewals, or modifications, unless the Company reasonably expects it will execute a TDR with a borrower. In the event of a reasonably-expected TDR, the Company factors the reasonably-expected TDR into the current expected credit losses estimate. For consumer loans, the point at which a TDR is reasonably expected is when the Company approves the borrower’s application for a modification (i.e., the borrower qualifies for the TDR) or when the Credit Administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans. For commercial loans, the point at which a TDR is reasonably expected is when the Company approves the loan for modification or when the Credit Administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans. The Company uses a discounted cash flow methodology for a TDR to calculate the effect of the concession provided to the borrower within the ACL.
A restructuring that results in only a delay in payments that is insignificant is not considered an economic concession. In accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, the Company implemented loan modification programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms. The Company’s payment relief assistance includes forbearance, deferrals, extension and re-aging programs, along with certain other modification strategies. The Company elected the accounting policy in the CARES Act to not apply TDR accounting to loans modified for borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic if the concession met the criteria as defined under the CARES Act. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, total TDRs were $12.5 million and $19.7 million, respectively, of which $11.2 million were accruing restructured loans at December 31, 2021, compared to $14.6 million at December 31, 2020. We do not have significant commitments to lend additional funds to these borrowers whose loans have been modified.
The level of risk elements in the loan portfolio, OREO and other nonperforming assets for the past two years is shown below:
Table 15-Nonperforming Assets
(1) Consists of real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure. Excludes certain property no longer intended for bank use.
(2) Excludes non-acquired bank premises held for sale of $1.0 million and $2.2 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, that is now separately disclosed on the balance sheet.
(3) Consists of non-real estate foreclosed assets, such as repossessed vehicles.
(4) Includes nonaccrual loans that are purchase credit deteriorated (PCD loans).
(5) Excludes acquired bank premises held for sale of $8.6 million and $33.8 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, that is now separately disclosed on the balance sheet.
(6) Loan data excludes mortgage loans held for sale.
(7) For purposes of this calculation, total assets include all assets (both acquired and non-acquired).
Total non-acquired nonperforming loans were $23.3 million, or 0.15% of total non-acquired loans, a decrease of approximately $5.9 million, or 20.1%, from December 31, 2020. The decrease in nonperforming loans was driven primarily by a decrease in accruing loans past due 90 days or more of $5.0 million, a decrease in restructured nonaccrual loans of $3.1 million, a decrease in consumer nonaccrual loans of $1.3 million, offset by an increase in commercial nonaccrual loans of $3.5 million. The decline in non-acquired accruing loans past due 90 days or more from 2020 was due to a decline in past due loans related to financing receivables from CBI. These loans are deemed low risk and their past due status can fluctuate due to the type of factoring receivable. Acquired nonperforming loans were $57.0 million, or 0.72% of total acquired loans, a decrease of $20.7 million, or 26.7%, from December 31, 2020. The decrease in acquired nonperforming loans was mainly driven by a decrease in consumer nonaccrual loans of $16.1 million, a decrease in commercial nonaccrual loans of $2.7 million and a decrease in accruing loans past due 90 days or more of $1.8 million. The decline in acquired consumer nonaccrual loans was mostly related to a decline in nonaccrual consumer real estate loans in 2021.
Non-acquired nonperforming loans decreased by approximately $2.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2021 from the level at September 30, 2021. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in consumer nonaccrual loans of $3.9 million, a decrease in restructured nonaccrual loans of $1.2 million, offset by an increase in accruing loans past due 90
days or more of $2.9 million. Acquired nonperforming loans decreased by approximately $7.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2021 from the level at September 30, 2021. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in consumer nonaccruals of $6.4 million and a decrease in commercial nonaccruals of $1.4 million. The top ten nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2021 totaled $20.0 million and consisted of two loans located in South Carolina, four in the Georgia, and four in Florida. These loans comprise 26.5% of total nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2021, with the majority being real estate collateral dependent. We do not currently hold a specific reserve against any of these ten loans due to carrying balances being below current collateral values.
At December 31, 2021, non-acquired OREO decreased by $300,000 from the balance at December 31, 2020 to $252,000. At December 31, 2021, non-acquired OREO consisted of one property with an average value of $252,000, an increase of $173,000 in the average value from December 31, 2020 when we had 7 properties. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we added one property with an aggregate value of $252,000 into non-acquired OREO, and we sold two properties with a basis of $81,000 in that same quarter. We recorded a net gain of $6,000 on the properties sold during the fourth quarter of 2021. Our non-acquired OREO property at December 31, 2021 is located in the Central region (Columbia, SC).
At December 31, 2021, acquired OREO decreased by $8.9 million from the balance at December 31, 2020 to $2.5 million. At December 31, 2021, non-acquired OREO consisted of 11 properties with an average value of $226,000, a decrease of $99,000 from December 31, 2020 when we had 35 properties. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we added two properties with an aggregate value of $874,000 into acquired OREO, and we sold 12 properties with a basis of $1.7 million in that same quarter. We recorded a net gain of $618,000 on the properties sold during the quarter. Our general policy is to obtain updated OREO valuations at least annually. OREO valuations include appraisals or broker opinions, (See Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”) under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion on our OREO policies.)
Potential Problem Loans
Potential problem loans, which are not included in nonperforming loans, related to non-acquired loans were approximately $6.9 million, or 0.04% of total non-acquired loans outstanding at December 31, 2021, compared to $5.9 million, or 0.05% of total non-acquired loans outstanding at December 31, 2020. Potential problem loans related to acquired loans totaled $19.3 million, or 0.24%, of total acquired loans at December 31, 2021, compared to $13.4 million, or 0.11% of total acquired loans outstanding, at December 31, 2020. All potential problem loans represent those loans where information about possible credit problems of the borrowers has caused Management to have concern about the borrower’s ability to comply with present repayment terms.
Allowance for Credit Losses (“ACL”)
As stated previously, the ACL reflects Management’s estimate of expected credit losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. At adoption of ASU 2016-13, the Company established the incremental increase in the ACL through equity and subsequent adjustments through a provision for or recovery of credit losses recorded to earnings. The Company records loans charged off against the ACL and subsequent recoveries, if any, increase the ACL when they are recognized.
Management uses systematic methodologies to determine its ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loan portfolio. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company’s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, Management’s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. The Company’s ACL recorded in the balance sheet reflects Management’s best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The Company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for Management’s current estimate of expected credit losses. The Company’s ACL is calculated using collectively evaluated and individually evaluated loans.
The Company merged with CSFL on June 7, 2020. For the second quarter ended June 30, 2020, given the proximity of the merger date to the quarter end, Management collectively evaluated loans from each legacy loan portfolio utilizing pre-existing methodologies implemented prior to the merger and aggregated the result. During the third quarter of 2020, Management consolidated the two methodologies into one to arrive at the ACL recorded at September 30, 2020 for both the ACL related to the loan portfolio and the reserve related to the unfunded commitments
(off-balance-sheet credit exposures). The new methodology for unfunded commitments utilizes a funding rate, as opposed to a utilization rate which was a method applied to the SouthState legacy portfolio prior to the third quarter, to determine the reserve for each respective segment of unfunded commitments. This new method, along with the change in mix of unfunded commitments, resulted in an increase in the reserve for legacy SouthState Bank unfunded commitments during the third quarter of 2020.
The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Loans with similar risk characteristics are grouped into homogenous segments, or pools, for analysis. The Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) method is utilized for each loan in a pool, and the results are aggregated at the pool level. A periodic tendency to default and absolute loss given default are applied to a projective model of the loan’s cash flow while considering prepayment and principal curtailment effects. The analysis produces expected cash flows for each instrument in the pool by pairing loan-level term information (e.g., maturity date, payment amount, interest rate, etc.) with top-down pool assumptions (e.g., default rates and prepayment speeds). The Company has identified the following portfolio segments: Owner-Occupied Commercial Real Estate, Non Owner-Occupied Commercial Real Estate, Multifamily, Municipal, Commercial and Industrial, Commercial Construction and Land Development, Residential Construction, Residential Senior Mortgage, Residential Junior Mortgage, Revolving Mortgage, and Consumer and Other.
In determining the proper level of the ACL, Management has determined that the loss experience of the Bank provides the best basis for its assessment of expected credit losses. It therefore utilized its own historical credit loss experience by each loan segment over an economic cycle, while excluding loss experience from certain acquired institutions (i.e., failed banks). For most of the segment models for collectively evaluated loans, the Company incorporated two or more macroeconomic drivers using a statistical regression modeling methodology.
Management considers forward-looking information in estimating expected credit losses. The Company subscribes to a third-party service which provides a quarterly macroeconomic baseline outlook and alternative scenarios for the United States economy. The baseline, along with the evaluation of alternative scenarios, is used by Management to determine the best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. Management has evaluated the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios and has made adjustments as needed. Management evaluates the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios and takes into consideration the scenarios in relation to actual economic and other data (such as COVID-19 epidemiological data and federal stimulus), as well as the volatility and magnitude of changes within those scenarios quarter over quarter, and consideration of condition within the bank’s operating environment and geographic area. Additional forecast scenarios may be weighed along with the baseline forecast to arrive at the final reserve estimate. While periods of relative economic stability should generally lead to stability in forecast scenarios and weightings to estimate credit losses, periods of instability can likewise require Management to adjust the selection of scenarios and weightings, in accordance with the accounting standards. For the contractual term that extends beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to the long term mean of historical factors within four quarters using a straight-line approach. The Company generally utilizes a four-quarter forecast and a four-quarter reversion period.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created increased volatility and uncertainties within the economy and economic forecasts. Accordingly, Management has used a blended forecast scenario of the baseline and more severe scenario ranging between two-thirds baseline and one-third more severe scenario to an equal weight between the baseline and more severe scenario since December 31, 2020, depending on the circumstances and economic outlook. As of December 31, 2021, Management selected a baseline weighting of 55%, down from 60% in the third quarter of 2021, and increased the more severe scenario to 45%, as several issues have materialized that warrant a more cautious approach. These issues include, but are not limited to, level of optimism in the baseline forecast outlook as compared to consensus forecasts; political impediments to moving the Build Back America legislation forward; persistent headwinds related to the Omicron variant of COVID-19; and growing evidence that inflationary pressures in the labor market and supply chains are more than transitory. The resulting release was approximately $9.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2021. If the economic forecast weighting had not been adjusted from the third quarter of 2021, this would have resulted in a higher release of approximately $13.4 million, which Management deemed inappropriate given the underlying economic conditions and likelihood of additional stimulus as compared with assumptions in the baseline scenario.
Included in its systematic methodology to determine its ACL, Management considers the need to qualitatively adjust expected credit losses for information not already captured in the loss estimation process. These qualitative adjustments either increase or decrease the quantitative model estimation (i.e., formulaic model results). Each period the
Company considers qualitative factors that are relevant within the qualitative framework that includes the following: 1) Lending Policy; 2) Economic conditions not captured in models; 3) Volume and Mix of Loan Portfolio; 4) Past Due Trends; 5) Concentration Risk; 6) External Factors; and 7) Model Limitations.
When a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with its segment, the asset is assessed to determine whether it should be included in another pool or should be individually evaluated. The Company’s threshold for individually-evaluated loans includes all non-accrual loans with a net book balance in excess of $1.0 million. Management will monitor the credit environment and make adjustments to this threshold in the future if warranted. Based on the threshold above, consumer financial assets will generally remain in pools unless they meet the dollar threshold. The expected credit losses on individually-evaluated loans will be estimated based on discounted cash flow analysis unless the loan meets the criteria for use of the fair value of collateral, either by virtue of an expected foreclosure or through meeting the definition of collateral-dependent. Financial assets that have been individually evaluated can be returned to a pool for purposes of estimating the expected credit loss insofar as their credit profile improves and that the repayment terms were not considered to be unique to the asset.
Management measures expected credit losses over the contractual term of a loan. When determining the contractual term, the Company considers expected prepayments but is precluded from considering expected extensions, renewals, or modifications, unless the Company reasonably expects it will execute a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) with a borrower. In the event of a reasonably-expected TDR, the Company factors the reasonably-expected TDR into the current expected credit losses estimate. For consumer loans, the point at which a TDR is reasonably expected is when the Company approves the borrower’s application for a modification (i.e., the borrower qualifies for the TDR) or when the Credit Administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans. For commercial loans, the point at which a TDR is reasonably expected is when the Company approves the loan for modification or when the Credit Administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans. The Company uses a discounted cash flow methodology for a TDR to calculate the effect of the concession provided to the borrower within the ACL.
A restructuring that results in only a delay in payments that is insignificant is not considered an economic concession. In accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, the Company implemented loan modification programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms. The Company’s payment relief assistance includes forbearance, deferrals, extension and re-aging programs, along with certain other modification strategies. The Company elected the accounting policy in the CARES Act to not apply TDR accounting to loans modified for borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic if the concession met the criteria as defined under the CARES Act.
For purchased credit-deteriorated, otherwise referred to herein as PCD, assets are defined as acquired individual financial assets (or acquired groups of financial assets with similar risk characteristics) that, as of the date of acquisition, have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, as determined by the Company’s assessment. The Company records acquired PCD loans by adding the expected credit losses (i.e., allowance for credit losses) to the purchase price of the financial assets rather than recording through the provision for credit losses in the income statement. The expected credit loss, as of the acquisition day, of a PCD loan is added to the allowance for credit losses. The non-credit discount or premium is the difference between the unpaid principal balance and the amortized cost basis as of the acquisition date. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the change in the ACL on PCD loans is recognized through the provision for credit losses. The non-credit discount or premium is accreted or amortized, respectively, into interest income over the remaining life of the PCD loan on a level-yield basis. In accordance with the transition requirements within the standard, the Company’s acquired credit-impaired loans (i.e., ACI or Purchased Credit Impaired) were treated as PCD loans.
The Company follows its nonaccrual policy by reversing contractual interest income in the income statement when the Company places a loan on nonaccrual status. Therefore, Management excludes the accrued interest receivable balance from the amortized cost basis in measuring expected credit losses on the portfolio and does not record an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the accrued interest receivable for loans recorded in Other Assets were $70.6 million and $93.9 million, respectively.
The Company has a variety of assets that have a component that qualifies as an off-balance sheet exposure. These primarily include undrawn portions of revolving lines of credit and standby letters of credit. The expected losses associated with these exposures within the unfunded portion of the expected credit loss will be recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. Management has determined that a majority of the Company’s off-balance-sheet credit exposures are not unconditionally cancellable. Management completes funding studies based on historical data to estimate the
percentage of unfunded loan commitments that will ultimately be funded to calculate the reserve for unfunded commitments. Management applies this funding rate, along with the loss factor rate determined for each pooled loan segment, to unfunded loan commitments, excluding unconditionally cancellable exposures and letters of credit, to arrive at the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the liabilities recorded for expected credit losses on unfunded commitments were $30.5 million and $43.4 million, respectively. The current adjustment to the ACL for unfunded commitments is recognized through the Provision for Credit Losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company did not have an allowance for credit losses or record a provision for credit losses on investment securities or other financials asset during 2021.
With the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the Company changed its method for calculating the allowance for loans from an incurred loss method to a life of loan method. See Note 1-Significant Accounting Policies. As of December 31, 2021, the balance of the ACL was $301.8 million or 1.26% of total loans. The ACL decreased $12.3 million from the balance of $314.1 million recorded at September 30, 2021. This decrease during the fourth quarter of 2021 included an $11.4 million release or decline in the provision for credit losses in addition to $1.0 million in net charge-offs. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the ACL decreased $155.5 million from the balance of $457.3 million. The decrease in ACL of $155.5 million was due to a release of the allowance for credit losses of $152.4 million along with net charge-offs of $3.1 million in 2021. For both the three and twelve months ended December 30, 2021, the Company had releases of allowance for credit losses resulting from improvements in the economic forecasts that drive our ACL model. The improvement in the economy and the increased availability and higher percentage of people receiving the COVID-19 vaccine and boosters contributed to the change in the economic forecasts. As of December 31, 2020, the balance of the ACL was $457.3 million or 1.85% of total loans. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the ACL increased $400.1 million from the balance of $56.9 million. This increase included a $199.4 million provision for credit losses during the period (which includes $109.4 million of provision recorded for non-PCD loans acquired through the merger with CSFL), a $149.4 million allowance for credit losses recorded on acquisition date on PCD loans acquired from CSFL and an increase of $54.5 million through the impact of the initial adoption of CECL. These increases in 2020 were partially offset by $2.8 million in net charge-offs.
At December 31, 2021, the Company had a reserve on unfunded commitments of $30.5 million which was recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, compared to $43.4 million at December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a release of the reserve for unfunded commitments, or recovery for credit losses, on unfunded commitments of $12.9 million. With the improvement in the economy and the increased availability of the COVID-19 vaccine, the Company began to release some of this reserve for unfunded commitments based on improvements in economic forecasts. This amount was recorded in (Recovery) Provision for Credit Losses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. With the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the Company increased its reserve on unfunded commitments by $6.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments was $36.6 million. Included in the provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020, $9.6 million was related to the merger with CSFL, which was completed during the second quarter of 2020. The Company did not have an allowance for credit losses or record a provision for credit losses on investment securities or other financials asset during the first nine months of 2021 or 2020.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the allowance for credit losses was $301.8 million, or 1.26%, of period-end loans. The ACL provides 3.76 times coverage of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2021, compared to 4.28 times at December 31, 2020. Net charge offs to total average loans during the year ended December 31, 2021 were 0.01%, the same percentage as for the year ended December 31, 2020. We continued to show solid and stable asset quality numbers and ratios as of December 31, 2021. The following table provides the allocation, by segment, for expected credit losses. Because PPP loans are government guaranteed and Management implemented additional reviews and procedures to help mitigate potential losses, Management does not expect to recognize credit losses on this loan portfolio and as a result, did not record an ACL for PPP loans within the C&I loan segment presented in the table below.

Table 21-Summary of Acquired Credit Impaired Loan Loss Experience
During 2019, the valuation allowance on acquired credit impaired loans increased by $460,000, or 10.0%. This was the result of impairments of $1.2 million which were recorded through the provision for loan losses, being offset by loan removals of $723,000 due to loans being paid off, fully charged off or transferred to OREO. Impairments are recognized immediately and releases are generally spread over time.
Deposits
We rely on deposits by our customers as the primary source of funds for the continued growth of our loan and investment securities portfolios. Customer deposits are categorized as either noninterest-bearing deposits or interest-bearing deposits. Noninterest-bearing deposits (or demand deposits) are transaction accounts that provide us with “interest-free” sources of funds. Interest-bearing deposits include savings deposit, interest-bearing transaction accounts, certificates of deposits, and other time deposits. Interest-bearing transaction accounts include HSA, IOLTA, and Market Rate checking accounts.
During 2021, all categories of deposits increased from 2020 except for time deposits. Total deposits increased $4.4 billion, or 14.2%, to $35.1 billion during 2021. The year-over-year growth was primarily due to the federal government pushing funds into the market through stimulus programs, in addition to consumers remaining conservative in their spending habits in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our deposit growth since December 31, 2020 included an increase in interest-bearing demand deposits of $2.9 billion, noninterest-bearing transaction account deposits of $1.8 billion, and saving deposits of $656.5 million. These increases were offset by a decline in time deposits of $938.5 million. During 2021, we continued our focus on increasing core deposits (excluding certificates of deposits and other time deposits), which are normally lower cost funds compared to certificate of deposit balances.
The following table presents total deposits for the two years at December 31:
Table 22-Total Deposits
Overall deposits grew through organic growth during 2021 from December 31, 2020. The following are key highlights regarding overall growth in total deposits:
● Total deposits increased $4.4 billion, or 14.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020, driven by organic growth with all the excess liquidity currently in the market place due to the government stimulus and conservative consumer spending habits related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
o Noninterest-bearing deposits (demand deposits) increased by $1.8 billion, or 18.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, when compared with December 31, 2020.
o Money market (Market Rate Checking) and other interest-bearing demand deposits increased $3.5 billion, or 20.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2021.
o Savings deposits increased $656.5 million, or 24.4%, when compared with December 31, 2020.
o At December 31, 2021, the ratio of savings, interest-bearing demand deposits, and time deposits to total deposits was 67.2%, a decrease of 1.2%, compared with the ratio of 68.4% at the end of 2020.
The following are key highlights regarding overall growth in average total deposits:
● Total deposits averaged $33.0 billion in 2021, an increase of $10.4 billion, or 45.8%, from 2020.
o Average interest-bearing deposits increased by $6.5 billion, or 41.9%, to $22.0 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, due to organic growth and having a full year's impact in 2021 from the deposits assumed through the CSFL merger in 2020.
o Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased by $3.9 billion, or 54.2%, to $11.0 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, due to organic growth and having a full year's impact in 2021 from the deposits assumed through the CSFL merger in 2020.
The following table provides a maturity distribution of certificates of deposit of $250,000 or more for the next twelve months as of December 31:
Table 23-Maturity Distribution of Certificates of Deposits of $250 Thousand or More
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company estimates that is has approximately $12.4 billion and $10.0 billion, respectively, in uninsured deposits including related interest accrued and unpaid. Since it is not reasonably practicable to provide a precise measure of uninsured deposits, the amounts above are estimates and are based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for the bank’s regulatory reporting requirements by the FDIC for the Call Report.
The following table provides a maturity distribution of uninsured time deposits for the next twelve months as of December 31:
Table 24-Maturity Distribution of Uninsured Deposits
Short-Term Borrowed Funds
Our short-term borrowed funds consist of federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, FRB borrowings on a secured line of credit, short-term FHLB Advances and the U.S. Bank line of credit. Note 10-Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase in our audited financial statements provides a profile of these funds at each year-end, the average amounts outstanding during each period, the maximum amounts outstanding at any month-end, and the weighted average interest rates on year-end and average balances in each category. Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase most typically have maturities within one to three days from the transaction date. Certain of these borrowings have no defined maturity date. Note 11-Other Borrowings in our audited financial statements provide provides a profile of short-term FHLB advances, FRB borrowings and the U.S. Bank line of credit at each year-end, the average amount outstanding during each period and the weighted average interest rates on year-end and average balance. Short-term FHLB advances have a maturity of less than one year and the FRB borrowings and U.S. Bank line of credit had a daily maturity.
Long-Term Borrowed Funds
Our long-term borrowed funds consist of trust preferred junior subordinated debt and corporate subordinated debt. Note 11-Other Borrowings in our audited financial statements provides a profile of these funds at each year-end, the balance at year end, the interest rate at year end and the weighted average interest rate for long-term borrowings. Each issuance of trust preferred junior subordinated debt has a maturity of 30 years, but we can call the debt at any point without penalty.
Capital and Dividends
Our ongoing capital requirements have been met primarily through retained earnings, less the payment of cash dividends. As of December 31, 2021, shareholders’ equity was $4.8 billion, an increase of $155.1 million, or 3.3%, compared to the balance at December 31, 2020. The change from year-end 2020 was mainly attributable to net income of $475.5 million, less dividends paid on common shares of $135.2 million, common stock repurchased under our stock repurchase plan of $146.4 million and a decline in the AOCI attributable to a decrease in the market value of securities available for sale of $68.9 million.
The following shows the changes in shareholders’ equity during 2021:
Table 25-Changes in Shareholders’ Equity
Our equity-to-assets ratio decreased to 11.4% at December 31, 2021 from 12.3% at December 31, 2020. The decrease from December 31, 2020 was due to the percentage increase in equity of 3.3% being less than the percentage increase in total assets of 11.0%. The increase in assets was mainly due to the increase in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities as deposits grew 14.2% providing the bank with excess liquidity during 2021. The lower percentage growth in capital was mainly due to the Company repurchasing $146.4 million in common stock through its stock repurchase plan and paying dividends on common shares of $135.2 million in 2021.
On January 25, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a program (“2019 Repurchase Program”) to repurchase up to 1,000,000 of our common stock. In June 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 2,000,000 shares of our common stock under the Company’s 2019 Repurchase Program after considering,
among other things, our liquidity needs and capital resources as well as the estimated current value of our net assets. In 2019, the Company repurchased a total of 2,165,000 shares for $156.9 million, or $72.49 per share (excluding commission expense), of which 1,000,000 shares were from the 2019 Repurchase Program and the remaining 1,165,000 shares were from the revised 2019 Repurchase Program. The Company repurchased an additional 320,000 shares for $24.7 million, or $77.23 per share (excluding commission expense) in 2020 under the 2019 Repurchase Program for a total of 1,485,000 repurchased under the 2,000,000 authorized. On January 27, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the authorization of a new 3,500,000 million share Company stock repurchase plan, which replaced in its entirety the 2019 Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2021, we repurchased 1,817,941 shares, at an average price of $80.51 per share, excluding cost of commissions, for a total of $146.4 million, under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Plan and may repurchase up to an additional 1,682,059 shares of common stock under the program. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of the purchases during 2021, 2020 and 2019 were based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of cash balances, general business conditions, regulatory requirements, the market price of our common stock, and the availability of alternative investment opportunities.
We are subject to regulations with respect to certain risk-based capital ratios. These risk-based capital ratios measure the relationship of capital to a combination of balance sheet and off-balance sheet risks. The values of both balance sheet and off-balance sheet items are adjusted based on the rules to reflect categorical credit risk. In addition to the risk-based capital ratios, the regulatory agencies have also established a leverage ratio for assessing capital adequacy. The leverage ratio is equal to Tier 1 capital divided by total consolidated on-balance sheet assets (minus amounts deducted from Tier 1 capital). The leverage ratio does not involve assigning risk weights to assets.
Specifically, we are required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios:
• a CET1, risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%;
• a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%;
• a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%; and
• a leverage ratio of 4%.
Under the current capital rules, Tier 1 capital includes two components: CET1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The highest form of capital, CET1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, otherwise referred to as AOCI, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, Tier 1 minority interests and grandfathered trust preferred securities (as discussed below). Tier 2 capital generally includes the allowance for loan losses up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, qualifying preferred stock, subordinated debt and qualifying tier 2 minority interests, less any deductions in Tier 2 instruments of an unconsolidated financial institution. Cumulative perpetual preferred stock is included only in Tier 2 capital, except that the capital rules permit bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets to continue to include trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 Capital (but not in CET1 capital), subject to certain restrictions. With the merger with CSFL during the second quarter of 2020, the Company’s trust preferred securities no longer qualifies for Tier 1 capital and is now only included in Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital calculations. AOCI is presumptively included in CET1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital. When the current capital rules were first implemented, the Bank exercised its one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI, allowing us to retain our pre-existing treatment for AOCI.
In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a banking organization must maintain a “capital conservation buffer” on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three risk-based measurements (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital), resulting in the following effective minimum capital plus capital conservation buffer ratios: (i) a CET1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%.
The Bank is also subject to the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, which identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized) and is based on specified thresholds for each of the three risk-based regulatory capital ratios (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital) and for the leverage ratio.
The federal banking agencies revised their regulatory capital rules to (i) address the implementation of CECL; (ii) provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting CECL; and (iii) require the use of CECL in stress tests beginning with the 2020 capital planning and stress testing cycle for certain banking organizations that are subject to stress testing. CECL became effective for us on January 1, 2020 and the Company applied the provisions of the standard using the modified retrospective method as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. Related to the implementation of ASU 2016-13, we recorded additional allowance for credit losses for loans of $54.4 million, deferred tax assets of $12.6 million, an additional reserve for unfunded commitments of $6.4 million and an adjustment to retained earnings of $44.8 million. Instead of recognizing the effects on regulatory capital from ASU 2016-13 at adoption, the Company initially elected the option for recognizing the adoption date effects on the Company’s regulatory capital calculations over a three-year phase-in.
In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule for additional transitional relief to regulatory capital related to the impact of the adoption of CECL. The final rule provides banking organizations that adopt CECL in the 2020 calendar year with the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by the aforementioned three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of benefit during the initial two-year delay for a total five-year transition. The estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital (modified CECL transitional amount) is calculated as the sum of the impact on retained earnings upon adoption of CECL (CECL transitional amount) and the calculated change in the ACL relative to the ACL upon adoption of CECL multiplied by a scaling factor of 25%. The scaling factor is used to approximate the difference in the ACL under CECL relative to the incurred loss methodology. The modified CECL transitional amount will be calculated each quarter for the first two years of the five-year transition. The amount of the modified CECL transition amount will be fixed as of December 31, 2021, and that amount will be subject to the three-year phase-out. The Company chose the five-year transition method and is deferring the recognition of the effects from the adoption date and the change in the ACL relative to the ACL on adoption date for the first two years of application.
Table 26-Capital Adequacy Ratios
The following table presents our consolidated capital ratios under the applicable capital rules:
The Tier 1 leverage ratio and the total risk-based capital ratio both decreased compared to the ratios at December 31, 2020. The Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio both stayed relatively flat in 2021 as they only declined 2 basis points. The Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased from 2020 as tier 1 capital (excluding the change in AOCI) increased by $191.5 million or 6.4%, while total average eligible assets increased $3.4 billion, or 9.3%. The Tier 1 leverage ratio declined as the percentage increase in Tier 1 risk-based capital was less than the percentage increase in the average assets for regulatory capital purposes. The increase in average assets was mainly due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments from December 31, 2020 with deposits growing as the federal government has pushed funds into the market through stimulus programs, in addition to consumers remaining conservative in their spending habits. The lower percentage increase in Tier 1 risk-based capital was mainly due to the Company repurchasing 1,817,941 common shares for $146.4 million through its stock repurchase plan in 2021. The total risk-based capital ratio decreased in 2021 as total risk-weighted assets increased $1.7 billion or 6.5% while total risk-based capital (excluding the change in accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI) grew by $50.6 million or 1.4%. The decrease in the total risk-based capital ratio at the Company was due to the percentage increase in total risk-based capital being less than the percentage increase in total risk-based assets. The reason for the lower percentage increase in the total risk-based capital at the Company was due the redemption of $25.0 million in subordinated debt and $38.5 million in trust preferred securities during the second quarter of 2021 that was included in total risked-based capital along with the amount of allowance for credit losses eligible for capital purposes declining $77.3 million with the releases of provision in 2021. The lower percentage increase in Tier 1 risk-based capital was also due to the Company repurchasing 1,817,941 common shares for $146.4 million through its stock repurchase plan in 2021. The Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio both stayed relatively flat in 2021 as they only declined 2 basis points as the percentage change in Tier 1 risk-based capital and the percentage change in total risk-based asset were approximately the same in 2021 compared to 2020. Our capital ratios are currently
well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the “well capitalized” regulatory classification.
The Company pays cash dividends to shareholders from its assets, which are mainly provided by dividends from its banking subsidiary. However, certain restrictions exist regarding the ability of its subsidiary to transfer funds to the Company in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances. The approval of the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus. The federal banking agencies have issued policy statements which provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current earnings.
During 2021, the Bank paid dividends to SouthState totaling $200.0 million. The Bank was not required to get approval of the OCC to pay these dividends. We used these funds and excess cash to pay our dividend to shareholders of $135.3 million, repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market totaling $146.4 million and redeem $63.5 million in trust preferred securities and subordinated debentures. During first quarter of 2020, the Bank paid special dividends to the Company totaling $24.7 million for which SCBFI approval was not required. These funds were used to repurchase Company stock on the open market totaling $24.7 million during the first quarter of 2020. The Bank also paid a special dividend of $33.0 million during the first quarter of 2020 to provide the Company with more general operating liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic. During 2019, the Bank paid special dividends to the Company totaling $157.0 million for which SCBFI approval was required. The Bank received approval from the SCBFI in June 2019 to pay an additional $60.0 million above current year net income in dividends to the Company. These funds were used to repurchase Company stock on the open market totaling $156.9 million during 2019.
The following table provides the amount of dividends and payout ratios for the years ended December 31:
Table 27-Dividends Paid to Common Shareholders
We retain earnings to have capital sufficient to grow our loan and investment portfolios and to support certain acquisitions or other business expansion opportunities. The dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing dividends paid during the year by net income for the year.
Liquidity
Liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our financial obligations, which arise primarily from the withdrawal of deposits, extension of credit and payment of operating expenses. Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank’s financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by an inability (or perceived inability) to meet its obligations. Our Asset Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) is charged with the responsibility of monitoring policies that are designed to ensure acceptable composition of our asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. We have employed our funds in a manner to provide liquidity from both assets and liabilities sufficient to meet our cash needs.
Asset liquidity is maintained by the maturity structure of loans, investment securities and other short term investments. Management has policies and procedures governing the length of time to maturity on loans and investments. As reported in Table 7, less than one percent of the investment portfolio contractually matures in one year or less. This segment of the portfolio consists mostly of municipal obligations along with some paydowns of mortgage-backed securities. There is also an additional amount of securities that could be called or prepaid, as well as expected monthly paydowns of mortgage backed securities. Normally, changes in the earning asset mix are of a longer term nature and are not utilized for day to day corporate liquidity needs.
Our liabilities provide liquidity on a day to day basis. Daily liquidity needs are met from deposit levels or from our use of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, interest-bearing deposits at other banks and other short term borrowings. We engage in routine activities to retain deposits intended to enhance our liquidity position. These routine activities include various measures, such as the following:
● Emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers, where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with our Bank;
● Pricing deposits, including certificates of deposit, at rate levels that will attract and /or retain balances of deposits that will enhance our Bank’s asset/liability management and net interest margin requirements; and
● Continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our Bank’s appeal as a primary provider of financial services.
Our non-acquired loan portfolio increased by approximately $3.8 billion, or approximately 30.6%, compared to the balance at December 31, 2020. The non-acquired loan balance includes $228.9 million PPP loans outstanding at December 31, 2021. Excluding PPP loans, the non-acquired loan portfolio increased by $4.5 billion, or 39.6% from December 31, 2020. The increase in the non-acquired loan portfolio was due to organic growth and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio. The acquired loan portfolio decreased by $4.5 billion, or 36.3%, from the balance at December 31, 2020. This decrease was through principal paydowns, charge-offs, foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans that moved into our non-acquired loan portfolio.
Our investment securities portfolio increased $2.7 billion, or 61.3% compared to the balance at December 31, 2020. The increase in investment securities from December 31, 2020 was a result of the Company strategically investing its excess funds from continued deposit growth. During 2021, we purchased $3.9 billion of securities, $975.3 million classified as held to maturity and $2.9 billion classified as available for sale. These increases were partially offset by maturities, calls, sales and paydowns of investment securities totaling $1.1 billion. Net amortization of premiums were $38.0 million in 2021. Total cash and cash equivalents were $6.8 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to $4.6 billion at December 31, 2020. The growth in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities was driven by the $4.4 billion increase in deposits during 2021.
At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had $325.0 million and $600.0 million of traditional, out-of-market brokered deposits. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had $900.1 million and $611.1 million, respectively, of reciprocal brokered deposits. Total deposits were $35.1 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $4.4 billion from $30.7 billion at December 31, 2020. Our deposit growth since December 31, 2020 included an increase in interest-bearing transaction accounts of $2.1 billion, an increase in demand deposit accounts of $1.8 billion, and an increase in savings and money market accounts of $1.4 billion partially offset by a decline in certificates of deposit of $938.5 million. Total short-term borrowings at December 31, 2021 were $781.2 million consisting of $381.2 million in federal funds purchased and $400.0 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Corporate and subordinated debentures decreased approximately $63.1 million in 2021 as the Company redeemed $38.5 million in trust preferred securities and $25.0 million in subordinated debentures, in addition to the repayment of $11.0 million of subordinated notes that matured during the second quarter of 2021. With the redemption of the trust preferred securities, the remaining fair value mark on these borrowings of $11.7 was written off as an extinguishment of debt cost. To the extent that we employ other types of non-deposit funding sources, typically to accommodate retail and correspondent customers, we continue to take in shorter maturities of such funds. Our current approach may provide an opportunity to sustain a low funding rate or possibly lower our cost of funds but could also increase our cost of funds if interest rates rise.
Through the operations of our Bank, we have made contractual commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of our business activities. These commitments are legally binding agreements to lend money to our customers at predetermined interest rates for a specified period of time. We manage the credit risk on these commitments by subjecting them to normal underwriting and risk management processes. We believe that we have adequate sources of liquidity to fund commitments that are drawn upon by the borrowers. In addition to commitments to extend credit, we also issue standby letters of credit, which are assurances to third parties that they will not suffer a loss if our customer fails to meet its contractual obligation to the third-party. Although our past experience indicates that many of these standby letters of credit will expire unused, through our various sources of liquidity, we believe that we will have the necessary resources to meet these obligations should the need arise.
Our ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position as reflected by such indicators as the composition of our earning assets, typically including some level of reverse repurchase agreements, federal funds sold, balances at the Federal Reserve Bank, and/or other short-term investments; asset quality; well-capitalized position; and profitable operating results. Cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt our desired liquidity position at any time. We expect that these conditions would generally be of a short-term nature. Under such circumstances, we expect
our reverse repurchase agreements and federal funds sold positions, or balances at the Federal Reserve Bank, if any, to serve as the primary source of immediate liquidity. At December 31, 2021, we had total federal funds credit lines of $300.0 million with no outstanding advances. If we needed additional liquidity, we would turn to short-term borrowings as an alternative immediate funding source and would consider other appropriate actions such as promotions to increase core deposits or the use of the brokered deposit markets. At December 31, 2021, we had $981.1 million of credit available at the Federal Reserve Bank’s discount window, but had no outstanding advances as of the end of 2021. In addition, we could draw on additional alternative immediate funding sources from lines of credit extended to us from our correspondent banks and/or the FHLB. At December 31, 2021, we had a total FHLB credit facility of $2.8 billion with $12.1 million in outstanding FHLB letters of credit to secure certain public funds deposits, leaving $2.8 billion in availability on the FHLB credit facility. We have a $100.0 million unsecured line of credit with U.S. Bank National Association with no outstanding advances. We believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available.
Our contingency funding plan describes several potential stages based on stressed liquidity levels. Liquidity key risk indicators are reported to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. During 2021, we conducted contingency funding plan stress tests on a quarterly basis. We maintain various wholesale sources of funding. If our deposit retention efforts were to be unsuccessful, we would utilize these alternative sources of funding. Under such circumstances, depending on the external source of funds, our interest cost would vary based on the range of interest rates charged. This could increase our cost of funds, impacting our net interest margin and net interest spread.
Asset-Liability Management and Market Risk Sensitivity
Our earnings and the economic value of equity vary in relation to the behavior of interest rates and the accompanying fluctuations in market prices of certain of our financial instruments. We define interest rate risk as the risk to earnings and equity arising from the behavior of interest rates. These behaviors include increases and decreases in interest rates as well as continuation of the current interest rate environment.
Our interest rate risk principally consists of reprice, option, basis, and yield curve risk. Reprice risk results from differences in the maturity or repricing characteristics of asset and liability portfolios. Option risk arises from embedded options in the investment and loan portfolios such as investment securities calls and loan prepayment options. Option risk also exists since deposit customers may withdraw funds at their discretion in response to general market conditions, competitive alternatives to existing accounts or other factors. The exercise of such options may result in higher costs or lower revenue. Basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices, which subsequently result in narrowing spreads on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Basis risk also exists in administered rate liabilities, such as interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts where the price sensitivity of such products may vary relative to general markets rates. Yield curve risk adverse consequences of nonparallel shifts in the yield curves of various market indices that impact our assets and liabilities.
We use simulation analysis as a primary method to assess earnings at risk and equity at risk due to assumed changes in interest rates. Management uses the results of its various simulation analyses in combination with other data and observations to formulate strategies designed to maintain interest rate risk within risk tolerances.
Simulation analysis involves the use of several assumptions including, but not limited to, the timing of cash flows such as the terms of contractual agreements, investment security calls, loan prepayment speeds, deposit attrition rates, the interest rate sensitivity of loans and deposits relative to general market rates, and the behavior of interest rates and spreads. Equity at risk simulation uses assumptions regarding discount rates that value cash flows. Simulation analysis is highly dependent on model assumptions that may vary from actual outcomes. Key simulation assumptions are subject to stress testing to assess the impact of assumption changes on earnings at risk and equity at risk. Model assumptions are reviewed by our Assumptions Committee.
Earnings at risk is defined as the percentage change in net interest income due to assumed changes in interest rates. Earnings at risk is generally used to assess interest rate risk over relatively short time horizons.
Equity at risk is defined as the percentage change in the net economic value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates compared to a base net economic value. The discounted present value of all cash flows
represents our economic value of equity. Equity at risk is generally considered a measure of the long-term interest rate exposures of the balance sheet at a point in time.
The earnings simulation models take into account our contractual agreements with regard to investments, loans, deposits, borrowings, and derivatives as well as a number of behavioral assumptions applied to certain assets and liabilities.
Mortgage banking derivatives used in the ordinary course of business consist of forward sales contracts and interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans. These derivatives involve underlying items, such as interest rates, and are designed to mitigate risk. Derivatives are also used to hedge mortgage servicing rights. For additional information see Note 28-Derivative Financial Instruments in the consolidated financial statements.
From time to time, we execute interest rate swaps to hedge some of our interest rate risks. Under these arrangements, the Company enters into a variable rate loan with a client in addition to a swap agreement. The swap agreement effectively converts the client’s variable rate loan into a fixed rate loan. The Company then enters into a matching swap agreement with a third-party dealer to offset its exposure on the customer swap. The Company may also execute interest rate swap agreements that are not specific to client loans. As of December 31, 2021, the Company did not have such agreements. For additional information on these derivatives refer to Note 28-Derivative Financial Instruments in the consolidated financial statements.
Our interest rate risk key indicators are applied to a static balance sheet using forward rates from the Moody’s Baseline Scenario. This Base Case Scenario assumes the maturity composition of asset and liability rollover volumes is modeled to approximately replicate current consolidated balance sheet characteristics throughout the simulation. These treatments are consistent with the Company’s goal of assessing current interest rate risk embedded in its current balance sheet. The Base Case Scenario assumes that maturing or repricing assets and liabilities are replaced at current market prices consistent with maintaining a stable balance sheet. Key rate drivers are used to price assets and liabilities with sensitivity assumptions used to price non-maturity deposits. The sensitivity assumptions for the pricing of non-maturity deposits are subjected to stress testing no less frequently than on an annual basis.
Interest rate shocks are applied to the Base Case on an instantaneous basis. The range of interest rate shocks will include upward and downward movements of rates through 400 basis points in 100 basis point increments. At times, market conditions may result in assumed rate movements that will be deemphasized. For example, during a period of ultra-low interest rates, certain downward rate shocks may be impractical. The Model simulation results produced from the Base Case Scenario and related instantaneous shocks for changes in net interest income and instantaneous rate shocks for changes in the economic value of equity are referred to as the Core Scenario Analysis and constitute the policy key risk indicators for interest rate risk when compared to risk tolerances.
As of December 31, 2021, the earnings simulations indicated that the impact of an instantaneous 100 basis point increase / decrease in rates would result in an estimated 9.41% increase (up 100) and 7.58% decrease (down 100) in net interest income.
We use Economic Value of Equity (“EVE”) analysis as an indicator of the extent to which the present value of our capital could change, given potential changes in interest rates. This measure also assumes a static balance sheet (Base Case Scenario) with rate shocks applied as described above. At December 31, 2021, the percentage change in EVE due to a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates was 3.61% and (4.12)%, respectively. The percentage change in EVE due to a 200 basis point increase in interest rates was 6.37%.
Simulation analysis involves the use of several assumptions including, but not limited to, the timing of cash flows such as investment security calls, loan prepayment speeds, deposit attrition rates, the interest rate sensitivity of loans and deposits relative to general market rates, and the behavior of interest rates and spreads. Furthermore, equity at risk simulation uses assumptions regarding discount rates that value cash flows. Simulation analysis is highly dependent on model assumptions that may vary from actual outcomes. For example, higher levels of interest rate sensitivity of deposits to upward movements in interest rates may adversely impact net interest income. Additionally, slower prepayment speeds of loans may adversely impact the economic value of equity in a rising interest rate environment. Key simulation assumptions are subject to stress testing to assess the impact of assumption changes on earnings at risk and equity at risk.
The analysis provided below assumes the base case the Moody’s Baseline forecast as described above. Parallel and sustained interest rate shocks are applied over a one-year time horizon on an instantaneous and ramped basis. Instantaneous shocks assume immediate, sustained interest rate shocks, whereas ramped shocks distribute the assumed change in rates attributable to the shock evenly across the one-year time horizon. This analysis is applied to a static balance sheet that assumes maturing or repricing assets and liabilities are replaced at current market prices and volumes consistent with maintaining a stable balance sheet, with the exception of PPP loans that are not assumed to be replaced. The downward rate shock is subject to product floors and a zero-interest rate.

LIBOR Transition
In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop
persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR at the end of 2021. On March 5, 2021, the FCA confirmed that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021 for the one-week and two-month US dollar settings and immediately after June 30, 2023 for all remaining US dollar settings.
The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has proposed Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as its preferred rate as an alternative to LIBOR and has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR. Organizations are currently working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans related to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. As noted within Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors of the this Form 10-K for the year ended 2021, we hold instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR including floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and hedges, and other financial instruments but is not able to currently predict the associated financial impact of the transition to an alternative reference rate.
We have established a cross-functional LIBOR transition working group that has 1) assessed the Company's current exposure to LIBOR indexed instruments and the data, systems and processes that will be impacted; 2) established a detailed implementation plan; and 3) developed a formal governance structure for the transition. The Company is in the process of developing and implementing various proactive steps to facilitate the transition on behalf of customers, which include:
● The adoption and ongoing implementation of fallback provisions that provide for the determination of replacement rates for LIBOR-linked financial products.
● The adoption of new products linked to alternative reference rates, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, consistent with guidance provided by the U.S. regulators, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, and GSEs.
● The selection of SOFR indices as the replacement indices, and successful completion of systems testing using the SOFR replacement indices.
The Company discontinued quoting LIBOR on September 30, 2021 and discontinued originating new products linked to LIBOR on December 31, 2021.
The Company continues to evaluate its financial and operational infrastructure in its effort to transition all financial and strategic processes, systems, and models to reference rates other than LIBOR. The Company is in the
process of developing and implementing processes to educate client-facing associates and coordinate communications with customers regarding the transition.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had the following exposures to LIBOR:
● Approximately $6.9 billion of total outstanding loans reference LIBOR. Of this amount, $6.3 billion have maturities occurring after the LIBOR discontinuation date of June 30, 2023.
● Approximately $20.8 billion in interest rate swaps that are indexed to LIBOR with a gross positive fair value of $408.8 million and a gross negative fair value of $410.1 million. However, the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements. Therefore, the transition to LIBOR will have no hedge accounting impact as changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings. Moreover, the exposure of both sides of these swaps are presented in these figures. These exposures are intended to offset each other.
● Trust preferred securities that reference LIBOR and had a total principal balance of $118.6 million. These securities have maturities ranging from October 7, 2033 through March 14, 2037.
● Subordinated debt that references LIBOR that had a principal balance of $13 million. This debt matures June 30, 2027 and has an initial call date of June 30, 2022.
Asset Credit Risk and Concentrations
The quality of our interest-earning assets is maintained through our management of certain concentrations of credit risk. We review each individual earning asset including investment securities and loans for credit risk. To facilitate this review, we have established credit and investment policies that include credit limits, documentation, periodic examination, and follow-up. In addition, we examine these portfolios for exposure to concentration in any one industry, government agency, or geographic location.
Loan and Deposit Concentration
We have no material concentration of deposits from any single customer or group of customers. We have no significant portion of our loans concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries. Furthermore, we attempt to avoid making loans that, in an aggregate amount, exceed 10% of total loans to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no aggregated loan concentrations of this type. We do not believe there are any material seasonal factors that would have a material adverse effect on us. We do not have material foreign loans or deposits.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Each category of earning assets has a certain degree of credit risk. We use various techniques to measure credit risk. Credit risk in the investment portfolio can be measured through bond ratings published by independent agencies. In the investment securities portfolio, the investments consist of U.S. government-sponsored entity securities, tax-free securities, or other securities having ratings of “AAA” to “Not Rated”. All securities, with the exception of those that are not rated, were rated by at least one of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. The credit risk of the loan portfolio can be measured by historical experience. We maintain our loan portfolio in accordance with credit policies that we have established. Although the subsidiary has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of their borrowers’ abilities to honor their contracts is dependent upon economic conditions within our geographic footprint and the surrounding regions.
We consider concentrations of credit to exist when, pursuant to regulatory guidelines, the amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by general economic conditions represents 25% of Tier 1 capital plus regulatory adjusted allowance for credit losses of the Company, or $860.6 million at December 31, 2021. Based on this criteria, we had seven such credit concentrations at December 31, 2021, including loans on hotels and motels of $892.6 million, loans to lessors of nonresidential buildings (except mini-warehouses) of $4.7 billion, loans secured by owner occupied office buildings (including medical office buildings) of $1.8 billion, loans secured by owner occupied nonresidential buildings (excluding office buildings) of $1.7 billion, loans to lessors of residential buildings (investment properties and multi-family) of $1.3 billion, loans secured by
1st mortgage 1-4 family owner occupied residential property (including condos and home equity lines) of $4.1 billion and loans secured by jumbo (original loans greater than $548,250) 1st mortgage 1-4 family owner occupied residential property of $1.6 billion. The risk for these loans and for all loans is managed collectively through the use of credit underwriting practices developed and updated over time. The loss estimate for these loans is determined using our standard ACL methodology.
With some financial institutions adopting CECL in the first quarter of 2020, banking regulators established new guidelines for calculating credit concentrations. Banking regulators set the guidelines for construction, land development and other land loans to total less than 100% of total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL (CDL concentration ratio) and for total commercial real estate loans (construction, land development and other land loans along with other non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans) to total less than 300% of total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL (CRE concentration ratio). Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank’s total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL. At December 31, 2021, the Bank’s CDL concentration ratio was 55.2% and its CRE concentration ratio was 238.5%. At December 31, 2020, the Bank’s CDL concentration ratio was 54.1% and its CRE concentration ratio was 229.5%. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bank was below the established regulatory guidelines. When a bank’s ratios are in excess of one or both of these loan concentration ratios guidelines, banking regulators generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank Management. Therefore, we monitor these two ratios as part of our concentration management processes.
Effect of Inflation and Changing Prices
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the measure of financial position and results of operations in terms of historical dollars, without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power over time due to inflation. Unlike most other industries, the majority of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant effect on a financial institution’s performance than does the effect of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily change in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services.
While the effect of inflation on banks is normally not as significant as is its influence on those businesses which have large investments in plant and inventories, it does have an effect. During periods of high inflation, there are normally corresponding increases in money supply, and banks will normally experience above average growth in assets, loans and deposits. Also, general increases in the prices of goods and services will result in increased operating expenses. Inflation also affects our bank’s customers and may result in an indirect effect on our bank’s business.
Contractual Obligations
The following table presents payment schedules for certain of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021. Long-term debt obligations totaling $327.1 million include trust preferred junior subordinated debt and corporate subordinated debt. Operating and finance lease obligations of $140.1 million and $3.2 million, respectively, pertain to banking facilities. Certain lease agreements include payment of property taxes and insurance and contain various renewal options. Additional information regarding leases is contained in Note 21 of the audited consolidated financial statements.
