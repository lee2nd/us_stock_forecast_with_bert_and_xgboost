ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion and analysis may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. We discuss factors that we believe could cause or contribute to these differences below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those set forth under “Part I. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors”.
Overview
Shenandoah Telecommunications Company (“Shentel”, “we”, “our”, “us”, or the “Company”), is a provider of a comprehensive range of broadband communication services and cell tower colocation space in the Mid-Atlantic portion of the United States.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis is organized around our reporting segments. Refer to Item 1 above for our description of our reporting segments and a description of their respective business activities. Also see Note 3, Discontinued Operations, and Note 15, Segment Reporting, in our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
2021 Developments
On July 1, 2021, pursuant to the previously announced Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), dated May 28, 2021, between Shentel and T-Mobile USA, Inc. (“T-Mobile”), Shentel completed the sale to T-Mobile of its Wireless assets and operations for cash consideration of approximately $1.94 billion, inclusive of the approximately $60 million settlement of the waived management fees by Sprint Corporation, an indirect subsidiary of T-Mobile (“Sprint”), and net of certain transaction expenses (the “Transaction”). The Company’s Wireless assets and operations were classified as discontinued operations after Sprint delivered notice to the Company exercising its option to purchase the Wireless assets and operations on August 26, 2020.
Due to the availability of grants awarded under various governmental initiatives, in support of rural fiber to the home ("FTTH") broadband network expansion projects, we ceased further expansion of our fixed wireless edge-out strategy. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company incurred approximately $6.0 million of expenses for impairment of expansionary Beam construction assets. The Company plans to continue to operate the existing Beam network and continue sales and marketing activities to attract new customers; therefore, our remaining Beam assets and operations will continue to be classified as continuing operations.
Our historical results of operations have been retroactively revised to reflect the correction of an immaterial error related to the capitalization of certain customer installation costs for our Broadband segment. These revisions ensure comparability across all periods reflected herein. Refer to Note 1, Nature of Operations, found in our consolidated financial statements contained herein for additional information.
Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020
The Company’s consolidated results from operations are summarized as follows:
Year Ended December 31, Change

Income from discontinued operations, net of tax 990,902 404.1 124,097 56.2 866,805 698.5
Net income $ 998,831 407.3 $ 125,673 56.9 873,158 694.8
Revenue
Revenue increased approximately $24.5 million, or 11.1%, in 2021 compared with 2020, driven by 11.6% growth in Broadband and 3.8% growth in the Tower segments. Refer to the discussion of the results of operations for the Tower and Broadband segments, included within this annual report, for additional information.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses increased approximately $24.3 million, or 10.9%, in 2021 compared with 2020, primarily driven by $7.4 million in incremental Broadband operating expenses incurred to support the continuing expansion of Glo Fiber, $1.7 million of restructuring expenses and $6.0 million of impairment expenses incurred primarily as a result of our decision to cease expansion of Beam, $6.4 million in depreciation from growth in our broadband networks, $5.8 million in Broadband maintenance due primarily to higher cable replacements costs, obsolete inventory charges and expensing of software development costs related to our current ERP system that will be replaced in 2022, partially offset by a decline in corporate expenses.
Other income, net
Other income, net increased $5.5 million primarily due to actuarial gains recognized for the Company's post-retirement benefit plans and transitional service agreement ("TSA") income realized in 2021.
Income tax benefit
Income tax benefit of approximately $1.7 million increased approximately $0.7 million compared with 2020, primarily due to a $5.0 million of non-cash tax benefits derived from the revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities driven by the change in our estimated state tax rate that was triggered by the disposition of our Wireless assets and operations and a change in West Virginia tax regulations, partially offset by a $1.6 million reclassification of income taxes from other comprehensive income as a result of terminating our interest rate swaps, a $1.1 million reduction in excess tax benefits from share based compensation and other and $1.6 million as a result of changes in taxable income.
Income from discontinued operations, net of tax
Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased $0.9 billion, or 698.5%. The increase was primarily due to the completion of the disposition of our Wireless assets and operations for proceeds of approximately $1.9 billion resulting in a gain of $1.2 billion, net of approximately $0.3 billion of income tax expense.
Broadband
Our Broadband segment provides broadband internet, video and voice services to residential and commercial customers in portions of Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky, via hybrid fiber coaxial cable under the brand name of Shentel, fiber optics under the brand name of Glo Fiber and fixed wireless internet service under the brand name of Beam. The Broadband segment also leases dark fiber and provides Ethernet and Wavelength fiber optic services to enterprise and wholesale customers throughout the entirety of our service area. The Broadband segment also provides voice and DSL telephone services to customers in Virginia’s Shenandoah County and portions of adjacent counties as a Rural Local Exchange Carrier (“RLEC”). These integrated networks are connected by over 7,400 fiber route mile network.

(1)Homes and businesses are considered passed (“homes passed”) if we can connect them to our network without further extending the distribution system. Homes passed is an estimate based upon the best available information. Homes passed will vary among video, broadband data and voice services.
(2)Customer relationships represent the number of billed customers who receive at least one of our services.
(3)Penetration is calculated by dividing the number of users by the number of homes passed or available homes, as appropriate.
(4)Average Revenue Per Data RGU calculation = (Residential & SMB Revenue * 1,000) / average data RGUs / 12 months
(5)Total fiber miles are measured by taking the number of fiber strands in a cable and multiplying that number by the route distance. For example, a 10 mile route with 144 fiber strands would equal 1,440 fiber miles.

Broadband operating income $ 28,832 12.6 $ 38,906 19.0 (10,074) (25.9)
Residential & SMB revenue
Residential & SMB revenue increased approximately $22.5 million, or 14.5%, during 2021 primarily driven by launching services in new markets resulting in 15.9% growth in broadband RGUs.
Commercial Fiber revenue
Commercial Fiber revenue increased approximately $2.2 million, or 6.6%, during 2021 due primarily to $1.0 million of growth in circuit connections, $0.7 million non-recurring amortized revenue reduction in 2020 and $0.5 million in non-recurring dark fiber sales-type leases in 2021.
RLEC & Other revenue
RLEC & Other revenue decreased approximately $1.0 million, or 5.7%, compared with 2020 due primarily to a decline in residential DSL subscribers, lower switched access revenue, and lower intercompany phone service. We expect RLEC revenue to continue to decline in future periods as subscribers migrate to faster speed data services provided by our dual-incumbent cable franchise in Shenandoah County, Virginia.
Cost of services
Cost of services increased approximately $12.4 million, or 14.6%, compared with 2020, primarily driven by $5.8 million increase in maintenance due primarily to higher cable replacements costs, obsolete network asset charges and expensing of software development costs related to our current ERP system, $3.6 million in higher compensation costs to support the expansion of Glo Fiber and Beam, and $1.7 million in higher programming fees.
Selling, general and administrative
Selling, general and administrative expense increased $8.4 million or 21.2% compared with 2020 primarily due to $3.8 million in higher compensation and advertising costs to support the expansion of Glo Fiber and Beam, a $2.4 million increase in software development and service fees as we upgrade our operating support, customer relationship and enterprise resource systems and a $1.7 million increase in property taxes, facility expense and other costs.
Restructuring expense
Restructuring expense was primarily due to severance related expenses from the sale of Wireless assets and operations.
Impairment
During the fourth quarter, we ceased further expansion of our fixed wireless edge-out strategy. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company incurred approximately $6.0 million of expenses for impairment of expansionary Beam construction assets.
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization increased $6.9 million or 16.7%, compared with 2020, primarily as a result of our network expansion and the deployment of infrastructure necessary to support our new fiber-to-the-home service, Glo Fiber.
Tower
Our Tower segment owns cell towers and leases colocation space on the towers to wireless communications providers. Substantially all of our owned towers are built on ground that we lease from the respective landlords.
The following table indicates selected operating statistics of the Tower segment:

Tower operating income $ 9,016 50.9 $ 8,823 51.7 193 2.2
Revenue
Revenue increased approximately $0.6 million, or 3.8%, in 2021 compared with 2020. This increase was due to a 13.6% increase in tenants and was partially offset by a 3.2% decline in average revenue per tenant.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses increased approximately $0.5 million compared to the prior year period, due primarily to increases in ground lease rent expense, and expansion of our tower network team resulting in higher payroll costs, partially offset by a decrease in professional services.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019

Net income $ 125,673 56.9 $ 55,500 26.8 70,173 126.4
Revenue
Revenue increased approximately $13.9 million, or 6.7%, in 2020 compared with 2019, driven by 31.3% growth in the Tower and 5.4% growth in Broadband segments. Refer to the discussion of the results of operations for the Tower and Broadband segments, included within this annual report, for additional information.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses increased approximately $15.2 million, or 7.3%, in 2020 compared with 2019, driven by incremental Broadband operating expenses incurred to support the launch of our new fiber-to-the-home service, Glo Fiber, and fixed wireless broadband service, Beam.
Income tax (benefit) expense
Income tax benefit of approximately $1.0 million declined approximately $1.0 million compared with 2019, primarily due to changes in excess tax benefits from stock based compensation and other discrete items.
Income from discontinued operations, net of tax
Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased $70.5 million, or 131.7%. The increase was primarily driven by a $48.5 million decline in depreciation and amortization primarily as a result of ceasing depreciation and amortization of assets held for sale during the third quarter of 2020, $25.3 million increase in wireless service revenue driven by our travel revenue settlement with Sprint, a $12.1 million decline in cost of services due to ceasing amortization on our right of use assets under operating leases during the third quarter of 2020, an $8.8 million decline in interest expense driven by lower interest rates on our term loans, partially offset by $27.5 million of higher income tax.

Residential & SMB revenue
Residential & SMB revenue increased approximately $12.7 million, or 8.9%, during 2020 primarily driven by 22.3% growth in broadband RGUs and penetration improvement.
Commercial Fiber revenue
Commercial Fiber revenue increased approximately $2.3 million, or 7.7%, during 2020 due primarily to an increase in new enterprise and backhaul recurring revenue of $3.9 million partially offset by a decline in amortized upfront fee revenue of $1.6 million.
RLEC & Other revenue
RLEC & Other revenue decreased approximately $4.7 million, or 22.0%, compared with 2019 due primarily to a decline in residential DSL subscribers, lower governmental support, and lower intercompany phone service. We expect RLEC revenue to decline at a slower rate in future periods as subscribers migrate to broadband data services.
Cost of services
Cost of services increased approximately $5.0 million, or 6.3%, compared with 2019, primarily driven by higher compensation expense due to the combination of Glo Fiber and Beam start-up expenses, higher incentive accrual from strong operating results driven by growth in our customer base, and COVID supplemental pay for customer interfacing employees.
Selling, general and administrative
Selling, general and administrative expense increased $5.9 million or 17.7% compared with 2019 primarily due to increases in compensation expense of $3.4 million, primarily as a result of Glo Fiber and Beam fixed wireless start-up costs, higher benefit plan and incentive accruals from strong operating results and $2.8 million of higher software and professional fees.
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization increased $2.5 million or 6.5%, compared with 2019, primarily as a result of our network expansion and the deployment of infrastructure necessary to support new fiber-to-the-home service, Glo Fiber, and fixed wireless solution, Beam.
Tower
Tower results from operations are summarized as follows:
Year Ended December 31, Change
($ in thousands) 2020 % of Revenue 2019 % of Revenue $ %
Tower revenue $ 17,055 100.0 $ 12,985 100.0 4,070 31.3

Tower operating income $ 8,823 51.7 $ 6,295 48.5 2,528 40.2
Revenue
Revenue increased approximately $4.1 million, or 31.3%, in 2020 compared with 2019. This increase was due to a 5.7% increase in tenants and a 23.4% increase in average revenue per tenant driven by amendments to intercompany leases.
Revenue derived from our wireless operations was approximately $14.0 million and $10.0 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses increased approximately $1.5 million compared to the prior year period, due primarily to increases in ground lease rent expense and professional services.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources and Uses of Cash: Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and proceeds available under our Credit Agreement.
As of December 31, 2021 our cash and cash equivalents totaled $84.3 million and the availability under our delayed draw term loans and revolving line of credit was $400.0 million, for total available liquidity of $484.3 million.
Operating activities from continuing operations generated approximately $63.5 million in 2021, representing an increase of $10.1 million compared with 2020, driven by higher income from continuing operations offset by changes in working capital.
Operating activities from discontinued operations resulted in a cash outflow of $314.4 million as compared to cash inflows of $249.5 million in 2020 due primarily to approximately $434 million of income tax payments paid on the gain from the 2021 disposition of our Wireless assets and operations and due to the fact that the Wireless business was generating cash flow for the Company for a full year in 2020, compared to only six months in 2021.
Net cash used in investing activities for continuing operations increased $21.6 million in 2021, compared with 2020, primarily due to $39.7 million increase in capital expenditures for our Broadband segment to enable our Glo Fiber and Beam market expansions, and partially offset by a $16.1 million decline in payments made for spectrum licenses.
Proceeds received from the July 1, 2021, disposition of our Wireless assets and operations ("the transaction") or, net cash provided by investing activities for discontinued operations, were approximately $1.9 billion. The Company used the after-tax proceeds from the sale of our Wireless assets and operations to:
•Repay and terminate approximately $684 million of outstanding term loans under our "Prior Credit Agreement", and associated interest rate swap liabilities, concurrent with the closing of the disposition;
•Issue a special dividend of $18.75 per share to Company shareholders, or approximately $937 million in the aggregate (the "Special Dividend").
•Pay approximately $434 million in income taxes on the transaction in December 2021.
The transaction was accounted for as an asset sale for income tax purposes. Cash proceeds from the sale were required to be used to immediately repay our outstanding indebtedness; all principal payments on our debt were therefore presented as cash used to finance our discontinued operations.
Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations increased approximately $0.9 billion primarily due to the payment of the Special Dividend following the Wireless sale.
Net cash used in financing activities for discontinued operations increased $0.7 billion to due repayment of debt under our Prior Credit Agreement in 2021.
Indebtedness: On July 1, 2021, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with various financial institutions party thereto. The Credit Agreement provides for the following three credit facilities (collectively, the “Facilities”), in an aggregate amount equal to $400 million: (i) a $100 million five-year revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”), (ii) a $150 million five-year delayed draw amortizing term loan (the “Term Loan A-1”) and (iii) a $150 million seven-year delayed draw amortizing term loan (the “Term Loan A-2” and, together with the Term Loan A-1, the “Term Loans”). The Credit Agreement includes a provision under which the Company may request that additional term loans be made to it in an amount not to exceed the sum of (1) the greater of (a) $75 million and (b) 100% of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement), calculated on a pro forma basis in accordance with the Credit Agreement, plus (2) an additional unlimited amount subject to a maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 4.00:1.00, calculated on a pro forma basis in accordance with the Credit Agreement, subject to the receipt of commitments from one or more lenders for any such additional term loans and other customary conditions.
The availability of the Facilities to the Company is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Company may use the proceeds from the Revolver and the Term Loans to finance capital expenditures, provide working capital, and for other general corporate purposes, including but not limited to, funding any underfunded amounts of the nTelos pension plan to enable its termination, of the Company and its subsidiaries. If drawn on, the Term Loans are required to be repaid in quarterly principal installments commencing on September 30, 2023, with the unpaid balance of the Term Loans due at maturity, as set forth in the Credit Agreement.
We have not made any borrowings under the Credit Agreement as of this date. We expect to start drawing against the Credit Agreement in first quarter of 2022, with additional borrowings occurring as needed to fund the Company's future capital expenditures. We expect to draw $300 million against the Credit Agreement by June 2023.
We expect our cash on hand, cash flow from continuing operations, and availability of funds from our Credit Agreement, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for business operations for the next twelve months. There can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to raise additional financing to support the Company's planned capital expenditures aimed at growth and expansion.
We expect our capital expenditures to exceed the cash flow provided from continuing operations through 2025, as we shift our focus to expand our broadband network to support the launch of Glo Fiber to our newly targeted markets covering over 450,000 homes passed.
The actual amount and timing of our future capital requirements may differ materially from our estimates depending on the demand for our products and services, new market developments and expansion opportunities.
Our cash flows from continuing operations could be adversely affected by events outside our control, including, without limitation, changes in overall economic conditions, regulatory requirements, changes in technologies, changes in competition, demand for our products and services, availability of labor resources and capital, natural disasters, pandemics and outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments, such as COVID-19, and other conditions. Our ability to attract and maintain a sufficient customer base, particularly in our Broadband markets, is critical to our ability to maintain a positive cash flow from operations. The foregoing events individually or collectively could affect our results.
Critical Accounting Policies
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as related disclosures. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or operating results would be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below.
Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements. The following are the accounting policies that we believe involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity and are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
Revenue Recognition
Our Broadband segment provides broadband data, video and voice services to residential and commercial customers in portions of Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky, via fiber optic, hybrid fiber coaxial cable, and fixed wireless networks. The Broadband segment also provides voice and DSL telephone services to customers in Virginia’s Shenandoah County and portions of adjacent counties as a Rural Local Exchange Carrier (“RLEC”). Our service contracts are generally cancellable at the customer’s discretion without penalty at any time. We allocate the total transaction price in these transactions based upon the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service. We generally recognize these revenues over time as customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits of the service, with the exception of equipment sales and home wiring, which are recognized as revenue at a point in time when control transfers and when installation is complete, respectively. Installation fees, charged upfront without transfer of commensurate goods or services to the customer, are allocated to services and are recognized ratably over the longer of the contract term or the period in which the unrecognized fee remains material to the contract, which we estimate to be about one year. Additionally, the Company incurs commission costs which are capitalized and amortized over the expected weighted average customer life which is approximately six years.
Our Broadband segment also provides Ethernet and Wavelength fiber optic services to enterprise and carrier customers under capacity agreements, and the related revenue is recognized over time. In some cases, non-refundable upfront fees are charged for connecting enterprise or carrier customers to our fiber network. Those amounts are recognized ratably over the longer of the contract term or the period in which the unrecognized fee remains material to the respective contract.
The Broadband segment also leases dedicated fiber optic strands to customers as part of “dark fiber” agreements, which are accounted for as leases under ASC 842 Leases ("ASC 842").
Our Tower segment leases space on owned cell towers to our Broadband segment, and to other wireless carriers. Revenue from these leases is accounted for under ASC 842.
