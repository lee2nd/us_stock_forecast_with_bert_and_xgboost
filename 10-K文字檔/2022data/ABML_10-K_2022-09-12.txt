Overview
ABTC is a startup company in the lithium-ion battery industry that is working to increase the domestic US production of battery materials, such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese through its engagement in the exploration of new primary resources of battery metals, in the development and commercialization of new technologies for the extraction of these battery metals from primary resources, and in the commercialization of an internally developed integrated process for the recycling of lithium-ion batteries. Through this three-pronged approach ABTC is working to both increase the domestic production of these battery materials, and to ensure that as these materials reach their end of lives that the constituent elemental battery metals are returned to the domestic manufacturing supply chain in a closed-loop fashion.
To implement this business strategy, the Company is currently constructing its first integrated lithium-ion battery recycling facility, which will take in waste and end-of-life battery materials from the electric vehicle, stationary storage, and consumer electronics industries. The construction, commissioning, and operations of this facility are of the highest priority to the company, and as such it has significantly increased the resources devoted to its execution including the further internal hiring of technical staff, expansion of laboratory facilities, and purchasing of equipment. The Company has been awarded a competitively bid grant from the US Advanced Battery Consortium to accelerate the development and demonstration of this pre-commercial scale integrated lithium-ion battery recycling facility.
Additionally, the Company is accelerating the demonstration and commercialization of its internally developed low-cost and low-environmental impact processing train for the manufacturing of battery grade lithium hydroxide from Nevada-based sedimentary claystone resources. The Company has been awarded a grant cooperative agreement from the US Department of Energy Advanced Manufacturing Office through the Critical Materials Innovation program to support the construction and operation of a multi-ton per day integrated continuous demonstration system to support the scale-up and commercialization of these technologies.

The Company recognized $33.7 million of operating expenses compared to $37.7 million of operating expenses during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Research and development expenses for the fiscal year include salaries for laboratory staff, laboratory costs, and lease expenses for the laboratory space occupied at NCAR at the University of Nevada, Reno. The Company incurred $1.1 million and $0.9 million in research and development expenses for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively. The Company was awarded two grants in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Income received from these grants was $0.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. The Company records any grant revenue as an offset to research and development expenses.

The Company recognized general and administrative expenses of $31.7 and $36.3 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Included within general and administrative expenses is a non-cash expense related to shares issued for professional services of $20.4 million and $29.4 million during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company has significantly reduced the use of shares for professional services to non-employees therefore, we expect to see a reduction in these expenses beginning July 1, 2022.
Exploration costs consist primarily of expenses related to the salaries, leasing and drill operations primarily associated with the exploration of new primary resources of battery metals. The Company recognized exploration costs of $0.9 million and $0.5 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The increase in cash is due to the Company having received net proceeds of $40.9 million from private placements and share purchases of common stock and $0.9 million of proceeds from exercises of share purchase warrants, partially offset by higher acquisition costs of property and equipment and intangible assets. The increase in total assets was due to the increase in cash of $16.1 million and increase in property and equipment and intangible assets of $13.4 million relating to additional acquisitions of land, construction in progress, equipment and water rights which will be used for the Company’s future pilot plant operations.
Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)
The Company had total current liabilities of $3.1 million at June 30, 2022, compared to $1.8 million at June 30, 2021. The increase in current liabilities is due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities based on increased expenses in investing activities, an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and day-to-day operating expenses.
As of June 30, 2022, the Company had working capital of $26.8 million compared to a working capital of $12.3 million at June 30, 2021. The increase in working capital was primarily attributed to the inflow of financing activity during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
Cash Flows
Cash from Operating Activities.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the Company used $10.2 million of cash for operating activities as compared to $7.8 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. The increase in the use of cash for operating activities was due to an increase in operating activities in the current period including an increase in a number of expenses including, employment and recruiting, research and development, exploration and reclamation, and professional fees and services.
Cash from Investing Activities
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the Company used $15.1 million on the construction, procurement of equipment, and water rights necessary to construct, commission, and operate its lithium-ion battery recycling Pilot Plant. This is in comparison to the cash used of $7.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. The increase in investing activities is due to the Company continuing to construct its Pilot Plant where necessary demonstrations are to occur. The Company also continues its acquisition of water rights and land in the Northern Nevada region to support further operations of the Company. The Company expects to see additional increases in investing activities as these projects progress to meet management expectations.
