The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes thereto.
Overview
Business Overview
Since 2016, the focus of our business has been to build crude oil distillation units and refining facilities (CDUs) in the Permian Basin in West Texas. We revised our business plan in 2021 to move MMEX to clean energy production, leveraging our history, management and business relationships from the traditional energy sector.
Since 2021 MMEX has expanded its focus to the development, financing, construction and operation of clean fuels infrastructure projects powered by renewable energy. We have formed two operating sub-divisions of the Company - one sub-division to transition from legacy refining transportation fuels by producing them as ultra clean fuels with carbon capture or as stand-alone renewable or clean fuels projects, and the second sub-division which plans to produce green and/or blue hydrogen with the option for conversion of hydrogen to ammonia or methanol. These two sub-divisions will be operating respectively as Clean Energy Global, LLC and Hydrogen Global, LLC. The planned projects are designed to be powered by solar and wind renewable energy.
Through April 30, 2022, we have had no revenues and have reported continuing losses from operations.
Results of Operations
We recorded a net loss of $228,730 or $(0.02) per share, for fiscal year ended April 30, 2022, compared to a net loss of $24,526,886 or $(14.23) per share, for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021. As discussed below, the net income or loss for any fiscal year fluctuates materially due to non-operating gains and losses.
Revenues
We have not yet begun to generate revenues.
General and Administrative Expenses
Our general and administrative expenses increased $426,201 to $1,293,672 for the year ended April 30, 2022 from $867,471 for the year ended April 30, 2021. The increase resulted from higher professional fee costs, which included increased costs for legal, public relations, and consulting services.
Project Costs
Our project costs increased $1,458,609 to $1,637,742 for the year ended April 30, 2022 from $179,133 for the year ended April 30, 2021. The levels of spending on our projects will vary from period to period based on availability of financing and will be expensed as project costs are incurred. During the year ended April 30, 2022, we obtained financing and were able to move forward on our projects, which included incurring costs for the acquisition of rights, planning, design and permitting.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense
Our depreciation and amortization expenses remained constant, totaling $35,877 and $34,875 for the years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The expense results from the depreciation of land improvements and amortization of land easements.
Other Income (Expense)
Our interest expense decreased $625,711 to $517,784 for the year ended April 30, 2022 from $1,143,495 for the year ended April 30, 2021. We entered into fewer convertible debt arrangements in the current fiscal year, resulting in less amortization of debt discount to interest expense, and our debt arrangements during the year ended April 30, 2022 had more favorable interest rates, thus explaining the decrease in interest expense over time.
For the years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, we reported gains (losses) on derivative liabilities of $3,010,042 and $(22,906,922), respectively. In a series of subscription agreements, we issued warrants in prior years that contained certain anti-dilution provisions that we have identified as derivatives. We also identified the variable conversion feature of certain convertible notes payable as derivatives. We estimated the fair value of the derivatives using multinomial lattice models that value the warrants based on a probability weighted cash flow model using projections of the various potential outcomes. These estimates are based on multiple inputs, including the market price of our stock, interest rates, our stock price volatility and management’s estimates of various potential equity financing transactions. These inputs are subject to significant changes from period to period and to management's judgment; therefore, the estimated fair value of the derivative liabilities will fluctuate from period to period, and the fluctuation may be material. During the year ended April 30, 2022 all derivative liabilities were written off the books, resulting in a larger gain in the current period than in the prior period.
We reported a gain on extinguishment of debt of $243,303 for the year ended April 30, 2022 compared to a gain on extinguishment of debt of $605,010 for the year ended April 30, 2021. The gain on extinguishment of debt generally results from the settlement and extinguishment of convertible notes payable and certain accounts payable and accrued expenses and can fluctuate over time as we are able to settle or pay off debt.
Net Income (Loss)
As a result of the above, we reported net losses of $228,730 and $24,526,886 for the years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Working Capital
As of April 30, 2022, we had current assets of $184,200, comprised of cash of $136,867 and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $47,333, and current liabilities of $3,054,377, resulting in a working capital deficit of $2,870,177.
Sources and Uses of Cash
Our sources and uses of cash for the years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:

Going Concern Uncertainty
Our financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplate the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have incurred continuous losses from operations, have an accumulated deficit of $68,213,423 and a total stockholders’ deficit of $1,755,980 at April 30, 2022, and have reported negative cash flows from operations since inception. In addition, as of April 30, 2022 we did not have the cash resources to meet our operating commitments for the next twelve months. We require capital investments to implement our business plan, including the development of our planned hydrogen projects. Additionally, our ability to continue as a going concern must be considered in light of the problems, expenses and complications frequently encountered by entrance into established markets and the competitive environment in which we operate.
We expect to continue to seek additional funding through private or public equity and debt financing. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our cash needs and/or to raise funds to finance ongoing operations and repay debt. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to raise additional debt or equity capital and/or that our cash generated by our operations will be adequate to meet our needs. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any uncertainty as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements also do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, financing operations, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
For further information on our significant accounting policies see the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. There were no material changes to our significant accounting policies during the year ended April 30, 2022 and there are no policies we deem to be critical accounting policies.
