Item 7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion and analysis together with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expected financial position, business and financing plans. These statements involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Report, particularly under the headings "Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors”.
Overview
The Company is a diversified holding company with subsidiaries engaged in the designing, manufacturing and marketing of highly-engineered, high reliability frequency and spectrum control products used to control the frequency or timing of signals in electronic circuits, and in the design of high performance Frequency and Time Reference Standards that form the basis for timing and synchronization in various applications. The Company’s primary markets are aerospace and defense.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its majority-owned subsidiaries except its sole variable interest entity (“VIE”), LGL Systems Acquisition Holding Company, LLC (the “Sponsor”). The VIE, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, served as the sponsor to a special purpose acquisition company, LGL Systems Acquisition Corp. (the “SPAC” or “DFNS”). The SPAC completed a merger with its target company, IronNet Cybersecurity, Inc., on August 26, 2021 and changed its name to IronNet, Inc. (“IronNet” or “IRNT”) (the “IronNet Business Combination”). IronNet is a publicly-traded company on the NYSE American (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “IRNT.”
Results of Operations
Factors Which May Influence Results of Operations
We are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, other than the global economic conditions affecting our industry generally, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on our revenues or income other than those listed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic (“COVID”) has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance, as well as on the operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve. The COVID pandemic continues to present business challenges, and we continue to experience impacts related to COVID, primarily in higher raw material prices, disruptions in global supply chains, delays in supplier deliveries, delays in deliveries to customers, travel restrictions, quarantine restrictions, labor shortages and employee absences.
As a result of COVID, the Company’s operations in India were closed on March 23, 2020 and resumed limited operations on May 7, 2020 with a reduced level of staffing. By the end of June 2020, the Company’s India facilities were fully operational. Post COVID revenue and bookings declined; and cost saving measures were taken.
In accordance with the Department of Defense guidance issued in March 2020 designating the Defense Industrial Base as a critical infrastructure workforce, our U.S. production facilities have continued to operate in support of essential products and services required to meet national security commitments to the U.S. Government and the U.S. military; however, facility closures or work slowdowns or temporary stoppages have occurred and could occur in the future. In addition, other countries have different practices and policies that can affect our international operations and the operations of our suppliers and customers.
The ultimate impact of COVID on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited to, duration of the pandemic, potential subsequent waves of COVID infection or potential new variants, the effectiveness and adoption of COVID vaccines and therapeutics, governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic (including shutdown orders, border closings, restrictions on travel and transport and workplace restrictions) and resulting supplier impacts. In addition, to the extent global vaccination programs do not achieve intended results and
a longer period of economic and global supply chain and related disruption continues, the more adverse the impact will be on our business operations, financial performance and results of operations.
2021 Compared to 2020
Consolidated Revenues, Gross Margin and Backlog
Total revenues were $28,140,000, a decrease of $3,022,000, or 9.7%, from $31,162,000 in 2020. The decrease in revenue reflects a significant decline in shipments to the avionics market during the COVID pandemic partially offset by strong space business performance. The comparison also reflects first quarter of 2020 pre-COVID conditions.
Consolidated gross margin, which is consolidated revenues less manufacturing cost of sales as a percentage of revenues, improved to 35.8% compared to 35.1% for the prior year. Gross margins improved over last year but were muted by inflationary cost pressures. The margin improvement was from favorable mix and cost reductions, including the elimination of certain previously required redundancies to preserve manufacturing capabilities in response to the COVID impacts on our business. The Company’s India operations were shut down for over six weeks during 2020 requiring onshoring of production to U.S. factories, resulting in increased production costs. As LGL is an essential business, we maintained our production and operations, to support our customer requirements.
As of December 31, 2021, our order backlog was $29,797,000, an increase of 50.5% compared to $19,801,000 as of December 31, 2020. Strong bookings of $38,136,000 following depressed 2020 orders, after the rapid falloff from avionics and other related COVID pandemic issues, drove the improvement. Current year bookings reflect the recovering avionics market and strong defense orders including a fourth quarter 2021 $6.3 million order related to a major missile defense program, most of which is expected to ship subsequent to 2022. The backlog of unfilled orders includes amounts based on signed contracts as well as agreed letters of intent, which we have determined are firm orders likely to be fulfilled primarily in the next 12 months.
Order backlog is adjusted quarterly to reflect project cancellations, deferrals, revised project scope and cost, and sales of subsidiaries, if any. We expect to fill a substantial portion of our order backlog as of December 31, 2021 in 2022, but cannot provide assurances as to what portion of the order backlog will be fulfilled in a given year.
Operating (Loss) Income
The Company reported an operating loss of ($786,000). Operating income, without the $1,318,000 non-cash charitable donation of IRNT common stock, was $532,000 compared to operating income of $1,415,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease reflects the lower revenues, inflationary pressures and $200,000 of Spin-Off costs incurred during 2021 somewhat offset by the above-described profitability improvements and lower non-cash stock-based compensation costs of $377,000. Engineering, selling and administrative expenses were 38.6% (33.9% excluding the charitable donation) of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 30.5% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Gain (Loss) on Equity Investment in Unconsolidated Subsidiary
The Company recognized a gain on equity investment in unconsolidated subsidiary of $59,453,000 compared to a loss of ($262,000) for the year ended December 31, 2020. As more fully described below in the Non-Recurring Items: Equity Investment in Unconsolidated Subsidiary section, the substantial increase reflects the impact of the IronNet Business Combination and subsequent Sponsor distribution of IRNT securities. The fair value of IRNT securities determined at the date of distribution represents the basis of these securities in determining realized and unrealized (losses) and gains.
Realized (Loss) Income on Marketable Securities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the realized loss on marketable securities was ($16,962,000) compared to $74,000 of realized income for the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the realized loss related to the disposition of IRNT common stock and related derivative positions of $17,377,000, investment income improved to $415,000 compared to $74,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. See Note D - Marketable Securities in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details.
Unrealized (Loss) Gain on Marketable Securities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, unrealized loss on marketable securities was ($22,949,000). Excluding the unrealized loss of ($22,834,000) from the change in fair value of the Company’s IRNT common stock and derivative positions held at December 31, 2021, the unrealized loss of ($155,000) compared to a $139,000 unrealized gain for the year ended December 31, 2020. See Note D - Marketable Securities in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details.
Investment gains and losses have caused and are expected to continue to cause significant volatility in our earnings, particularly with respect to our IRNT securities position.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net was $11,000 compared to ($51,000) for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflecting currency changes.
Income Tax Provision
We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, tax benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to the tax provision in a subsequent period.
During 2021, the Company released its $379,000 valuation allowance over a portion of its deferred tax assets as the deferred tax assets became more likely than not to be realized given the expected gains on IRNT share sales. We recorded a tax expense of $4,118,000 and $336,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The substantially higher tax expense was driven by the gain from our Sponsor investment as a result of the IronNet Business Combination, and an increase in the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits, but was partly offset by the tax benefit from the reduction of the Company’s previously recorded valuation allowance.
Net Income
Net income was $14,638,000 compared to $968,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was from the aforementioned gain from our Sponsor investment as a result of the IronNet Business Combination, partially offset by realized and unrealized accounting losses in IRNT-related securities through December 31, 2021. Basic net income per share for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $2.77 and $0.19, respectively. Diluted net income per share for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $2.74 and $0.19, respectively.
Non-Recurring Items: Equity Investment in Unconsolidated Subsidiary
The Company invested $6.1 million in LGL Systems Acquisition Holdings, LLC, the Sponsor of LGL Systems Acquisition Corp., a NYSE-listed SPAC trading under the symbol “DFNS” which later completed a business combination with IronNet Cybersecurity, Inc. and began trading on the NYSE under the symbol “IRNT”. On September 14, 2021, the Company received 1,572,529 shares of IRNT common stock and 2,065,000 IRNT private warrants, as part of the Sponsor’s distribution to certain of its members, with an aggregate fair value of $65.3 million on the date of distribution. Of these shares of common stock, 1,300,000 shares were restricted from sale for at least six months from the date of closing and subject to the applicable shareholder lock-up agreements. In an effort to continue its stakeholder responsibilities in the context of global corporate citizenship, the Company made a charitable gift on September 28, 2021 of 50,000 of these restricted shares of IRNT stock, leaving a balance of 1,250,000 shares of restricted common stock at December 31, 2021. In October 2021, the Company received 1,271,406 shares of IRNT common stock from a cashless exercise of its private warrants.
Prior to the distribution on September 14, 2021, the Company reported its original $6.1 million investment in the Sponsor under the equity method of accounting, recognizing a cumulative Sponsor gain of $59.5 million since its initial 2019 investment which included the $65.3 million investment value increase from the Sponsor’s receipt of IRNT securities. After the Sponsor’s distribution, the Company’s IRNT securities have been classified as marketable securities, with the change in fair value reported as realized and unrealized losses.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company sold 1,455,315 shares of its IRNT common stock partially monetizing its $6.1 million Sponsor investment. Proceeds of $18.5 million from the sale of these shares and the closing of certain IRNT-related derivative transactions were received. At December 31, 2021, we held 1,338,620 shares of IRNT common stock in our portfolio of which 300,000 shares were hedged and in the money. In addition, as a result of the tax gain on the IRNT share sales, the Company was able to utilize nearly all of its net operating loss carryforwards along with a significant portion of its tax credit carryforward to reduce federal and state taxes payable by approximately $2.5 million.
The favorable impact of the Sponsor investment increased the Company’s 2021 other income by $19.3 million consisting of a $59.5 million gain on equity investment and a $40.2 loss on the change in fair value of IRNT securities since the Sponsor distribution ($17.4 million realized and $22.8 million unrealized). This reflects mark to market accounting treatment in determining the fair value of the Company’s membership interest at distribution and IRNT marketable securities and not the actual realized economic return on our $6.1 million investment in the Sponsor of the SPAC. SPACs characteristically exhibit significant stock price volatility from a shortage of tradeable shares coupled with post-merger derivative transactions, and so we expect significant volatility in our reported earnings as we mark to market our remaining IronNet holdings until they are sold. An independent committee of the Board was established to oversee the orderly liquidation of the investment. The Company has put options for 300,000 IRNT common shares with a strike price of $8 remaining in its portfolio as of December 31, 2021.
Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis, the Company used certain non-GAAP measures as presented in the following Non-GAAP proforma Statements of Operations. The Non-GAAP statements have been prepared to exclude transactions associated with our investment in the Sponsor (collectively the “Sponsor Transactions”). The Sponsor Transactions include: 1) the Company’s third quarter 2021 $1,318,000 non-cash donation of 50,000 shares of IRNT common stock, 2) $59,453,000 gain on equity investment in unconsolidated subsidiary for the year ended December 31, 2021, 3) ($17,377,000) realized loss on the 2021 disposition of IRNT common stock and related derivatives and 4) ($22,834,000) unrealized loss on the mark to market of IRNT-related securities held at December 31, 2021. The Sponsor Transactions include the ($262,000) loss on equity investment in unconsolidated subsidiary for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, cash and cash equivalents were $29,016,000 and $18,331,000, respectively. The $18,548,000 of proceeds from the sale of IRNT-related securities drove the significant increase in cash and cash equivalents.
Cash provided by operating activities was $1,352,000 and $3,192,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The $1,840,000 decrease was largely due to the lower operating earnings and changes in receivable and inventory levels in 2021 as compared to 2020.
Cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $9,406,000 and ($428,000), respectively. The increase reflects $18,548,000 of proceeds from the sale of IRNT common stock and related derivatives partly offset by the purchase of $5,318,000 of marketable securities and the $2,725,000 funding for the Company’s Sponsor investment for its private placement subscription in connection with the IronNet Business Combination. Increased capital expenditures, $1,099,000 in 2021 versus $407,000 in 2020, were for investment in production equipment to improve cost and efficiency.
Cash (used in) provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was ($73,000) and $3,114,000, respectively. In 2020, the Company sold securities under its ATM Offering of $3,254,000 and incurred costs related to the issuance of common stock warrants of $202,000. In 2021, Company payments related to net share settlement of equity awards exceeded funds received from the exercise of stock options by $73,000.
As of December 31, 2021, our consolidated working capital was $51,410,000, compared to $30,384,000 as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had current assets of $55,836,000, current liabilities of $4,426,000 and a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of 12.62 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2020, we had current assets of $33,781,000, current liabilities of $3,397,000 and a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of 9.94 to 1.00. Management continues to focus on efficiently managing working capital requirements to match operating activity levels and will seek to deploy the Company’s working capital where it will generate the greatest returns.
We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our ongoing working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months from the date of this filing. The Company’s management continues to strive for profitability both internally and through acquisition.
See Note I - Revolving Credit Agreement and Note K - Stockholders’ Equity in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the revolving credit agreement and the ATM Offering.
Our Board has adhered to a practice of not paying cash dividends. This policy takes into account our long-term growth objectives, including our anticipated investments for organic growth, potential acquisitions or other strategic ventures and stockholders' desire for capital appreciation of their holdings. No cash dividends have been paid to the Company's stockholders since January 30, 1989, and none are expected to be paid for the foreseeable future.
Spin-Off
In late 2021, the Company’s Board approved progressing with the Spin-Off (as defined below) of MtronPTI. Completion of the Spin-Off is subject to a number of conditions, including stockholder approval of the transaction. If approved by the Company’s stockholders, the Spin-Off will separate the business activities and investments of the Company and create two separate, publicly-traded companies: (1) the Company, which will continue to own and operate PTF and hold substantially all the Company’s cash and marketable securities, and (2) MtronPTI, which includes the operations of Piezo Technology, Inc. and M-tron Asia, LLC (the “Spin-Off”). If completed, upon effectiveness of the transaction, LGL stockholders would own shares of both companies.
Management believes that, if completed, the Spin-Off of MtronPTI would enable shareholders to more clearly evaluate the performance and future potential of each entity on a standalone basis, while allowing each entity to pursue its own distinct business strategy and capital allocation policy. Separating MtronPTI as an independent, publicly owned company positions both MtronPTI and LGL Group to create value for their respective shareholders. The Spin-Off would permit each company to tailor its strategic plans and growth opportunities, more efficiently raise and allocate resources, including capital raised through debt or equity offerings, flexibly use its own stock as currency for incentive compensation and potential acquisitions and provide investors a more targeted investment opportunity.
See Note R - Spin-Off of MtronPTI in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of the transaction.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described Note B - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary. The accounting policies described below are those that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and, therefore, are critical to understanding our results of operations.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 “Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”), which requires an asset and liability approach for the financial accounting and reporting of income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. These balances are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the year(s) in which these temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred income taxes is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted.
Based on consideration of all available evidence regarding their utilization, we record net deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized. Where, based on the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some amount of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, we establish a valuation allowance for the amount that, in our judgment, is sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In reaching such conclusions, we consider available positive and negative evidence including past operating results, projections of future taxable income, the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards. Our projections of future taxable income include estimates and assumptions regarding our income and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences.
We account for unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with ASC 740, which prescribes a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized. The minimum threshold is defined as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based solely on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
As a result of the tax gain on the IRNT share sales in 2021, the Company was able to utilize nearly all of its net operating loss carryforwards along with a significant portion of its tax credit carryforward prior to their expiration reducing 2021 federal and state taxes payable by approximately $2.5 million. We had a valuation allowance of $379,000 at the year ended December 31, 2020; however, this was reversed in 2021 given the significant change in our taxable income assumption from IRNT share sales.
Inventories
We account for inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method.
Inventory reserves are determined based on estimated losses that result from inventory that becomes obsolete or for which the Company has excess inventory levels. In determining these estimates, the Company performs an analysis on current demand and usage for each inventory item over historical time periods. Based on that analysis, the Company reserves a percentage of the inventory amount within each time period based on historical demand and usage patterns of specific items in inventory. Actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to inventory valuation in future periods.
