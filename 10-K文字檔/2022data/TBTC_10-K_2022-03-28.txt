Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this filing.
CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Some of the statements made in this report are “forward-looking statements,” as that term is defined under Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements describe future expectations, plans, results or strategies and can often be identified by the use of terminology such as “may,” “will,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “expect” and similar expressions. The forward-looking statements in this report are primarily located in the material set forth under the headings “Description of Business,” “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” but are found in other parts of this report as well. These statements are based upon management’s current expectations, assumptions and estimates and are not guarantees of timing, future results or performance. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in these statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties and other important factors, including those described in this report under Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” as well as in our other SEC filings. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and, except for our ongoing obligations under the U.S. federal securities laws, we undertake no and expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise
Industry data and other statistical information used in this report are based on independent publications, government publications, reports by market research firms or other published independent sources. Some data are also based on our good faith estimates, derived from our review of internal surveys and the independent sources listed above. Although we believe these sources are reliable, we have not independently verified the information.
Due to the length of the pandemic caused by the coronavirus in the U.S. and globally, our customers have been and may continue to be impacted. The impact of the coronavirus on our future results could be significant and will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus, the success of actions taken to contain or treat the coronavirus, and reactions by consumers, companies, governmental entities and capital markets. It is possible we will have collection issues or customer concessions as a result.
BACKLOG
The Company’s backlog generally consists of incomplete system installations and expansion of offerings for currently installed and supported systems.
The Company had two projects in its backlog at December 31, 2020. The Company had five projects in its backlog as of December 31, 2021. As of the filing date of this report, the Company has four signed new contracts with customers in 2022.
The Company is currently serving gaming establishments in fourteen states in the U.S., as well as countries in Central and South America, the Caribbean and Australia. The Company aims to pursue further opportunities and strategic partnerships.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Management believes that the Company has adequate cash to meet its obligations and continue operations for both existing customer contracts and ongoing product development for at least the next 12 months from the date of this filing. The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash, receivables, and future cash generated from operations.
In February 2020, the Company obtained a $500,000 line of credit with a lender. As of December 31, 2021, no amount was outstanding. The line of credit expires on February 1, 2023. In February 2021, we applied and were approved for a second draw in the amount of $473,400 of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan through the Small Business Administration. This loan allowed us to continue to employ all existing employees to service our client base. The Company's PPP loan was forgiven by the SBA in the amount of $473,400 in October 2021. Management is not aware of any trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in the registrant’s liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.
The Company’s cash position at December 31, 2021 was $4,945,913, an increase of $3,214,044 from $1,731,869 at December 31, 2020. Net cash flows provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 were approximately $2,797,644 compared to cash used by operating activities of $5,293 for the same period in 2020. This increase of $2,802,937 was primarily due to an increase in income from operations and customers deposits.
Net cash used in investing activities was $57,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $0 for the same period in 2020. This increase of $57,000 was due purchase of an investment in 2021 and no such expenditures during 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, based on ceased operating activity of the investee, the Company determined the investment was impaired and recorded an investment loss of $57,000.
Net cash provided in financing activities was $473,400 during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The company received funds from a PPP loan in both years.
On December 31, 2021, total stockholders’ equity was $6,527,358 compared to $4,693,493 in 2020, an increase of $1,833,865 or 39.1%, which was primarily due to 2021 net income.
The Company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2021.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, YEAR ENDED December 31, 2021 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED December 31, 2020
The most significant events that affected the 2021 results of operations were the Company’s installation of ten casino management systems, expanded one existing customer and our exclusive supplier installed our system in multiple new locations in Australia.
Revenue
See Note 1: Revenue, disaggregated revenues by major product line table
Total revenues increased $2,565,242, a 58.3% increase, due to more installations in 2021 compared to 2020 as a result of the easing of limitations related to the COVID-19 pandemic. System sales increased $1,459,799, an 90% increase, due to the smaller amount of systems that were installed in 2021 compared to 2020. Maintenance revenue increased $506,259, a 19% increase, due to an increase in COVID-19 related customer credits issued during 2020. Service and other revenue, which includes DataTrac, promotional kiosk software sales and licensing agreements increased $386,526, as a result of an increase in DataTrac services and promotional kiosk products being sold.
During 2021, the Company delivered a total of ten systems and expanded one system in the United States. Our exclusive supplier installed our system in multiple new locations in Australia. During 2020, the Company delivered 10 systems.
Cost of Sales and Gross Profit
Cost of sales increased to $1,895,733 in 2021 from $1,073,523 in 2020. The increase of $822,210 was primarily due to an increase in volume of installations during 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as noted. The following table summarizes our cost of sales:
The gross profit in 2021 was $5,070,950 or 73% of sales compared with $3,327,918 or 76% of sales in 2020. This decrease is a result of maintenance wages not included in cost of sales during 2020, as a result of the COVID pandemic shut down. Additionally, there were a number of larger sales in 2021 verses 2020.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $3,562,003 in 2021 from $3,670,912 in 2020. This 3% decrease of $108,909 was primarily due to the receipt of the Employee Retention Credits of approximately $523,000 of which approximately $122,000 was recorded as a component of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2021. This was offset by an increase in bonus expense of approximately $188,500 in 2021.
Other Income
Other income was comprised of the PPP loan forgiveness income totaling $473,400 in both 2021 and 2020.
Interest Income
Interest income increased to $83,304 in 2021, compared to $79,487 in 2020, primarily due to the increase of interest income from our investments in money market instruments.
Income Tax Benefit (Expense)
The income tax expense was $298,000 in 2021, for an effective rate of 14.84%, compared to income tax benefit of $97,000 for an effective rate of -46.2% in 2020. The change in the effective rate is primarily due to changes in non-taxable income and non-deductible expenses and generation/utilization of tax credits.
Net Income
The net income for 2021 was $ 1,710,651 compared to net income of $ 306,893 for 2020, which is an increase of $1,403,758.
The basic and diluted earnings per share in 2021 were $ 0.38 and $0.37, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $ 0.07 in 2020.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The Company’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates these estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, bad debts, inventory valuation, intangible assets, and income taxes. The Company bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The estimates and judgments that the Company believes have the most effect on its reported financial position and results of operations are as follows:
Revenue Recognition
The Company derives revenues from the sales of systems, licenses and maintenance fees, hardware leasing and services.
System Sales
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected, when applicable from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is a unit of account in ASC 606. A majority of the Company’s systems sales have multiple performance obligations including an obligation to deliver a casino management system and another to provide maintenance services. For system sales with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its SSP. See discussion with in the significant judgement paragraph regarding our determination of SSP. At contract inception, management assesses whether it is probable that the company will collect substantially all of the consideration to determine whether the contract meets the criterion for collectability. The revenue allocated to the casino management system is recognized upon installation. The Company occasionally enters into contracts that include multiple sites; management has determined that each site installation is a separate performance obligation. In these instances, the Company recognizes revenue upon completion of each performance obligation. In addition, the Company has a contract with a reseller who purchases and resells the Company’s products; monthly the reseller notifies the Company of their successful installations, and submits an invoice to the Company for those installations. The Company also analyzes its standard business practice of using long-term contracts and the history of collecting on extended payment term contracts which include a significant financing component which is usually a market interest rate. The associated interest income is reflected accordingly on the statement of operations.
Management’s assessment of collectability at both contract inception and on an ongoing basis resulted in the determination that some of our contracts did not meet the criterion for collectability. The balance of these contracts are not included as part of accounts receivable on the balance sheet. Accordingly, for these contracts whereby the collectability criterion has not been met, revenue will be recognized as payments are received.
Maintenance Revenue
Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period. The SSP for maintenance is based upon the renewal rate for contracted services.
Lease Revenue
The Company derives a portion of its revenue from a sales type leasing arrangement in accordance with ASC 842. The Company leases hardware to a customer, and receives monthly payments.
Service Revenue and Other Revenue
Service revenue is recognized upon completion of the services and are billed in arrears. The SSP for service revenue is established based upon actual selling prices for the services or prior similar arrangements.
The Company offers qualified customers a licensing agreement. Licensing revenue is recognized after the intellectual property (CMS system), the performance obligation, is delivered and in its operational and functional state. The stand-alone selling price for licensing revenue is established based upon actual selling prices for the license.
See also Note 1.
Accounts Receivable / Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts receivable are initially recorded at the invoiced amount and carried on the balance sheet at net realizable value as of each balance sheet date. For receivables related to contracts that contain an interest rate, interest is recorded upon receipt to interest income on the statements of operations. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded when the Company believes the amounts may not be collected. Management believes that receivables, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, are fully collectible. Accounts receivable are written off when management determines collection is no longer likely. While the ultimate result may differ, management believes that any write-off not allowed for will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position.
Inventory
Inventory, consisting of finished goods, is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The average cost method (which approximates first in, first out method) is used to value inventory. Inventory is reviewed annually for the lower of cost or net realizable value and obsolescence. Any material cost found to be above market value or considered obsolete is written down accordingly. The Company had $36,353 and $45,045 of obsolescence reserves at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are provided for using the liability method of accounting. A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effect of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
