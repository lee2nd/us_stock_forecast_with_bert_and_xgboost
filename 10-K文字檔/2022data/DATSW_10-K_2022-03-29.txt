ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All amounts in this report are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.
Overview
We are a communication software company. We believe that one’s right to privacy should not end the moment they click “send.” Our flagship product, DatChat Messenger & Private Social Network (the “Application”), is a mobile application that gives users the ability to communicate with privacy and protection.
The Application allows users to exercise control over their messages, even after they are sent. Through the Application, users can delete messages that they have sent, on their own device and the recipient’s device as well. There is no set time limit within which they must exercise this choice. A user can elect at any time to delete a message that they previously sent to a recipient’s device.
The Application also enables users to hide secret and encrypted messages behind a cover, which messages can only be unlocked by the recipient and which are automatically destroyed after a fixed number of views or fixed amount of time. Users can decide how long their messages last on the recipient’s device. The Application also includes a screen shot protection system, which makes it virtually impossible for the recipient to screenshot a message or picture before it gets destroyed. In addition, users can delete entire conversations at any time, making it like the conversation never even happened.
The Application integrates with iMessage, making private messages potentially available to hundreds of millions of users.
Recent Events
On July 28, 2021, the Company filed a certificate of change to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to effectuate a one-for-two (1:2) reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock. Proportional adjustments for the Reverse Stock Split were made to the Company’s outstanding stock options, warrants and equity incentive plans. All share and per-share data and amounts have been retroactively adjusted as of the earliest period presented in the consolidated financial statements to reflect the Reverse Stock Split.

Basis of Presentation
The financial statements contained herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (the “U.S. GAAP”) and the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
This management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates if conditions differ from our assumptions. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 in the “Notes to Financial Statements”, we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in preparation of our financial statements.
Use of estimates
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates. Significant estimates include the valuation of deferred tax assets, and the value of stock-based compensation expenses.
Revenue recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires revenue to be recognized in a manner that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company recognize revenues from subscription fees on the Company’s messaging application in the month they are earned. Annual and lifetime subscription payments received that are related to future periods are recorded as deferred revenue to be recognized as revenues over the contract term or period. Lifetime subscriptions are being recognized to revenues over a 12-month period.
Stock-based compensation
Stock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”), which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee, non-employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee, non-employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). ASC 718 also requires measurement of the cost of employee, non-employee, and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award.
Leases
The Company applied ASC Topic 842, Leases (Topic 842) to arrangements with lease terms of 12 months or more. Operating lease right of use assets (“ROU”) represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company use an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the adoption date in determining the present value of future payments. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations.
Capital Expenditures
We do not have any contractual obligations for ongoing capital expenditures at this time. We do, however, purchase equipment and software necessary to conduct our operations on an as needed basis.
