The following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The following discussion provides an analysis of our results of operations and reasons for material changes therein for 2021 as compared to 2020. Discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for 2020 as compared to 2019 is included in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021.
Our Business
The Company is an industry-leading racing, online wagering and gaming entertainment company anchored by our iconic flagship event, the Kentucky Derby. We own and operate three pari-mutuel gaming entertainment venues with approximately 3,050 historical racing machines ("HRMs") in Kentucky. We also own and operate TwinSpires, one of the largest and most profitable online wagering platforms for horse racing, sports and iGaming in the U.S. and we have nine retail sportsbooks. We are also a leader in brick-and-mortar casino gaming in eight states with approximately 11,000 slot machines and video lottery terminals ("VLTs") and 200 table games. We were organized as a Kentucky corporation in 1928, and our principal executive offices are in Louisville, Kentucky.
During the first quarter of 2021, we updated our operating segments to reflect the internal management reporting used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate results of operations and to assess performance and allocate resources. Our internal management reporting changed primarily due to the continued growth from Oak Grove Racing, Gaming & Hotel ("Oak Grove") and Turfway Park Racing & Gaming (“Turfway Park”), which opened its annex HRM facility, Newport Racing & Gaming ("Newport"), in October 2020, which resulted in our chief operating decision maker's decision to include Oak Grove, Turfway Park and Newport in the new Live and Historical Racing segment. The Live and Historical Racing segment now includes Churchill Downs Racetrack, Derby City Gaming, Oak Grove, Turfway Park, and Newport. We also realigned our retail sports betting results at our wholly owned casinos from our Gaming segment to our TwinSpires segment. As a result of this realignment, our operating segments that meet the requirements to be disclosed separately as reportable segments are: Live and Historical Racing, TwinSpires, and Gaming. For additional information, refer to Note 22 to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Impact of the COVID-19 Global Pandemic
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. The COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in travel limitations and business and government shutdowns which had a significant negative economic impact in the United States and to our business. Although vaccines are available, we cannot predict the duration of the COVID-19 global pandemic. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence of variant strains, will continue to impact the Company remains uncertain and will depend on many factors that are not within our control.
In March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, we temporarily suspended operations at our wholly owned and managed gaming properties, announced the temporary furlough of our employees at these properties and certain racing operations and implemented a temporary salary reduction for all remaining non-furloughed salaried employees based on a percentage that varied dependent upon the amount of each employee’s salary. The most senior level of executive management received the largest salary decrease, based on both percentage and dollar amount.
In May 2020, we began to reopen our properties with patron restrictions and gaming limitations. One property suspended operations again in July 2020 and reopened in August 2020, and three properties suspended operations in December 2020 and reopened in January 2021. All of our gaming properties have remained open since January 2021.
The 146th Kentucky Oaks and Derby were held in the third quarter of 2020 without spectators. During the second quarter of 2021, we held the 147th Kentucky Oaks and Derby with capacity restrictions in compliance with Kentucky venue limitations at that time. The capacity restrictions limited reserved seating in each area to approximately 40% to 60% capacity and limited general admission tickets. Due to such restrictions, our revenues from the Kentucky Oaks and Derby in each year were significantly less than we would otherwise expect.
Assets Held for Sale
On September 29, 2021, the Company announced an agreement to sell the 326-acre property in Arlington Heights, Illinois (the "Arlington Property"), which is the current home of Arlington International Racecourse ("Arlington"), to the Chicago Bears for $197.2 million. The closing of the sale of the Arlington Property is subject to the satisfaction of various closing conditions. The Company anticipates closing the sale of the Arlington Property in early 2023.
The Company has classified certain assets of Arlington totaling $81.5 million as held for sale as of December 31, 2021, on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Arlington’s operations and assets are included in All Other in our consolidated
results. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded $1.4 million of severance costs and $3.9 million related to our multi-employer pension liability in conjunction with the announced sale of the Arlington Property.
On November 22, 2021, the Company announced an agreement to sell 115.7 acres of land near Calder Casino for $291.0 million or approximately $2.5 million per acre to Link Logistics Real Estate, a Blackstone portfolio company. The closing of the sale of the property is subject to the satisfaction of various closing conditions. The Company anticipates closing the sale of the property in the first half of 2022.
The Company has classified certain assets of Calder totaling $6.3 million as held for sale as of December 31, 2021, on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Calder's operations and assets are included in Gaming in our consolidated results.
Natural Disaster
In August 2021, Hurricane Ida caused damage to portions of Louisiana, including Fair Grounds Race Course & Slots, and 15 off-track betting facilities ("OTBs") owned by Video Services, LLC ("VSI") (collectively, "Fair Grounds and VSI"). All of the Fair Grounds and VSI operations were reopened as of December 31, 2021, with the exception of two OTBs.
The Company carries property and casualty insurance, as well as business interruption insurance subject to certain deductibles. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has recorded a reduction of property and equipment, net of $2.8 million and incurred $2.5 million in operating expenses. Through December 31, 2021, the Company has received $2.7 million in insurance recoveries from our carriers, and has an insurance recovery receivable of $2.6 million at December 31, 2021. The Company is currently working with its insurance carriers to finalize its claim. We continue to assess damages and insurance coverage, and we currently do not expect our losses to exceed the applicable insurance recoveries.
Key Indicators to Evaluate Business Results and Financial Condition
Our management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition. These indicators include changes in net revenue, operating expense, operating income, earnings per share, outstanding debt balance, operating cash flow and capital spend.
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). We also use non-GAAP measures, including EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance measure of results of operations enables management and investors to evaluate and compare from period to period our operating performance in a meaningful and consistent manner. Our chief operating decision maker utilizes Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate segment performance, develop strategy and allocate resources. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (as determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our operating results.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the following:
Adjusted EBITDA includes our portion of EBITDA from our equity investments.
Adjusted EBITDA excludes:
•Transaction expense, net which includes:
-Acquisition, disposition, and land sale related charges; and
-Other transaction expense, including legal, accounting and other deal-related expense.
•Stock-based compensation expense;
•Rivers Des Plaines' impact on our investments in unconsolidated affiliates from:
-The impact of changes in fair value of interest rate swaps, and
-Legal reserves and transaction costs.
•Asset impairments,
•Legal reserves,
•Pre-opening expense, and
•Other charges, recoveries and expenses
For segment reporting, Adjusted EBITDA includes intercompany revenue and expense totals that are eliminated in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). See the Reconciliation of Comprehensive Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA included in this section for additional information.

•Our net income attributable to Churchill Downs Incorporated increased $331.0 million due to a $235.8 million increase in net income from continuing operations discussed above and a $95.4 million net loss from discontinued operations in 2020 that did not recur in the current year, partially offset by $0.2 million decrease from other sources.

•Total assets increased $295.2 million driven by a $223.9 million increase in cash and cash equivalents primarily due to the net proceeds from the new Term Loan B-1 and Additional 2028 Notes and the increase in operating income for the year; a $33.0 million increase in investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates due to the Company's interest in Rivers Des Plaines and MVG; a $16.6 million increase in income taxes receivable due to the payment of the Kater and Thimmegowda litigation settlements in 2021 partially offset by our current year taxable income; and a $21.7 million increase in all other assets.
•Total liabilities increased $355.5 million driven by a $204.6 million increase in notes payable due to the proceeds from our Additional 2028 Notes; a $138.1 million increase in long-term debt due to the proceeds from the new Term Loan B-1 under our Credit Agreement; a $64.8 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities driven by an increase in accrued bonuses, purses payable due to timing, and increased account wagering deposits with TwinSpires;
a $39.0 million increase in deferred income taxes primarily driven by the payment of the Kater and Thimmegowda litigation settlements in 2021; a $14.9 million increase in current deferred revenue due to an increase in cash receipts related to the 2022 Kentucky Oaks and Derby; and an $18.1 million increase in all other liabilities. Partially offsetting these increases was a $124.0 million decrease in current liabilities of discontinued operations due to the payment of the Kater and Thimmegowda litigation settlements.
•Total shareholders’ equity decreased $60.3 million driven by $297.5 million in repurchases of common stock, $26.1 million from our annual dividend declared in December 2021, and $16.1 million in taxes paid related to net share settlement of stock awards. Partially offsetting these decreases were $249.1 million current year net income attributable to Churchill Downs Incorporated, $27.8 million from stock-based compensation, and $2.5 million from other sources.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have been and will continue to be cash flow from operations, borrowings under our Credit Facility, and proceeds from the issuance of debt securities. Our ongoing liquidity will depend on a number of factors, including available cash resources, cash flow from operations, acquisitions or equity investments, funding of construction for development projects, and our compliance with our covenants under our Credit Facility.
The following table is a summary of our liquidity and cash flows:
Year Ended December 31, Change
(in millions) 2021 2020
Cash Flows from:
Operating activities $ 459.5 $ 143.2 $ 316.3
Investing activities (100.4) (239.4) 139.0
Financing activities (0.5) 76.0 (76.5)
Operating Cash Flow
Cash provided by operating activities increased $316.3 million driven by a $224.2 million increase in operating income related to continuing operations, a $78.7 million increase in distributions from unconsolidated affiliates, and a $13.4 million increase from all other operating activities. We anticipate that cash flows from operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations and capital expenditures.
Investing Cash Flow
Cash used in investing activities decreased $139.0 million driven by $158.9 million decrease in capital project expenditures due to reduced capital project spending in 2021 compared to prior year. Partially offsetting this decrease was a $16.5 million increase in capital maintenance expenditures and a $3.4 million increase from all other investing activities.
Financing Cash Flow
Cash provided by financing activities decreased $76.5 million driven by a $269.1 million increase in common stock repurchases and a $11.6 million decrease from all other financing activities. Partially offsetting this decrease was a $204.2 million increase in net borrowings from long-term debt.
Capital Expenditures
Included in cash flows from investing activities are capital maintenance expenditures and capital project expenditures. Capital maintenance expenditures relate to the replacement of existing fixed assets with a useful life greater than one year that are obsolete, exhausted, or no longer cost effective to repair. Capital project expenditures represent fixed asset additions related to land or building improvements to new or existing assets or purchases of new (non-replacement) equipment or software related to specific projects deemed necessary expenditures.
We have announced several project capital investments during the past year, including the following: Churchill Downs Racetrack Homestretch Club, Churchill Downs Racetrack Turn I Experience, Derby City Gaming Expansion and Hotel, Derby City Gaming Downtown, Turfway Park HRM Facility and Grandstand, the Queen of Terre Haute Casino Resort, and Louisiana HRMs in our OTBs. We are currently estimating that we will spend between $300 million and $350 million for project capital in 2022, although this amount may vary significantly based on the timing of work completed, unanticipated delays, and timing of payments to third parties.
Common Stock Repurchase Program
On September 29, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a common stock repurchase program of up to $500.0 million (“2021 Stock Repurchase Program”). The 2021 Stock Repurchase Program includes and is not in addition to the unspent amount remaining under the prior 2018 Stock Purchase Program authorization. Repurchases may be made at management’s discretion from time to time on the open market (either with or without a 10b5-1 plan) or through privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We had $445.6 million of repurchase authority remaining under this program at December 31, 2021.
Dividends
On October 26, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors approved an annual cash dividend on our common stock of $0.667 per outstanding share, which represented a 7% increase over the prior year. The dividend was payable on January 7, 2022 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 3, 2021. The 7% increase marked the 11th consecutive year that the Company has increased the dividend. The payment and amount of future dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, our operating results, financial condition, cash requirements and general business conditions at the time such payment is considered.

Credit Agreement
On December 27, 2017, we entered into a senior secured credit agreement (as amended, the "Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of lenders. The Credit Agreement provides for a $700.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility due 2024 (the "Revolver") and a $400.0 million Senior Secured Term Loan B due 2024 (the "Term Loan B"). Included in the maximum borrowing of $700.0 million under the Revolver is a letter of credit sub facility not to exceed $50.0 million and a swing line commitment up to a maximum principal amount of $50.0 million. The Credit Agreement is collateralized by substantially all of the wholly-owned assets of the Company. The Company capitalized debt issuance costs of $1.6 million associated with the Revolver and $5.1 million associated with the Term Loan B, both of which are being amortized over the respective debt period.
The Term Loan B requires quarterly payments of 0.25% of the original $400.0 million balance, or $1.0 million per quarter. The Term Loan B may be subject to additional mandatory prepayment from excess cash flow on an annual basis per the provisions of the 2017 Credit Agreement. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolver determined by a pricing grid based on the consolidated total net leverage ratio of the Company. For the period ended December 31, 2021, the Company's commitment fee rate was 0.20%.
On April 28, 2020, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement, which (i) provided for a financial covenant relief period through the date on which the Company delivered the Company's quarterly financial statements and compliance certificate for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2021, subject to certain exceptions (the "Financial Covenant Relief Period"), (ii) amended the definition of "Consolidated EBITDA" in the Credit Agreement with respect to the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA for the first two fiscal quarters after the termination of the Financial Covenant Relief Period, (iii) extended certain deadlines and makes certain other amendments to the Company’s financial reporting obligations, (iv) placed certain restrictions on restricted payments during the Financial Covenant Relief Period, and (v) amended the definitions of "Material Adverse Effect" and "License Revocation" in the Credit Agreement to take into consideration COVID-19.
On February 1, 2021, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement to increase the restricted payments capacity during the Financial Covenant Relief Period from $26.0 million to $226.0 million to accommodate a share repurchase from an affiliate of The Duchossois Group, Inc. Refer to Note 11, Shareholders' Equity, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding this transaction.
On March 17, 2021, the Company entered into the Incremental Joinder Agreement No. 1 (the "Joinder") to its Credit Agreement which provided $300.0 million in New Term Loan Commitments ("Term Loan B-1") as a new tranche of term loans under the existing Credit Agreement (as conformed to recognize the new loan), and carries a maturity date of March 17, 2028. The Term Loan B-1 bears interest at LIBOR plus 200 basis points and requires quarterly payments of 0.25% of the original $300.0 million balance. The Term Loan B-1 may be subject to additional mandatory prepayment from excess cash flow on an annual basis per the provisions of the Credit Agreement. The Company capitalized $3.5 million of debt issuance costs associated with the Joinder which are being amortized as interest expense over the 7-year term of the Term Loan B-1.
The interest rate on the Revolver on December 31, 2021 was LIBOR plus 137.5 basis points based on the Revolver pricing grid in the Second Amendment and the Company's net leverage ratio as of September 30, 2021. The Term Loan B and Term Loan B-1 bear interest at LIBOR plus 200 basis points.
The Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, which include limitations on liens, investments, indebtedness, dispositions, mergers and acquisitions, the making of restricted payments, changes in the nature of business, changes in fiscal year, and transactions with affiliates. The Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants providing for the maintenance of a maximum consolidated secured net leverage ratio and maintenance of a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio.
Actual Requirement
Interest coverage ratio 6.6 to 1.0 > 2.5 to 1.0
Consolidated total secured net leverage ratio 0.9 to 1.0 < 4.0 to 1.0
The Company was compliant with all applicable covenants on December 31, 2021.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our significant accounting policies and recently adopted accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on our historical experience, contract terms,
observance of known trends in our Company and the industry as a whole and information available from other outside sources. Our estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those initial estimates.
Our critical accounting estimates relate to goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets.
Goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets
Acquisition of certain identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets
In conjunction with the acquisition of a business, the Company records identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of gaming rights and trademarks. Gaming rights and trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets that do not require amortization based on our future expectations to operate our gaming facilities and use the trademarks indefinitely, and our historical experience in renewing these intangible assets at minimal cost with various state gaming commissions.
We use various valuation methods to determine initial fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, including the Greenfield Method and relief-from-royalty method of the income approach, all of which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. The use of these valuation methods requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions about future revenue and operating expenses, expected start-up costs, capital expenditures, royalty rate, and the discount rate. The fair values of gaming rights are generally determined using the Greenfield Method, which is an income approach methodology that calculates the present value based on a projected cash flow stream. This method assumes that the gaming rights provides the opportunity to develop a casino in a specified region, and that the present value of the projected cash flows are a result of the realization of advantages contained in these rights. Under this methodology, the acquirer is expected to absorb all start-up costs, as well as incur all expenses pertaining to the acquisition and/or the creation of all tangible and intangible assets. The estimated future revenue and operating expenses, start-up costs of the acquired business, and the discount rate are the primary assumptions and estimates used in these valuations. The fair values of trademarks are generally determined using the relief-from-royalty method of the income approach, which estimates the fair value of the intangible asset by discounting the fair value of the hypothetical royalty payments a market participant would be willing to pay to enjoy the benefits of the trademarks. The estimated future revenue, royalty rate, and the discount rate are the primary assumptions and estimates used in these valuations. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are generally derived from the weighted average cost of capital analysis and adjusted for the size and/or risk of the asset.
Assessments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
We perform our annual review for impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on April 1 of each fiscal year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not the asset is impaired. Adverse industry or economic trends, lower projections of profitability, or a sustained decline in our market capitalization, among other items, may be indications of potential impairment issues which are triggering events requiring the testing of an asset’s carrying value for recoverability.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are required to be tested annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset is impaired. An entity may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to complete the impairment test using a more likely than not criteria. If an entity believes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, the quantitative impairment test can be bypassed. Alternatively, an entity has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. If a quantitative impairment test of goodwill is required, we generally determine the fair value under the market and income valuation approaches using inputs primarily related to discounted projected cash flows and price multiples of publicly traded comparable companies. If a quantitative impairment test of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is required, we generally determine the fair value using the Greenfield Method for gaming rights and relief-from-royalty method of the income approach for trademarks. Qualitative factors include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors and overall financial performance, among others. These factors require significant judgments and estimates, and application of alternative assumptions could produce materially different results. Evaluations of possible impairment require us to estimate, among other factors, forecasts of future operating results, revenue growth, operating expense, tax rates, start-up costs, capital expenditures, depreciation, working capital, discount rates, long-term growth rates, risk premiums, royalty rates, terminal values, and fair values of our reporting units and assets. The impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to uncertainties arising from such events as changes in competitive conditions, the current economic environment, material changes in growth rate assumptions that could positively or negatively impact anticipated future operating conditions and cash flows, changes in the discount rate, and the impact of strategic decisions. If any of these factors were to materially change, such change may require a reevaluation of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results.
