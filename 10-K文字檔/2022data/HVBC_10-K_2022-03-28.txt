Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This section is intended to help investors understand the financial performance of HV Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiary through a discussion of the factors affecting our financial condition as of December 31, 2021and 2020, and our results of operations for the year ended December 31,2021 and 2020, respectively. This section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to the audited consolidated financial statements that appear beginning on page 48 of this annual report.
Overview
HV Bancorp, Inc.,through the Bank, provides financial services to individuals and businesses from our main office in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, and from our seven full-service banking offices located in Plumsteadville, Philadelphia, Warrington and Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania and Mount Laurel, New Jersey. We also operate a limited service branch in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Our administrative offices and executive offices are located in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. Our Business Banking office is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We have loan production and sales offices located in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, Doylestown, Pennsylvania, Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, and Wilmington, Delaware; and a loan origination office in Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania. Our primary market area includes Montgomery, Bucks and Philadelphia Counties in Pennsylvania, Burlington County in New Jersey and New Castle County in Delaware. Our principal business consists of attracting retail deposits from the general public in our market area and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, primarily in one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans (including multi-family loans), construction loans, home equity loans and lines of credit and, to a lesser extent, consumer loans. We retain our loans in portfolio depending on market conditions, but we primarily sell our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. We also invest in various investment securities. Our revenue is derived principally from interest on loans and investments and loan sales. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances and principal and interest payments on loans and securities.
Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our results of operations also are affected by our provision for loan losses, non-interest income and non-interest expense. Non-interest income currently consists primarily of gains recognized from the sale of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market, fees for customer services, gain (loss) from derivative instruments and sales of securities. Non-interest expense currently consists primarily of expenses related to salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, data processing related operations, professional fees and other expenses.
Our results of operations also may be affected significantly by general, regional, and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities.
Business Strategy
We intend to operate as a well-capitalized and profitable community bank dedicated to providing exceptional personal service to our consumer and business customers. We believe that we have a competitive advantage in the markets we serve because of our knowledge of the local marketplace and our long-standing history of providing superior, relationship-based customer service. Our core business strategies are to:
•
Continue to Originate and Sell Certain Residential Real Estate Loans. Residential mortgage lending has historically been a significant part of our business, and we recognize that originating one- to four-family residential real estate loans is essential to our status as a community-oriented bank. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we originated $614.1 million in one- to four-family residential real estate loans held for sale, selling $670.6 million in one- to four-family residential real estate loans held for sale for gains on sale of $14.9 million. We intend to continue to sell in the secondary market most of the long-term conforming fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate to increase non-interest income and manage the overall duration of our loan portfolio. We also intend to hold an appropriately sized portfolio of jumbo adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans in order to increase interest income and help manage our interest rate risk. At December 31, 2021, we had $32.8 million in jumbo one- to four-family residential real estate loans, which represented 30.8% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loan portfolio compared to $73.8 million or 52.0% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loan portfolio at December 31, 2020.
•
Increase Commercial Real Estate and Commercial business. In 2019, we established a new business banking division which greatly expanded the Bank’s commercial real estate and commercial business portfolios. The inclusion of commercial real estate and commercial business loans may increase the yield on the loan portfolio and should help reduce interest rate risk while maintaining what we believe are conservative underwriting standards.
•
Maintain High Asset Quality. Strong asset quality is critical to the long-term financial success of a community bank. We attribute our high asset quality to maintaining conservative underwriting standards, the diligence of our loan servicing personnel and the stability of the local economy. At December 31, 2021, our non-performing assets to total assets ratio was 1.14%. Because a substantial amount of our loans are secured by real estate, the level of our non-performing loans has been low in recent years. We adhere to a credit culture that is supported by strong underwriting standards and believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb the probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio.
•
Maintain Level of Core Deposits. We plan to continue to market our transaction and savings accounts, emphasizing our high-quality, personalized customer service coupled with customer-facing technologies. We also offer the convenience of technology-based products, such as remote deposit capture, internet banking, mobile banking and mobile capture. Our ratio of core (non-time) deposits to total deposits was 93.1% at December 31, 2021.
Critical Accounting Policies
The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations.
The following represents our critical accounting policies:
Allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to income. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment.
The allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans. The allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses, and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. All, or part, of the principal balance of loans receivable are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all, or part, of the principal balance is highly unlikely.
The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated. Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance. The allowance is based on the Bank’s past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.
The allowance consists of specific, and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers pools of loans by loan class including commercial loans not considered impaired, as well as smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgage, home equity, home equity lines of credit and consumer loans. These pools of loans are evaluated for loss exposure based upon historical loss rates for each of these categories of loans, adjusted for qualitative factors.
These qualitative risk factors include:
•
Lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices;
•
National, regional, and local economic and business conditions as well as the condition of various market segments, including the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans;
•
Nature and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans;
•
Volume and severity of past due, classified and nonaccrual loans as well as and other loan modifications;
•
Existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations; and
•
Effect of external factors, such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements.
Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition, the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. These agencies may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would adversely affect earnings.
See Note 1 of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this annual report.
Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of the evidence available, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. See also Note 14- Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Investment Securities. Securities are evaluated on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when market conditions warrant such an evaluation, to determine whether declines in their value are other-than-temporary. To determine whether a loss in value is other-than-temporary, management utilizes criteria such as reasons underlying the decline, the magnitude and duration of the decline and whether or not management intends to sell or expects that it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security prior to an anticipated recovery of fair value. The term “other-than-temporary” is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent but indicates that the prospects for a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment. Once a decline in value for a debt security is determined to be other-than-temporary, the other-than-temporary impairment is separated into (a) the amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to a decrease in cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security (the credit losses) and (b) the amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to other factors. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).
Fair Value Measurements. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A more detailed description of the fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy and our methodology can be found in Note 15 of the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this transition report on Form 10-K.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. We use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks primarily associated with fluctuations in interest rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes. All of our derivative instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are included in the consolidated statements of financial condition as mortgage banking derivatives and other liabilities. The fair value of our derivative instruments, other than Interest Rate Lock Commitments (“IRLC”) is determined by utilizing quoted prices from dealers in such securities or third-party models utilizing observable market inputs. The fair value of the Company’s IRLC instruments are based upon the underlying mortgage loan adjusted for the probability of such commitments being exercised and estimated costs to complete and originate the loan. The changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are included in non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income.
To be announced securities (“TBAs”) are “forward delivery” securities considered derivative instruments under derivatives and hedging accounting guidance, (FASB ASC 815). We utilize TBAs to protect against the price risk inherent in derivative loan commitments. TBAs are valued based on forward dealer marks from our approved counterparties. We utilize a third-party market pricing service, which compiles current prices for instruments from market sources and those prices represent the current executable price. TBAs are recorded at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition in mortgage derivatives and other liabilities with changes in fair value recorded in non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income.
Loan commitments that are derivatives are recognized at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition as mortgage banking derivatives and as other liabilities with changes in their fair values recorded as a gain in hedging instruments in non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income. Outstanding IRLCs are subject to interest rate risk and related price risk during the period from the date of issuance through the date of loan funding, cancellation or expiration. Loan commitments generally range between 30 and 90 days; however, the borrower is not obligated to obtain the loan. We are subject to fallout risk related to IRLCs, which is realized if approved borrowers choose not to close on the loans within the terms of the IRLCs. We have used mandatory commitments to substantially reduce these risks. See Note 11 Derivatives and Risk Management Activities in the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company in this annual report.
COVID-19 UPDATE
Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”)
The Company participated in two rounds of the United States Small Business Administration’s (“SBA”) PPP, successfully processing over 800 applications totaling approximately $126.0 million. As of December 31, 2021, the Company with an outstanding PPP balance of $22.9 million. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized approximately $3.2 million and $528,000, respectively in fees and interest income related to the PPP loan. Through mid-March 2022, the Company received approximately $115.6 million in PPP forgiveness from the SBA. The processing fee income is deferred and recognized over the contractual life of the loan or accelerated if the loan is forgiven. The PPP loans have a two-year to four-year term and earn interest at 1%. The SBA fully guarantees the principal and interest, unless the lender violated an obligation under the agreement. The Company did not include the PPP loans in the allowance for loan loss calculation as loan losses, if any, are anticipated to be immaterial.
Main Street Lending Program
In December 2020, the Company participated in the Main Street Lending Program established by the Federal Reserve to support lending to small and medium-sized for-profit businesses and nonprofit organizations that were in sound financial condition before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The program ended on January 8, 2021. At December 31, 2020, the Company funded approximately $31.1 million in loans. The Company retained approximately 5% or $1.6 million outstanding balance at December 31, 2021 and 2020 as 95% of the originated loans were sold to the Federal Reserve of Boston as part of the program.
Deferral Requests
The Company has worked with the customers impacted by COVID-19 to provide short-term assistance up to nine months in accordance with regulatory guidelines. Commercial borrowers requesting assistance have been offered either a 90-day principal and interest deferral or a 90-day interest only with a potential deferral of up to two additional months. These deferrals do not constitute Troubled Debt Restructurings (“TDRS”) because they met the requirements under section 4013 of the CARES Act. Under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, loans less than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019, will be considered current for COVID-19 modifications. A financial institution can then use FASB agreed upon temporary changes to GAAP for loan modifications related to COVID-19 that would otherwise be categorized as a TDR and suspend any determination of a loan modified as a result of COVID-19 being a TDR, including the requirement to determine impairment for accounting purposes. Similarly, FASB has confirmed that short-term modifications made on a good-faith basis in response to COVID-19 to loan customers who were current prior to any relief are not TDRs.
Residential borrowers needing assistance have been offered a 90-day principal and interest deferral with a potential additional 90-day deferral. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had no deferral requests compared to two residential one-to four-family loan deferral requests and one commercial real estate loan deferral request totaling $1.8 million in outstanding loans as of December 31, 2020.

.
In November 2017, the Bank entered into a loan purchase agreement with a broker to purchase a portfolio of private education loans made to American citizens attending AMA-approved medical schools in Caribbean nations. The broker serves as a lender, holder, program designer and developer, administrator, and secondary market for the loan portfolios they generate.

Loans Held For Sale
Loans held for sale decreased $43.0 million to $40.5 million at December 31, 2021 from $83.5 million at December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily a result of originations of $614.1 million of one- to four-family residential real estate loans during the year ended December 31, 2020 and net of principle sales of $670.6 million of loans in the secondary market during this same period.
Deposits

The advances of $27.0 million were refinanced to a five-year term at 85 basis points with an effective rate of 1.45% including the impact of the prepayment fee. The refinancing was accounted for as a loan modification. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had $26.4 million and $26.3 million in advances outstanding.
Advances from the Federal Reserve Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (“PPPLF”)
Advances from the Federal Reserve PPPLF decreased $45.6 million from $48.7 million at December 31, 2020 to $3.1 million at December 31, 2021, as a result of repayments from PPP loan forgiveness from the SBA.
Subordinated Debt
On May 28, 2021, the Company issued a $10.0 million subordinated note. This note has a maturity date of May 28, 2031, and bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.50% per annum through May 28, 2026. Thereafter, the note rate is adjustable and resets quarterly based on the then current 90-day average Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus 325 basis points for U.S. dollar denominated loans as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Company may, at its option, at any time on an interest payment date, on or after May 28, 2026, redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at par plus accrued interest to the date of redemption. The balance of subordinated debt, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, was $10.0 million at December 31, 2021.
Total Shareholders’ Equity
Total shareholders’ equity increased $3.7 million, or 9.5%, to $42.6 million at December 31, 2021, from $38.9 million at December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of net income of $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, share based compensation expense of $240,000 and ESOP shares committed to be released of $166,000 and stock option exercises of $28,000. Offsetting these increases was other comprehensive loss of $386,000 due to fair value adjustments, net of deferred tax, on the investment securities available-for-sale portfolio and $391,000 in treasury stock repurchases primarily as part of the stock repurchase plan approved in April 2019.

General
Net income decreased $1.7 million, or 29.3%, to $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to a decrease of $3.5 million in in non-interest income and $3.4 million increase in non-interest expense partially offset by an increase of $3.8 million in net interest income, decrease of $740,000 in income tax expense and $555,000 in provision for loan losses as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
Interest Income

The average yield on investment securities to 2.12% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 2.31% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The average balance of investment securities increased by $12.3 million to $33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Interest on interest-earning deposits increased $23,000 to $181,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $158,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning deposits of $97.4 million to $139.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $41.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Offsetting this increase, was a decrease of 25 basis points in the average yield on interest-earning deposits with banks to 0.13% for the year ended December 31, 2021, from 0.38% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Interest Expense
Total interest expense decreased $930,000 to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to a $1.0 million decrease in interest on deposits, $128,000 decrease in interest expense on advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank and $47,000 decrease in interest expense on advances from the PPPLF offset by an increase of $268,000 in interest expense from subordinated debt.
Interest on deposits decreased $1.0 million to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of a decrease in average cost of deposits of 50 basis points to 0.37% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 0.87% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Offsetting this decrease, was an increase in the average interest-bearing deposits of $112.2 million to $401.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $289.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily the result of a $125.8 million increase in the average balance of our core deposit accounts offset by a decrease of $13.6 million in the average balance of our certificates of deposit. The average rate paid on money market deposits was 0.57% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 0.70% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in the balance of our certificates of deposit of $13.6 million from $61.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily the result of a $9.9 million decrease in the average balance of certificates of deposit issued through brokers from $14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and a decrease of $3.7 million in the average balance in retail certificates of deposit. The average cost of certificates of deposit was 0.90% for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 1.60% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Interest on advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank decreased $128,000 to $395,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $523,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of a decrease in the average balance of Federal Home Loan Bank advances. The average balance of Federal Home Loan Bank advances decreased by $2.7 million to $26.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $29.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, the average cost of Federal Home Loan Bank advances decreased by 30 basis points to 1.50% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 1.80% for the year ended December 31, 2020. During the July 2020, the Company refinanced advances of $27.0 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank to reduce the cost of borrowings.
Interest expense on advances from the PPPLF decreased $47,000 to $72,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $119,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily the result of a $7.3 million decrease in the average balance in advances from the PPPLF to $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and a decrease in average cost of advances from the PPPLF to 30 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2021, from 39 basis points for the same period in 2020.
Interest expense on subordinated debt was $268,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. On May 28, 2021, the Company sold and issued a $10.0 million in aggregate principal amount 4.50% fixed to floating rate subordinated note due 2031 (see footnote 9 subordinated debt for further discussion).
Net Interest Income
Net interest income increased $3.8 million, or 35.5%, to $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as our net interest-earning assets increased by $39.6 million to $105.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $66.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our interest rate spread increased by 5 basis points to 2.48% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 2.43% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our net interest margin was 2.57% for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Average Balances and Yields. The following table sets forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the years indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments have been made. All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense.
(1)
Includes loans held for sale.
(2)
Interest rate spread represents the difference between the average yield on average interest-earning assets and the average cost of average interest-bearing liabilities.
(3)
Net interest-earning assets represent total interest-earning assets less total interest-bearing liabilities.
(4)
Net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets.
Rate/Volume Analysis
The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the years indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately, based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.
Provision for Loan Losses
We establish a provision for loan losses, which is charged to operations, in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level we consider necessary to absorb credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimated at the balance sheet date. In determining the level of the allowance for loan losses, we consider past and current loss experience, evaluations of real estate collateral, current economic conditions, volume and type of lending, adverse situations that may affect a borrower’s ability to repay a loan and the levels of non-performing loans. The amount of the allowance is based on estimates, and actual losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or economic conditions change.
This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as circumstances change as more information becomes available. The allowance for loan losses is assessed on a quarterly basis and provisions are made for loan losses as required in order to maintain the allowance. Provision for loan losses decreased by $555,000 to $553,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting improvement in economic factors previously impacted by COVID-19 compared to the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2021, total charge-offs of $210,000 were recorded and $8,000 of recoveries were received. During the year ended December 31, 2020, total charge-offs of $529,000 were recorded and $1,000 of recoveries were received.
Non-Interest Income
Non-interest income decreased $3.5 million to $13.4 million for the year ended December 31 2021, from $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in non-interest income compared to the same period in 2020 was primarily due to was primarily due to decreases of $2.8 million in change in fair value of loans held-for-sale and $2.7 million in loss from derivative instruments offset by increases of $1.6 million in the gain on sale of loans and $349,000 in fees for customer services. The decrease in fair value of loans held for sale of $2.8 million for the year end December 31, 2021 compared to same period in 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the loans held for sale balance, from $83.5 million at December 31, 2020, to $40.5 million at December 31, 2021. Loss from derivative instruments, net increased $2.7 million from a gain of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to a loss of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Offsetting these decreases, was a $1.6 million increase in the gain on sale of loans, net to $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of higher loan sales which increased $69.8 million from $600.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to $670.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Fees for customer services increased $349,000 to $495,000 for the year ended December 31 2021, from $146,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of an increase in cash management fees compared to the prior year.
Non-Interest Expense
Non-interest expense increased $3.4 million, or 18.4%, to $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily reflected increases of $2.2 million in salaries and employee benefits, $418,000 in other expenses, $424,000 in occupancy expenses, $304,000 in data processing-related operations costs, $224,000 in federal deposit insurance premiums and $190,000 in professional fees offset by a $418,000 decrease in mortgage operation expenses.
Salaries and employee benefits expense increased by $2.2 million to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Salaries increased as full time equivalent (FTE) employees increased to one-hundred-forty-three as of December 31, 2021 from one-hundred-twenty-six as of December 31, 2020 primarily resulting from the expansion of Company’s lending operations and business banking operations. Other expenses increased $418,000 or 28.4%, to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to increased expenses related to organizational expenses as we continue to grow and expand into new markets. Occupancy expenses increased $424,000, or 18.3% to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily from increases in expenses related to leases of additional offices space compared to the same period in 2020. Data processing related operations costs increased $304,000, or 26.2% to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of expansion of locations, increased loan originations, increased information technology projects, and outsourcing of the PPP forgiveness process. Federal deposit insurance premiums increased $224,000 to $490,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $266,000 from the year ended December 31, 2020, as the average balance of interest- bearing deposits increased $112.2 million from $289.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $401.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Professional fees increased $190,000, or 24.3% to $971,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $781,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Offsetting these increases was a decrease of $418,000 in mortgage operation expenses which decreased to $522,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $940,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in mortgage operation expenses was a result of a decreased reserves for early payoffs (“EPO”) as compared to prior year. The EPO reserve is for loan pay-offs within six-months to the sale of an investor where the premium is to be paid back and pair-off fees for failure to deliver into a loan commitment when the mortgage loan has closed.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Federal income taxes included in total taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $1.1 million and $1.5 million, respectively, with effective federal tax rates of 19.1% and 19.3%, respectively.
Pennsylvania state tax was $308,000 and $637,000, respectively, with effective rates of 5.6% and 8.0%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period a year ago reflected a decrease in income before taxes. In addition, included in total taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, was $103,000 and $29,000 of New Jersey state tax.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity Management. Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and proceeds from sales, maturities and calls of securities. In addition, we can use brokered certificates of deposit as a funding source of our asset base. As of December 31, 2021, there were no brokered certificates of deposit outstanding. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had brokered certificates of deposit of $10.0 million, or 1.2% of total asset with an average cost of 1.43%.
We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. Huntingdon Valley Bank had Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh advances of $27.0 million outstanding with unused borrowing capacity of $50.6 million as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, at December 31, 2021, we had the ability to borrow $3.0 million from the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank. We have not borrowed against the credit lines with the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank for the year ended December 31, 2021.
The board of directors is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies. We believe that we have enough sources of liquidity to satisfy our short and long-term liquidity needs as of December 31, 2021.
We monitor and adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of: (1) expected loan demand; (2) expected deposit flows; (3) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities; and (4) the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest-earning deposits and short-and intermediate-term securities.
While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which include federal funds sold and interest-earnings deposits in other banks. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At December 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents totaled $120.8 million. Securities classified as available-for-sale, which provide additional sources of liquidity, totaled $44.5 million at December 31, 2021.
Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $42.9 million and ($37.4) million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loans originations and the purchase of securities, offset by principal collections on loans and proceeds from maturing securities, was $32.2 million and $62.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we sold $5.5 million and $4.9 million, respectively, in securities available-for-sale. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities was ($304.5) million and $493.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted primarily of a decrease in deposits of $266.8 million, repayments of $45.6 million from the PPPLF offset by proceeds of $10.0 million from the issuance of subordinated debt. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020
consisted primarily of increases in deposits of $447.1 million, net proceeds of $48.7 million from the PPPLF offset by purchase of treasury stock of $1.1 million and net repayments of $810,000 of borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank.
We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Certificates of deposit due within one year of December 31, 2021, totaled $24.7 million, or 5.3%, of total deposits. If these deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or borrowings than we currently pay. We believe, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered.
Capital Management. Huntingdon Valley Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning Statement of Financial Condition assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At December 31, 2021, Huntingdon Valley Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and was considered “well capitalized” under regulatory guidelines. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations
Commitments. As a financial services provider, we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. While these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make. At December 31, 2021, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $48.1 million and unused lines of credit totaling $70.2 million. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current lending commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2021 totaled $24.7 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize Federal Home Loan Bank advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense.
Contractual Obligations. In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
The financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than does inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.
