ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the ‘‘Risk Factors’’ section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
We are a biotechnology company focused on developing precision therapies for genetically defined diseases. Our approach is to design rational precision therapies that treat the underlying cause of disease and improve the lives of patients. Our most advanced program is bezuclastinib (also known as CGT9486), a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor designed to potently inhibit the KIT D816V mutation as well as other mutations in KIT exon 17. In the vast majority of cases, KIT D816V is responsible for driving Systemic Mastocytosis (“SM”), a serious disease caused by unchecked proliferation of mast cells. Exon 17 mutations are also found in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (“GIST”), a type of cancer with strong dependence on oncogenic KIT signaling. Bezuclastinib is a highly selective and potent KIT inhibitor with the potential to provide a new treatment option for these patient populations.
Bezuclastinib has been administered to more than 50 advanced solid tumor and GIST patients in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, with the vast majority of those patients living with advanced GIST. GIST is a disease frequently driven by KIT mutations, and resistance to currently available therapeutics is frequently associated with the emergence of other KIT mutations. Anti-tumor activity for bezuclastinib was observed in both single agent and combination settings, including in combination with sunitinib, an approved treatment option for GIST patients. Clinical data from this trial have been published in the Journal of American Medical Association (“JAMA”) and have been presented at several scientific conferences, including most recently by Cogent at the 2020 annual Connective Tissue Oncology Society (“CTOS”) meeting, and previously by Plexxikon Inc. (“Plexxikon”), a member of the Daiichi Sankyo Group, at the 2018 annual American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”) meeting and the 2017 annual CTOS meeting. Within the group of 15 heavily pre-treated GIST patients who received the combination of bezuclastinib and sunitinib, and who had not received prior treatment with bezuclastinib, the confirmed objective response rate (“ORR”) was twenty percent, including two partial responses and one complete response, while the estimated median progression free survival (“mPFS”) for this group was twelve months. Four subjects continued to receive bezuclastinib via individual patient INDs beyond the conclusion of the trial. In October 2021, we presented preclinical data in a virtual poster at the 2021 AACR-NCI-EORTC Virtual International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics that identified bezuclastinib as a differentiated, potent and selective KIT mutant inhibitor with unique selectivity for KIT D816V and minimal evidence of brain penetration that avoids targeting PDGFR isoforms.
Based on these results, we initiated PEAK, a randomized open-label, global Phase 3 clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2021. The PEAK study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of bezuclastinib in combination with sunitinib compared to sunitinib alone in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic GIST who have received prior treatment with imatinib. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to bezuclastinib for the treatment of GIST.
In addition to continuing the development of bezuclastinib in GIST patients, we are pursuing development of the compound in patients living with Advanced Systemic Mastocytosis (“AdvSM”) and Non-Advanced Systemic Mastocytosis (“Non-AdvSM”). The vast majority of AdvSM and Non-AdvSM patients have a KIT D816V mutation. Patients with AdvSM have a significantly diminished lifespan with a median survival of less than 3.5 years. For patients with Non-AdvSM, there are no available approved therapies, and while their lifespan is not impacted by the disease, these patients suffer from a poor quality of life and new treatment options are badly needed. Emerging clinical data for other kinase inhibitors with activity against KIT D816V have shown that the disease is highly sensitive to inhibition of the target. Bezuclastinib was specifically designed to selectively inhibit KIT mutations on exon 17, including KIT D816V, and we have expanded the clinical development program to include clinical trials in SM patients.
In the second quarter of 2021, we initiated APEX, a Phase 2 clinical study of bezuclastinib in patients with AdvSM. APEX is an open-label, global, multicenter study evaluating the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles of bezuclastinib. We expect to report preliminary clinical data at a scientific conference during the first half of 2022, including safety and tolerability data as well as bezuclastinib's impact on serum tryptase levels, a validated biomarker of mast cell activity.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we initiated SUMMIT, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global Phase 2 clinical trial. The study is designed to explore the safety and efficacy of bezuclastinib in patients with moderate to severe Indolent Systemic Mastocytosis (“ISM”) or Smoldering Systemic Mastocytosis (“SSM”).
In November 2021, through a partnership with Serán Biosciences, we announced the development of an updated formulation of bezuclastinib. This formulation is expected to reduce the number of daily tablets, improving the overall patient experience, and is initially being used in our PEAK trial.
Worldwide rights to develop and commercialize bezuclastinib are exclusively licensed from Plexxikon. Under the terms of the license agreement, Plexxikon received an upfront payment and is eligible for additional development milestones of up to $7.5 million upon the satisfaction of certain clinical milestones, of which $2.5 million may become payable in the next twelve months as a result of the progression of our on-going clinical studies, and up to $25.0 million upon the satisfaction of certain regulatory milestones and mid- to high- single-digit royalty payments.
Patents protecting bezuclastinib include composition of matter claims which have issued in the US and other key territories and provide exclusivity through 2033 and potentially beyond through patent term extensions.
During the second quarter of 2021, we announced the formation of the Cogent Research Team, a highly experienced discovery and research team. Based in Boulder, Colorado, the Cogent Research Team is focused on pioneering best-in-class, small molecule therapeutics to expand Cogent's pipeline and deliver novel precision therapies for patients living with unmet medical needs.
Since our inception in 2014, we have focused significant efforts and financial resources on establishing and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, conducting research and development of our product candidates, manufacturing drug product material for use in preclinical studies and clinical trials, staffing our company, and raising capital. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sales of preferred stock, our public offerings of our common stock and private placements.
On July 6, 2020, we issued a contingent value right (“CVR”), which was distributed to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 6, 2020, and prior to the issuance of any shares to acquire Kiq Bio LLC (“Kiq”) or sold to the Private Investment in Public Equity (“PIPE”) investors. In November 2020, in partial settlement of the CVR obligation, we issued 707,938 shares of common stock. In February 2021, we issued an additional 212,429 shares of common stock and paid $0.1 million in partial settlement of the CVR obligation.
On July 9, 2020, we completed a PIPE with existing and new investors to raise gross proceeds of $104.4 million, or net proceeds of $98.9 million after deducting commissions and offering costs, in which the investors were issued shares of Series A Preferred Stock at a price of $880 per share or, $3.52 per share on an as-converted-to-common basis.
Cumulatively, through December 31, 2021, 60,036 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, or 36.8% of the issued Series A Preferred Stock, have been converted into 15,009,000 shares of common stock. The 103,289 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding as of December 31, 2021 are convertible into 25,822,250 shares of common stock, for total common shares outstanding, on an as-converted basis, of 69,628,172.
On December 4, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of 11,794,872 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $9.75 per share. This included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their 30-day option to purchase up to 1,538,461 additional shares of common stock. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, were approximately $107.7 million.
On February 8, 2021, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC. The shelf registration statement allows the Company to sell from time-to-time up to $200.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants or units comprised of any combination of these securities, for its own account in one or more offerings. The terms of any offering under the shelf registration statement will be established at the time of such offering and will be described in a prospectus supplement filed with the SEC prior to the completion of any such offering.
Additionally, on February 8, 2021, pursuant to the Form S-3, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with SVB Leerink LLC (“SVB Leerink”), pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $75.0 million through SVB Leerink as the sales agent.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company sold 3,954,900 shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement with offering prices ranging between $9.25 and $10.30 per share for net proceeds of approximately $38.0 million.
Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Our net losses were $72.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to net losses of $74.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $271.0 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years. We expect that our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly if and as we:
•
initiate and increase enrollment for our existing and planned clinical trials for our product candidates;
•
continue to discover and develop additional product candidates, including through the creation of our research team in Boulder, CO, and build out our lab facility in Boulder, CO;
•
acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies;
•
maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•
hire additional research, clinical, scientific, and commercial personnel;
•
establish a commercial manufacturing source and secure supply chain capacity sufficient to provide commercial quantities of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval;
•
seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;
•
establish a sales, marketing, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval; and
•
add operational, financial, and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts.
We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates and do not enter into a commercialization partnership, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our internal commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing, and distribution.
As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $219.7 million. Based on our current plans, we expect that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2024.
The COVID-19 Pandemic
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, as a pandemic, which has spread throughout the United States and worldwide. We could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to an epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis, such as the recent outbreak of COVID-19 and variants thereof. We continue to monitor the pandemic and have taken steps to identify and mitigate the adverse impacts on, and risks to, our business posed by its spread and actions taken by governmental and
health authorities to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices, including implementing a work-from-home policy for all employees who are able to perform their duties remotely and restricting all nonessential travel, and we expect to continue to take actions as may be required or recommended by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, the patients we serve and other business partners in light of COVID-19. Given the fluidity of the COVID-19 pandemic however, we do not yet know the full extent of the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business operations. The ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of such epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis and actions taken to contain or prevent the further spread, among others. Accordingly, we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which our business, financial condition and results of operations will be affected. We will continue to work diligently with our partners and stakeholders to continue advancing our product candidate under regulatory review as well as in our clinical studies to the extent safe to do so for patients, caregivers and healthcare practitioners, and seeking to ensure the continuity of our manufacturing and supply chain.
Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenue
To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future. If our development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval or additional license or collaboration agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination of product sales or payments from additional collaboration or license agreements that we may enter into with third parties. We expect that our revenue for the next several years will be derived primarily from any collaborations that we may enter into in the future.
Operating Expenses
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, which include:
•
expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and contract research organizations (“CROs”);
•
the cost of manufacturing drug products for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”);
•
employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions;
•
laboratory supplies and animal care;
•
facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance; and
•
payments made under third-party licensing agreements.
We expense research and development costs as incurred. Advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.
Certain of our direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist of costs, such as fees paid to consultants, contractors, CMOs, and CROs in connection with our preclinical and clinical development activities. We do not allocate employee costs, costs associated with the manufacture bezuclastinib, costs associated with our discovery efforts, laboratory supplies, and facilities, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product development programs and, as such, are not separately classified.
Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our
research and development expenses will increase substantially in connection with our planned clinical and preclinical development activities in the near term and in the future. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing, and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of any of our product candidates. The successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the following:
•
the timing and progress of our preclinical and clinical development activities;
•
the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;
•
the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered, or may enter, into collaboration arrangements;
•
our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new ones;
•
our ability to establish new licensing or collaboration arrangements;
•
the future productivity of our research team in Boulder, CO and its ability to discover new product candidates and build our pipeline;
•
the successful completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability, and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority;
•
the receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•
the success in establishing and operating a manufacturing facility, or securing manufacturing supply through relationships with third parties;
•
our ability to obtain and maintain patents, trade secret protection, and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally;
•
our ability to protect our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;
•
the commercialization of our product candidates, if and when approved;
•
the acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, by patients, the medical community, and third-party payors;
•
competition with other products; and
•
a continued acceptable safety profile of our therapies following approval.
A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include direct and allocated facility-related costs as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations, accounting, and audit services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as of a result of the costs associated with the expansion of operations to support our on-going clinical and preclinical activities.
Acquired In-process Research and Development (IPR&D)
We expense acquired IPR&D in connection with an asset acquisition when there is no alternative future use, as determined by Management in accordance with GAAP.
Other Income (Expense)
Interest Income
Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash equivalents balances. Our interest income has not been significant due to low interest rates on invested balances.
Other Income
Other income consists of miscellaneous income and expense unrelated to our core operations, primarily income from subleasing a portion of our headquarters facilities.
Change in Fair Value of the CVR liability
This consists of changes in the fair value of the CVR liability.
Income Taxes
Since our inception, we have not recorded any current or deferred tax benefit for the net losses we have incurred in each year or for our research and development tax credits generated, as we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits will not be realized. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established against the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021. We reevaluate the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits at each reporting period. As of December 31, 2021, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $128.8 million and $47.1 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and begin to expire in 2035. Of the federal net operating loss carryforwards at December 31, 2021, $125.5 million is available to be carried forward indefinitely but can only offset 80% of taxable income per year. As of December 31, 2021, we also had U.S. federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $3.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and begin to expire in 2040 and 2035, respectively.
Utilization of the U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and corresponding provisions of state law, due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50% over a three-year period.
As a result of the shares issued in July 2020 related to the acquisition of Kiq and the sale of Series A Preferred Stock, the Company has experienced a change in ownership, as defined by Section 382. As a result of the ownership change, utilization of the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards is subject to annual limitation under Section 382. Under Section 382, the annual limitation is determined by first multiplying the value of the Company’s stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate, and then could be subject to additional adjustments, as required. This limitation resulted in the expiration of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards before utilization of $26.9 million and $79.5 million, respectively, and federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards before utilization of $6.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively. We have written off these gross deferred tax attributes, which were previously fully reserved for, in 2020. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $63.1 million and $3.0 million of federal and state net operating losses, respectively, as well as $10.6 million of future amortization for federal purposes were subject to the July 2020 limitation of $0.3 million per year. A second ownership change occurred in December 2020 as a result of the underwritten public offering of common stock which resulted in a limitation of tax attributes generated from July 7, 2020 to December 1, 2020. The December 1, 2020 ownership change is not expected to have a material impact to the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards as these net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may be utilized, subject to annual limitation, assuming sufficient taxable income is generated before expiration.
We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Collaboration Revenue
No collaboration revenue was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021. Collaboration revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020, was $7.9 million related to our legacy assets. All performance obligations were completed and all remaining revenue was recognized in 2020.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses were $55.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $25.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in research and development expense during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, is driven by costs associated with the manufacture and development of bezuclastinib and the development of the research pipeline, as well as higher personnel costs driven by an increase in headcount.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $19.6 million, compared to $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher personnel costs driven by an increase in headcount.
Acquired In-process Research and Development (IPR&D)
No acquired IPR&D was expensed during the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we expensed acquired IPR&D, with an estimated fair value of $46.9 million, including $2.1 million of associated transaction costs, in connection with the Kiq Acquisition.
Interest Income
Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $0.5 million, compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The impact of higher average invested balances in the current year was partially offset by lower interest rates in the current year compared to the prior period.
Gain on disposal of long-lived assets
No disposals of long-lived assets occurred in the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a gain on disposal of long-lived assets of $7.5 million, representing the net proceeds of the sale of BOXR Platform assets as well as the proceeds from the sale of other long-lived assets.
Other Income
Other income, net was $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Other income represents sublease income recognized resulting from the sublease of a portion of our leased office space.
Change in fair value of CVR liability
The change in fair value of CVR liability for the year ended December 31, 2021, represents the remeasurement of the CVR liability as a result of changes in our stock price prior to issuance of the common stock issued in partial settlement of the CVR.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have incurred certain costs related to the COVID-19 outbreak as a result of taking necessary precautions for essential personnel to operate safely both in person as well as remotely. Costs incurred include items like incremental payroll costs, consulting support, IT infrastructure and facilities related costs. The estimated impact of COVID-19 is currently unknown. The final impact may vary based on the duration of the current social and economic conditions. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic continues, it may materially impact our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations in the future. We do not currently believe the accumulated costs will present a material impact to our financial liquidity or position.
Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We have generated limited revenue to date from funding arrangements with our former collaboration partner. We have not yet commercialized any of our product candidates and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any product candidates for several years, if at all. We have historically funded our operations primarily through the public offering and private placement of our securities and consideration received from our collaborative agreements.
On July 9, 2020, we completed a PIPE and issued 118,638 Series A Preferred Stock to new and existing investors in exchange gross proceeds of $104.4 million, or net proceeds of $98.9 million, after deducting commissions and offering costs.
On December 4, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of 11,794,872 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $9.75 per share (including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their 30-day option to purchase up to 1,538,461 additional shares of common stock), or net proceeds from the offering of $107.7 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company sold 3,954,900 shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement with SVB Leerink with offering prices ranging between $9.25 and $10.30 per share for net proceeds of approximately $38.0 million
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $219.7 million, which we believe will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2024.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:
Operating Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, operating activities used $58.8 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $72.3 million, partially offset by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $2.0 million and net non-cash charges of $11.5 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted primarily of a $0.2 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $2.1 million decrease in operating lease liabilities and a $3.7 million decrease in other assets, partially offset by $6.2 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and a $1.8 million increase in the right-of-use asset.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, operating activities used $35.9 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $74.8 million and from net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $5.3 million, partially offset by net non-cash charges of $44.3 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of a $4.8 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, a $1.3 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $1.5 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a $0.8 million decrease in operating lease liabilities, partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $0.7 million decrease in the right-of-use asset, and a $0.4 million decrease in other assets.
Changes in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets in all periods were generally due to changes in our business, the advancement of our product candidates, and the timing of vendor invoicing and payments.
Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in investing activities was $1.7 million, consisting of purchases of property and lab equipment.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by investing activities was $8.4 million, which consisted of $8.1 million in proceeds from the disposal of the BOXR Platform as well as $0.3 million in proceeds from the sale of other property and equipment.
Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $38.0 million which consisted of $38.0 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the ATM, $0.1 million from the issuance of common stock upon stock option exercises and from the issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. This is offset by $0.1 million in payments to CVR holders.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $232.2 million which consisted of $107.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock in underwritten public offering, net of issuance costs, $98.9 million in proceeds from the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock and common stock, net of issuance costs, $25.0 million from the issuance of common stock to LPC, $0.5 million from the issuance of common stock upon stock option exercises, and $0.1 million from the issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
Funding Requirements
We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the clinical development of our current and any future product candidates and conduct additional research, development and preclinical activities. The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on:
•
the initiation, progress, timing, and completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our current and future potential product candidates, including the impact of COVID-19 on our ongoing and planned research and development efforts;
•
any delay in our regulatory filings for our product candidates and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the applicable regulatory authority’s review of such filings, including without limitation the FDA’s issuance of a “refusal to file” letter or a request for additional information;
•
adverse results or delays in clinical trials;
•
our decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial, or to terminate an existing clinical trial;
•
adverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval of our product candidates;
•
changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals;
•
adverse developments concerning our manufacturers;
•
our inability to obtain adequate product supply for any approved product or our inability to do so at acceptable prices;
•
our inability to establish collaborations, if desired or needed;
•
our failure to commercialize our product candidates;
•
the cost and timing of completion of the build out of our new office and laboratory facility in Boulder, CO;
•
additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;
•
unanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of our product candidates; and
•
the impact of COVID-19 on the operations of key governmental agencies, such as the FDA, which may delay the development of our current product candidates or any future product candidates.
Based on our current plans, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents of $219.7 million as of December 31, 2021 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2024. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. The Company will require additional funding to complete the critical activities planned to support ongoing research and development programs.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, existing ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of common stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or drug candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our research, product development, or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market drug candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We believe that of our critical accounting policies described under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following involve the most judgment and complexity:
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Accrued Research and Development Expenses
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically
confirm the accuracy of the estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:
•
vendors in connection with the preclinical development activities;
•
CMOs in connection with the production of preclinical and clinical trial materials;
•
CROs in connection with preclinical studies and clinical trials; and
•
investigative sites in connection with clinical trials.
We base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CMOs and CROs that supply, conduct, and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract, and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period.
Asset Acquisitions
We measure and recognize asset acquisitions that are not deemed to be business combinations based on the cost to acquire the assets, which includes transaction costs. Goodwill is not recognized in asset acquisitions. In an asset acquisition, the cost allocated to acquire IPR&D with no alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date.
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees, non-employees and directors based on their fair value on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We apply the straight-line method of expense recognition to all awards with only service-based vesting conditions and apply the graded-vesting method to all awards with performance-based vesting conditions or to awards with both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions.
We estimate the fair value of our stock-based awards to employees and non-employees using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including (a) the expected volatility of our stock, (b) the expected term of the award, (c) the risk-free interest rate, and (d) expected dividends. Due to the lack of a sufficient history of public trading of our common stock and a lack of sufficient company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in a similar stage of development as us and that are publicly traded. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available. We have estimated the expected term of our employee stock options using the "simplified" method, whereby, the expected term equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected life of the option are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect during the period the options were granted. The expected dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We account for forfeitures as they occur.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.
