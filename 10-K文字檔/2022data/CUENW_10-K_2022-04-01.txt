OUTLOOK
Business Environment
We are a technology payment platform company that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of under-bank and unbanked individuals. We believe in providing simple, affordable, secure and reliable financial services and digital payments to help our customers to achieve their financial goals. We strive to increase our relevance for consumers, and family to access and move their money anywhere in the world, anytime, on any platform and through any device (e.g., mobile, tablets, personal computers or wearables). We provide safer and simpler ways for businesses of all sizes to accept payments from merchant websites, mobile devices and applications, and at offline retail locations through a wide range of payment solutions. We also facilitate person to person payments through Cuentas GPR Card.
We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry. That focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy and consumer protection. Some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently and the laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. Non-compliance with laws and regulations, increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation, and the enactment of new laws and regulations applicable to us could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, we monitor these areas closely to ensure compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us.
Industry Trends
Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Cuentas, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to anticipate the changing demands of customers, industry trends and competitive forces.

Such options can be exercised until, November 2, 2031, and were approved by the Company’s shareholders on December 15, 2021. The increase in the other operating expenses is mainly due to an increase in the agreed Incomm payment in the amount of $429,000 to $590,000 in 2021, increase in the agreed maintenance and support services in accordance with the software maintenance agreement with CIMA in the amount of $200,000 to $700,000 in 2021, increase in our D&O insurance expenses in the amount of $513,000 to $513,000 in 2021, settlement expense in the amount of $625,000 (mainly due to the Secure IP legal matter and Kolb and Vitco lawsuit as mentioned aforesaid) in 2021 and increase in our compensation and director fees in the approximate amount of $340,000 to $1,519,000 in 2021.

The amortization expense mainly stems from the one-time licensing fee in the amount of $9,000,000 that was paid in shares to Cima, on December 31, 2019.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures.

To date, we have principally financed our operations through the sale of our Common Stock. Nevertheless, management anticipates that cash resources will be available to the Company from generating anticipated net income from the sales of General Purpose Reloadable Cards, digital content and the sale of our Common Stock in future financings. Therefore, we believe that existing cash and financings will be sufficient to fund planned operations and investments through the next 12 months. There can be no assurance, however, that the company will be successful in raising additional capital or that the company will have net income from operations to fund the business plan of the company
