ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains “forward-looking statements” that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs, and expected performance. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
Overview
We are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin in West Texas. We operate in two operating segments: (i) the upstream segment, which is engaged in the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves primarily in the Permian Basin in West Texas and (ii) through our subsidiary, Rattler, the midstream operations segment, which is focused on ownership, operation, development and acquisition of the midstream infrastructure assets in the Midland and Delaware Basins of the Permian Basin.
We operate under a strategic approach that focuses predominantly on enhancing return through our low-cost development strategy of resource conversion, capital allocation and continued improvements in operational and cost efficiencies. We are also committed to delivering results in a socially and environmentally responsible manner.
2021 Financial and Operating Highlights
•We recorded net income of $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021.
•Our average production was 137,002 MBOE/d during the year ended December 31, 2021.
•During the year ended December 31, 2021, we drilled 175 gross horizontal wells in the Midland Basin and 41 gross horizontal wells in the Delaware Basin.
•We turned 275 gross operated horizontal wells (including 207 in the Midland Basin and 64 in the Delaware Basin) to production and had capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, of $1.5 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021.
•The average lateral length for the wells completed during the year ended December 31, 2021 was 10,602 feet.

2021 Transactions and Recent Developments
2021 Acquisition Activity and Recent Transactions
On February 26, 2021, we completed the Guidon Acquisition, which included approximately 32,500 net acres in the Northern Midland Basin, in exchange for 10.68 million shares of the Company’s common stock and $375 million of cash.
On March 17, 2021, we completed the QEP Merger. The addition of QEP’s assets increased our net acreage in the Midland Basin by approximately 49,000 net acres. Under the terms of the merger agreement, we issued approximately 12.12 million shares of our common stock to the former QEP stockholders, with a total value of approximately $987 million on the closing date.
On October 1, 2021, Viper completed the acquisition of certain mineral and royalty interests from Swallowtail Royalties LLC and Swallowtail Royalties II LLC (the “Swallowtail entities”) which included certain mineral and royalty interests for 15.25 million of Viper’s common units and approximately $225 million in cash (the “Swallowtail Acquisition”). The cash portion of the purchase price was funded through a combination of cash on hand and approximately $190 million of borrowings under Viper LLC’s revolving credit facility.
On October 5, 2021, Rattler and a private affiliate of an investment fund formed a joint venture entity, Remuda Midstream Holdings LLC (the “WTG joint venture”). Rattler contributed approximately $104 million in cash for a 25% membership interest in the WTG joint venture, which then completed the acquisition of a majority interest in WTG Midstream LLC (“WTG Midstream”).
2021 Divestiture Activity
On June 3, 2021 and June 7, 2021, respectively, we closed transactions to divest certain non-core Permian assets, including over 7,000 net acres of non-core Southern Midland Basin acreage in Upton county, Texas and approximately 1,300 net acres of non-core, non-operated Delaware Basin assets in Lea county, New Mexico, for combined net cash proceeds of $82 million, after customary closing adjustments. We used our net proceeds from these transactions toward debt reduction.
On October 21, 2021, we completed the divestiture of our Williston Basin oil and natural gas assets, consisting of approximately 95,000 net acres acquired in the QEP Merger, for net cash proceeds of approximately $586 million after customary closing adjustments. We used our net proceeds from this transaction toward debt reduction.
On November 1, 2021, we completed the sale of certain gas gathering assets to Brazos Delaware Gas, LLC, which we refer to as Brazos, for net cash proceeds of approximately $54 million, after customary closing adjustments.
On December 1, 2021, we completed the sale of certain water midstream assets with a carrying value of approximately $160 million to Rattler in exchange for cash proceeds of approximately $160 million.
On November 1, 2021, Rattler completed the sale of its gas gathering assets to Brazos for net cash proceeds of approximately $83 million at closing, after customary closing adjustments, and an aggregate of $10 million in contingent payments.
See Note 4-Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional discussion of these transactions.
Debt Transactions
Issuances of Notes
On March 24, 2021, Diamondback Energy, Inc. issued $650 million aggregate principal amount of 0.900% Senior Notes due March 24, 2023 (the “2023 Notes”), $900 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% Senior Notes due March 24, 2031 (the “2031 Notes”) and $650 million aggregate principal amount of 4.400% Senior Notes due March 24, 2051 (the “2051 Notes”) and received proceeds, net of $24 million in debt issuance costs and discounts, of $2.18 billion. The net proceeds were primarily used to fund the redemption of other senior notes outstanding as discussed further below.
Redemption of Notes
The net proceeds from the March 2021 Notes discussed above were primarily used to fund the repurchase of $1.65 billion in fair value carrying amount of the QEP Notes that remained outstanding at the effective time of the QEP Merger for total cash consideration of $1.7 billion, and $368 million principal amount of 2025 Senior Notes, for total cash consideration of $381 million. Giving effect to the repurchase of the 2023 Notes discussed below, these refinancing transactions are expected to result in an estimated annual interest cost savings of approximately $40 million in addition to an estimated $60 to $80 million of previously announced expected annual cost synergies from the QEP Merger.
In June 2021, we redeemed the remaining $191 million principal amount of outstanding legacy 4.625% senior notes due September 1, 2021 of Energen Corporation (“Energen”).
In August 2021 we redeemed the remaining $432 million principal amount of our outstanding 5.375% 2025 Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 102.688% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. We funded the redemption with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
On November 1, 2021, we redeemed the aggregate $650 million principal amount of our outstanding 2023 Notes with the proceeds received from the divestiture of our Williston Basin assets and cash on hand.
For additional discussion of our 2021 debt transactions and the amendment to the second amended and restated credit facility, see Note 11-Debt.
Fourth Quarter 2021 Dividend Declaration and Increase
On February 18, 2022, our board of directors declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2021 of $0.60 per share of common stock, payable on March 11, 2022 to our stockholders of record at the close of business on March 4, 2022, representing a 20% increase per share from the previously paid quarterly dividend.
Stock and Unit Repurchase Programs
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased approximately $431 million of Diamondback common stock, and as of December 31, 2021, $1.6 billion remained available for future purchases under our common stock repurchase program.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, Viper repurchased approximately $46 million of common units under its repurchase program. As of December 31, 2021, $80 million remained available for use to repurchase common units under Viper’s common unit repurchase program.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, Rattler repurchased approximately $48 million of common units under its repurchase program. As of December 31, 2021, $88 million remained available for use to repurchase common units under Rattler’s common unit repurchase program.
See “-Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for additional discussion.
COVID-19 and Effects on Commodity Prices
In early March 2020, oil prices dropped sharply and continued to decline, briefly reaching negative levels, as a result of multiple factors affecting the supply and demand in global oil and natural gas markets, including (i) actions taken by OPEC members and other exporting nations impacting commodity price and production levels and (ii) a significant decrease in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand for oil and natural gas increased during 2021, as many restrictions on conducting business implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic were lifted due to improved treatments and availability of vaccinations in the U.S. and globally. As a result, oil and natural gas market prices have improved during 2021 in response to the increase in demand. During 2021 and 2020, the posted price for West Texas intermediate light sweet crude oil, or NYMEX WTI, has ranged from $(37.63) to $84.65 Bbl, and the NYMEX Henry Hub price of natural gas has ranged from $1.48 to $6.31 per MMBtu. On January 18, 2022, the closing NYMEX WTI price for crude oil was $85.43 per Bbl and the closing NYMEX Henry Hub price of natural gas was $4.28 per MMBtu. The emergence of the Delta COVID-19 variant in the latter part of 2021 and the subsequent surge of the highly transmissible Omicron variant, however, contributed to economic and pricing volatility as industry and market participants evaluated industry conditions and production outlook. Further, on January 4, 2021, OPEC and its non-OPEC allies, known collectively as OPEC+, agreed to continue their program (commenced in August of 2021) of gradual monthly output increases in February 2022, raising its output target by 400,000 Bbls per day, which is expected to further boost oil supply in response to rising demand. In its report issued on February 10, 2022, OPEC noted its expectation that world oil demand will rise by 4.15 million Bbls per day in 2022, as the global economy continues to post a strong recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Although this demand outlook is expected to underpin oil prices, already seen at a seven-year high in February 2022, we cannot predict any future volatility in commodity prices or demand for crude oil.
Despite the recovery in commodity prices and rising demand, we kept our production relatively flat during 2021, using excess cash flow for debt repayment and/or return to our stockholders rather than expanding our drilling program.
Outlook
During 2021, we continued building on our execution track record, generating free cash flow while keeping capital costs under control, and our efficiency gains, particularly in the Midland Basin drilling and completion programs, were able to mitigate certain inflationary pressures on well costs and led to a total capital expenditure amount of $1.5 billion down 11% from our guidance presented in April of 2021. We expect to continue to build on these operational efficiencies by controlling the variable portion of our operating and capital costs, which we believe will help mitigate the inflationary pressures seen across our business. We remain committed to capital discipline by maintaining flat oil production in 2022 and expect to maintain our best-in-class capital efficiency and cost structure. We expect to be in a position to continue to deliver on the recently announced enhanced capital return program, where we expect to distribute at least 50% of our quarterly free cash flow to our stockholders. Our capital return program is currently focused on our sustainable and growing dividend and a combination of stock repurchases and variable dividends. We expect to remain flexible on returning capital to our stockholders, depending on which method our board of directors believes presents the best return of capital to our stockholders at the relevant time.
In the Midland Basin, we continued to have positive results across our core development areas located within Midland, Martin, Howard, Glasscock and Andrews counties, where development has primarily focused on drilling long-lateral, multi-well pads targeting the Spraberry and Wolfcamp formations.
In the Delaware Basin, we have now drilled and completed a significant number of wells in Pecos, Reeves and Ward counties targeting the Wolfcamp A, which we believe has been de-risked across a significant portion of our total acreage position and remains our primary development target. In 2022, we expect to focus development on these areas.
As of December 31, 2021, we were operating 10 drilling rigs and four completion crews and currently intend to operate between 10 and 12 drilling rigs and between three and four completion crews in 2022 on average across our current acreage position in the Midland and Delaware Basins.
Environmental Responsibility Initiatives and Highlights
In February 2021, we announced significant enhancements to our commitment to environmental, social responsibility and governance, or ESG, performance and disclosure, including Scope 1 and methane emission intensity reduction targets. Our goals include the reduction of our Scope 1 greenhouse gas intensity by at least 50% and methane intensity by at least 70%, in each case by 2024 from the 2019 levels. To further underscore our commitment to carbon neutrality, we have also implemented our “Net Zero Now” initiative under which, effective January 1, 2021, we strive to produce every hydrocarbon molecule with zero Scope 1 emissions. To the extent our greenhouse gas and methane intensity targets do not eliminate our carbon footprint, we have purchased carbon credits to offset the remaining emissions. We have also increased the weighting of ESG metrics in our annual short-term incentive compensation plan to motivate our executives to advance our environmental responsibility goals.
In September 2021, we announced our long-term goal to end routine flaring by 2025 and a long-term target to source over 65% of our water used for drilling and completion operations from recycled sources by 2025. With respect to flaring, we flared 1.55% of our gross natural gas production in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year ended 2021, we flared 1.45% of our gross natural gas production, down 26% from 2020.
2022 Capital Budget
We have currently budgeted 2022 total capital spend of $1.75 billion to $1.90 billion. Should commodity prices weaken, we intend to act responsibly and, consistent with our prior practices, reduce capital spending. If commodity prices strengthen, we intend to maintain flat oil production, pay down indebtedness and return cash to our stockholders.
Results of Operations
The following discussion focuses primarily on a comparison of the results of operations between the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The midstream operations segment’s revenues and operating expenses were not significant to our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. .For a discussion of the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, please refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (filed with the SEC on February 25, 2021), which is incorporated in this report by reference from such prior report on Form 10-K.
The following table sets forth selected historical operating data for the periods indicated:
(1)Bbl equivalents are calculated using a conversion rate of six Mcf per Bbl.
(2)Hedged prices reflect the effect of our commodity derivative transactions on our average sales prices and include gains and losses on cash settlements for matured commodity derivatives, which we do not designate for hedge accounting. Hedged prices exclude gains or losses resulting from the early settlement of commodity derivative contracts.
Production Data
Substantially all of our revenues are generated through the sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production. The following tables provides information on the mix of our production for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids Revenues. Our revenues are a function of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes.
Our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues increased by approximately $4.0 billion, or 145%, to $6.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. Higher average oil prices, and to a lesser extent natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, contributed $3.3 billion of the total increase. The remainder of the overall change is due to a 25% increase in combined volumes sold.
Higher commodity prices during 2021 compared to 2020 primarily reflect a recovery from historically low prices experienced in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic as discussed in “-2021 Transactions and Recent Developments” above. The increase in production for 2021 compared to 2020 resulted primarily from the Guidon Acquisition and QEP Merger during the first quarter of 2021 and an overall recovery in our drilling and production activities after curtailments in the second quarter of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect to hold our oil production levels flat during 2022.
Lease Operating Expenses. The following table shows lease operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Lease operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $140 million, or $0.25 per BOE, primarily due to an increase in production between periods driven by the Guidon Acquisition and the QEP Merger in the first quarter of 2021. The increase on a per BOE basis is primarily related to the Williston Basin assets acquired in the QEP Merger which had higher lease operating costs per BOE on average than our historical properties. We completed the divestiture of the Williston Basin properties in October 2021.
Including the impact of our acquisition and divestiture activity in 2021 and future production plans, our total lease operating expenses in 2022 are expected to range from approximately $539 million to $618 million.
Production and Ad Valorem Tax Expense. The following table shows production and ad valorem tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
In general, production taxes are directly related to production revenues. Production taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $214 million, or $1.32 per BOE. The increase in production taxes is attributable to an increase in commodity prices, as well as an increase in overall production due to assets acquired in 2021. The current year increase on a per BOE basis is primarily driven by an increase in current year commodity prices. Production taxes as a percentage of production revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to the acquired Williston Basin properties which have a higher production tax rate than our other properties. We completed the divestiture of the Williston Basin properties in October 2021.
Ad valorem taxes are based, among other factors, on property values driven by prior year commodity prices. Ad valorem taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $16 million primarily due to additional properties acquired in the Guidon Acquisition and the QEP Merger.
We expect production taxes to be approximately between 7% and 8% of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenue during 2022.
Gathering and Transportation Expense. The following table shows gathering and transportation expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the increase for gathering and transportation expenses are primarily attributable to the increase in production between periods. The current year increase on a per BOE basis is primarily driven by production added from the assets acquired in the QEP Merger which, in general, had higher average gathering and transportation costs per BOE than our historical properties, particularly those QEP assets located in the Williston Basin, which we divested in the fourth quarter of 2021. After giving effect to the 2021 acquisition and divestiture activities, we expect gathering and transportation expenses to range from approximately $212 to $243 million in 2022.
Midstream Services Expense. The following table shows midstream services expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Midstream services expense represents costs incurred to operate and maintain our oil and natural gas gathering and transportation systems, natural gas lift, compression infrastructure and water transportation facilities. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we and Rattler divested our natural gas gathering and transportation assets. Midstream services expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $16 million primarily due to decreased maintenance costs, partially offset by increased fees for use of third party disposal systems.
Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion. The following table provides the components of our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
The decrease in depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties of $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 resulted primarily from a reduction in the average depletion rate partially offset by increased production in 2021. The decline in rate resulted primarily from higher SEC oil prices utilized in the reserve calculations during 2021, lengthening the economic life of the reserve base and resulting in higher projected remaining reserve volumes on our wells.
Impairment of Oil and Natural Gas Properties. No impairment expense was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021. In connection with the QEP Merger and the Guidon Acquisition, we recorded the oil and natural gas properties acquired at fair value. Pursuant to SEC guidance, we determined the fair value of the properties acquired in the QEP Merger and the Guidon Acquisition clearly exceeded the related full cost ceiling limitation beyond a reasonable doubt. As such, we requested and received a waiver from the SEC to exclude the acquired properties from the first quarter 2021 ceiling test calculation. As a result, no impairment expense related to the QEP Merger and the Guidon Acquisition was recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Had we not received the waiver from the SEC, an impairment charge of approximately $1.1 billion would have been recorded in the first quarter of 2021. The properties acquired in the QEP Merger and the Guidon Acquisition had total unamortized costs at March 31, 2021 of $3.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.
As a result of the sharp decline in commodity prices during 2020, we recorded non-cash ceiling test impairments for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $6.0 billion which is included in accumulated depletion, depreciation, amortization and impairment on our consolidated balance sheet. Impairment charges affect our results of operations but do not reduce our cash flow. In addition to commodity prices, our production rates, levels of proved reserves, future development costs, transfers of unevaluated properties and other factors will determine our actual ceiling test calculation and impairment analysis in future periods. If the trailing 12-month commodity prices fall as compared to the commodity prices used in prior quarters, we may have material write-downs in subsequent quarters. See Note 8-Property and Equipment for further details regarding factors that impact the impairment of oil and natural gas properties.
General and Administrative Expenses. The following table shows general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $58 million primarily due to additional payroll and other employee driven costs of $32 million related to the QEP Merger and the Guidon Acquisition as well as $10 million of additional expense related to the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system. Additionally, equity compensation for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $14 million compared to the same period in 2020.
We expect cash general and administrative expenses to range from approximately $87 million to $110 million in 2022, and non-cash stock-based compensation to range from approximately $54 million to $69 million in 2022.
Merger and Integration Expense. The following table shows merger and integration expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Total merger and integration expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes $69 million in costs incurred for the QEP Merger and $9 million in costs incurred for the Guidon Acquisition. The QEP Merger related expenses primarily consist of $39 million in severance costs and $30 million in banking, legal and advisory fees, and the Guidon Acquisition related expenses consist primarily of advisory and legal fees. See Note 4-Acquisitions and Divestitures for further details regarding the QEP Merger and the Guidon Acquisition.
Net Interest Expense. The following table shows net interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Net interest expense increased by $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase primarily consisted of (i) $47 million in interest costs on the newly issued March 2021 Notes (ii) $25 million due to incurring a full year of interest expense in 2021 related to our May 2020 Notes and Rattler’s 5.625% Senior Notes due 2025, and (iii) to a lesser extent, interest expense incurred on the QEP Notes that remained outstanding following the QEP Merger completed in March 2021. These increases were partially offset by (i) $33 million in additional capitalized interest costs, (ii) interest cost savings of $23 million on the repurchases of our 2025 Senior Notes in March 2021 and August 2021, (iii) $8 million on the repurchase of our 4.625% senior notes of Energen (iv) a $9 million reduction in borrowings under our revolving credit agreements during 2021, and (v) to a lesser extent, interest savings on the repurchase of our 2023 Notes in November 2021. We expect interest expense, net of interest income to range from approximately $148 million to $178 million in 2022. See Note 11-Debt for further details regarding outstanding borrowings and interest expense.
Derivative Instruments. The following table shows the net gain (loss) on derivative instruments and the net cash received (paid) on settlements of derivative instruments for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
(1)The year ended December 31, 2021 includes cash paid on commodity contracts terminated prior to their contractual maturity of $16 million.
(2)The year ended December 31, 2020 includes cash received on commodity contracts terminated prior to their contractual maturity of $17 million.
(3)The year ended December 31, 2021 includes cash received on interest rate swap contracts terminated prior to their contractual maturity of $80 million.
We are required to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value. We have not designated our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes. As a result, we mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the cash and non-cash changes in fair value on derivative instruments in our consolidated statements of operations under the line item captioned “Gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net.” As part of the QEP Merger, we received by novation from QEP certain derivative instruments which are included on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.
We have designated certain of our interest rate swaps as fair value hedges for accounting purposes. As a result, gains and losses due to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps completely offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt and no gain or loss is recognized due to hedge effectiveness. Changes in fair value are recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the 2029 Notes in the consolidated balance sheet. Beginning on December 1, 2021, we began recording semi-annual cash settlements of these interest rate swaps in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
At December 31, 2021, we have a short-term derivative asset of $13 million, a long-term derivative asset of $4 million, a short-term derivative liability due in 2022 of $174 million and a long-term derivative liability due in 2023 of $29 million.
Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes. The following table shows the provision for (benefit from) income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
The changes in our income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 were primarily due to the increase in pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview of Sources and Uses of Cash
Historically, our primary sources of liquidity include cash flows from operations, proceeds from our public equity offerings, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and sales of non-core assets. Our primary uses of capital have been for the acquisition, development and exploration of oil and natural gas properties. At December 31, 2021, we had approximately $2.2 billion of liquidity consisting of $0.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.6 billion available under our credit facility. As discussed below, our capital budget for 2022 is $1.75 billion to $1.90 billion. Further, we have $45 million of senior notes maturities in the next 12 months.
Our working capital requirements are supported by our cash and cash equivalents and our credit facility. We may draw on our revolving credit facility to meet short-term cash requirements, or issue debt or equity securities as part of our longer-term liquidity and capital management program. Because of the alternatives available to us as discussed above, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity are adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, dividend payments, debt service obligations and repayment of debt maturities, stock repurchase program and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.
Future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices, and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties. In order to mitigate this volatility, we entered into derivative contracts with a number of financial institutions, all of which are participants in our credit facility, hedging a portion of our estimated future crude oil and natural gas production through the end of 2023 as discussed further in Note 15-Derivatives and
