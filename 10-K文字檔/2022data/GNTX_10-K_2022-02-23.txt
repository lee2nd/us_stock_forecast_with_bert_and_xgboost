Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Results of Operations
The following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items from the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of net sales and the percentage change in the dollar amount of each such item from that in the indicated previous year.
Results of Operations: 2021 to 2020
Net Sales. In 2021, the Company's net sales increased by $43.0 million, or 3% compared to the prior year. Net sales for 2021 were negatively impacted by lower than forecasted global vehicle production rates for calendar year 2021, which declined 3% on a year over year basis. The increase in the Company's sales was primarily driven by a 9% year over year increase in automatic-dimming mirror shipments, from 38.2 million units in 2020 to 41.8 million units in 2021, despite the electronics components shortages impacting the Company's ability to meet customer demand for Full Display Mirror® (FDM), Integrated Toll Module (ITM), and other advanced feature shipments.
Other net sales for calendar year 2021 were $34.0 million, compared to Other net sales of $40.0 million in calendar year 2020. Fire protection sales increased by 10% year over year, while dimmable aircraft windows were down 48% in 2021 compared to calendar year 2020. The Company expects that dimmable aircraft window sales will continue to be impacted until there is a more meaningful recovery of the aerospace industry and the Boeing 787 production levels improve.
Cost of Goods Sold. As a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold increased from 64.1% in 2020 to 64.2% in 2021. The year over year decrease in the gross margin was primarily the result of annual customer price reductions and freight related cost increases, which were mostly offset by purchasing cost reductions and product mix improvement over 2020. On a year over year basis, annual customer price reductions and freight related cost increases each had a negative impact of approximately 100 - 150 basis points on gross margin. Purchasing cost reductions and product mix improvements in 2021 versus 2020 each independently had a positive impact on gross margin on a year over year basis of approximately 50 - 100 basis points.
Operating Expenses. Engineering, research and development expenses ("E, R & D") increased by $1.8 million or 2% from 2020 to 2021, but remained at 7% of net sales. E, R & D increased, primarily due to increased staffing levels, which continue to support growth and development of new business.
Selling, general and administrative ("S, G & A") expenses increased by $2.2 million or 2% from 2020 to 2021, but remained at 5% of net sales. The primary reason for the increase in S, G & A from 2020 to 2021 was due to wages and benefits, other resources associated with mitigation of the impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic, and increased legal and professional fees.
Total Other Income/(Expense). Investment income decreased $3.4 million to $3.6 million for 2021 compared to $7.0 million for 2020 primarily due to decreases in interest income from fixed income investments. Other income - net decreased $2.3 million in 2021 versus 2020, primarily due to decreases in gains on sales of debt investments on a year over year basis, as well as gains recognized in 2020 on initial investments that were fully acquired during 2020.
Taxes. The effective tax rate was 13.3% for year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 15.6% for the prior year. The effective tax rates in 2021 and 2020 differed from the statutory federal income tax rate, primarily due to the Foreign Derived Intangible Income Deduction, research and development tax credits and discrete benefits from stock based compensation.
Net Income. Net income increased by $13.2 million, or 4% year over year, primarily due to the 3% increase in revenue on a year over year basis, as well as the decrease in the effective tax rate.
Results of Operations: 2020 to 2019
Net Sales. In 2020, Company net sales decreased by $170.7 million, or 9% compared to the prior year. Net sales for 2020 were negatively impacted by lower than forecasted global vehicle production rates for calendar year 2020, which were down 16% on a year over year basis. The reduction in global light vehicle production and the Company's sales was impacted primarily a result of the global shutdowns as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which primarily impacted the Company in the second quarter of 2020. Automotive net sales decreased as a result of an 11% decrease in automatic-dimming mirror shipments, from 42.9 million units in 2019 to 38.2 million units in 2020.
Other net sales decreased 17% to $40.0 million compared to the prior year, as dimmable aircraft window sales decreased 30% year over year and fire protection saw a decrease in net sales of 4% year over year. Dimmable aircraft window sales were impacted by production challenges the Company's customer faced.
Cost of Goods Sold. As a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold increased from 63.0% in 2019 to 64.1% in 2020. The year over year decrease in the gross margin was primarily the result of the Company's inability to leverage fixed overhead during the second quarter of 2020 as a result of COVID-19 related shutdowns and decreases in demand, as well as annual customer price reductions, which were partially offset by improvements in product mix related to Full Display Mirror® as well as purchasing cost reductions and structural cost reductions. On a year over year basis, the inability to leverage fixed overhead and annual customer price reductions each had a negative impact of approximately 150 - 250 basis points on gross margin. Purchasing cost reductions, product mix improvements, and structural cost reductions each independently had a positive impact on gross margin on a period over period basis of approximately 50 - 100 basis points.
Operating Expenses. Engineering, research and development expenses increased by $1.2 million or 1% from 2019 to 2020, representing 7% of net sales in 2020 versus 6% of net sales in 2019. E, R & D increased, primarily due to certain severance related costs incurred in the second quarter of 2020, which were partially offset by lower overall expense levels as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $4.9 million or 6% from 2019 to 2020, but remained at 5% of net sales. The primary reason for the increase from 2019 to 2020 was due to severance related costs, wages and benefits, other resources associated with mitigation of the impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic, and increased legal and professional fees associated with acquisitions of new technology.
Total Other Income/(Expense). Investment income decreased $4.2 million to $7.0 million for 2020 compared to $11.2 million for 2019 primarily due to decreases in interest income from fixed income investments. Other income - net increased $4.6 million in 2020 versus 2019, primarily due to an increase in gains on sales of debt investments on a year over year basis, as well as gains recognized on initial investments that were fully acquired during 2020.
Taxes. The effective tax rate was 15.6% for year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 15.1% the prior year. The effective tax rates in 2020 and 2019 differed from the statutory federal income tax rate, primarily due to the Foreign Derived Intangible Income Deduction.
Net Income. Net income decreased by $77.1 million, or 18% year over year, primarily driven by the lower sales levels coming from the COVID-19 related shutdowns.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company’s financial condition throughout the periods presented has remained very strong, notwithstanding a 3% decline in light vehicle production in the Company's primary markets from 2020 to 2021 and a 16% decline from 2019 to 2020.
The Company's cash and cash equivalents were $262.3 million, $423.4 million and $296.3 million as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company's cash and cash equivalents include amounts held by foreign subsidiaries of $10.7 million, $7.4 million and $8.5 million as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The Company's current ratio was 4.8 as of December 31, 2021 and was 5.5 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Cash flow from operating activities was $362.2 million, $464.5 million and $506.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash flow from operating activities decreased $102.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year, primarily due to changes in working capital and deferred taxes, which were partially offset by the increase in net income. Cash flow from operating activities decreased $41.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to decreased net income driven from the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic and related shutdowns.
Cash flow used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $139.5 million to $113.1 million, compared with cash flow provided by investing activities of $26.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increased investment purchases of fixed income investments during the year. Cash flow provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $83.1 million to $26.4 million, compared to cash flow used for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to decreased investment purchases and additional maturities of fixed income investments during the year.
Capital expenditures were $68.8 million, $51.7 million, and $84.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $17.1 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to an increase in production equipment purchases. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $32.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of cost cutting initiatives and financial discipline in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Cash flow used for financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, increased $46.3 million to $410.1 million, compared to $363.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in the amount of shares of common stock repurchased which totaled $324.6 million during the calendar year 2021 as compared to $288.5 million during the calendar year 2020.
Cash flow used for financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased $6.1 million to $363.9 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a reduction in the amount of shares of common stock repurchased which totaled $288.5 million during the calendar year 2020 as compared to $331.5 million during the calendar year 2019.
Short-term investments as of December 31, 2021 were $5.4 million, down from $27.2 million as of December 31, 2020 and long-term investments were $207.7 million as of December 31, 2021, up from $162.0 million as of December 31, 2020, due to changes in the Company's overall investment portfolio.
Accounts receivable as of December 31, 2021 decreased $35.1 million compared to December 31, 2020, primarily due to the timing of sales within those years.
Inventories as of December 31, 2021, increased $90.0 million compared to December 31, 2020, primarily due to increased raw material inventory levels.
Intangible Assets, net as of December 31, 2021 decreased $10.6 million compared to December 31, 2020, due to the amortization of definite lived intangible assets and patents, which was offset by acquisitions of additional intangible assets during the year, which is discussed further in Note 10 and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Accounts payable as of December 31, 2021, increased $13.6 million compared to December 31, 2020, primarily due the timing of inventory and capital expenditure payments.
Management considers the Company’s current working capital and long-term investments, as well as its existing credit financing arrangement (notwithstanding covenants prohibiting additional indebtedness), discussed further in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, in addition to internally generated cash flow, to be sufficient to cover anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future considering its contractual obligations and commitments.
The following is a summary of working capital and long-term investments:
The decrease in working capital as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 is primarily due to decreases in cash flow from operations, as well as additional share repurchases. The increase in working capital as of December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily due to increased cash flow from operations, which was partially offset by share repurchases, dividend payments and capital expenditures.
Please refer to Part II, Item 5, with regard to the Company's previously announced share repurchase plan.
Outlook
The Company utilizes the light vehicle production forecasting services of IHS Markit. The IHS Markit mid-January 2022 forecast for light vehicle production for calendar year 2022 are approximately 15.2 million units for North America, 18.5 million units for Europe, 11.4 million units for Japan and Korea, and 24.3 million units for China.
Based on the foregoing, the Company estimates that top line revenue for calendar year 2022 will be between $1.87 and $2.02 billion. All estimates are based on light vehicle production forecasts in the primary regions to which the Company ships product, as well as the estimated option rates for its mirrors and electronics on prospective vehicle models and anticipated product mix. The Company continues to see order rates and booked business that allow for these estimates with an expected vehicle production increase in 2022, as well as an increase in 2023 compared to 2022. Continuing uncertainties, including: impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic and industry conditions, including impacts on customers, the supply chain, and the labor market; light vehicle production levels; supplier part or material shortages; automotive plant shutdowns; sales rates in Europe, Asia and North America; challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environments, including tariffs and potential tax law changes; OEM strategies and cost pressures; customer inventory management and the impact of potential automotive customer (including their Tier 1 suppliers) and supplier bankruptcies; work stoppages, strikes, etc., which could disrupt shipments to these customers, make forecasting difficult.
The Company is estimating that the gross margin will be between 35% and 36% for calendar year 2022. Historically, annual customer price reductions have placed significant pressure on gross margin on an annual basis. Given the current revenue forecast and projected product mix for 2022, the Company hopes it may be able to offset certain raw material cost increases, as well as labor related cost increases with lower than historical annual customer price reductions and and improved operational efficiencies, but there is no certainty of being able to do so.
The Company also currently estimates that its operating expenses, which include E, R & D and S, G & A, are expected to be between $230 and $240 million for calendar year 2022, due in part to continued investments that support growth and launch of new business as well as development of new products, which are primarily staffing related. The Company continues to invest heavily in technology directed at funding the development of its current product portfolio and create iterations of those products that help keep its products new and attractive to our customers.
The Company is a technology leader in the automotive industry, with a focus on developing uniquely designed solutions that are proprietary. The Company continues to make investments intended to maintain a competitive advantage in its current markets, as well as to use its core competencies to develop products that are applicable in other markets.
Based on current light vehicle production forecasts, and the resultant forecast our automatic-dimming mirrors and electronics, the Company currently anticipates that 2022 capital expenditures will be between $150 and $175 million, a majority of which will be production equipment purchases but also includes an estimated $60 - 65 million
in construction costs related to the construction of a new 345,000 square foot manufacturing facility, which began in January 2022. Capital expenditures for calendar year 2022 are currently anticipated to be financed from current cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flows from operating activities.
The Company also estimates that depreciation and amortization expense for calendar year 2022 will be between $100 and $110 million.
The Company is further estimating that its tax rate will be between 15.0% and 17.0% for calendar year 2022 based on the current statutory rates.
In accordance with its previously announced share repurchase plan and capital allocation strategy, the Company intends to continue to repurchase additional shares of its common stock in 2022 and into the future depending on a number of factors, including: market, economic, and industry conditions; the market price of the Company's common stock; anti-dilutive effect on earnings; available cash; and other factors that the Company deems appropriate.
The Company is also providing top line revenue guidance for calendar year 2023, taking into account anticipated increases in light vehicle production in 2023 compared to 2022. IHS Markit current forecasts for light vehicle production for calendar year 2023 are approximately 17.2 million units for North America, 20.1 million units for Europe, 11.9 million units for Japan and Korea, and 27.4 million units for China. Based on these forecasts, the Company is estimating that revenue for calendar year 2023 will increase approximately 15% to 20% over current estimates provided for 2022 revenue. As noted above, continuing uncertainties make forecasting difficult.
Market Risk Disclosure
The Company is subject to market risk exposures of varying correlations and volatilities, including foreign exchange rate risk, and interest rate risk. Fluctuating interest rates and securities prices could negatively impact the Company's financial performance due to realized losses on the sale of fixed income investments. The Company does not currently believe such risks are material.
The Company has some assets, liabilities and operations outside the United States, including multi-currency accounts, which currently are not significant overall to the Company as a whole. Because the Company sells its automotive mirrors throughout the world and automobile manufacturing is highly dependent on general economic conditions, it could be significantly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for its products.
Most of the Company’s non-U.S. sales are invoiced and paid in U.S. dollars. During calendar year 2021, approximately 8% of the Company’s net sales were invoiced and paid in foreign currencies (compared to 7% for calendar years 2020 and 2019). The Company currently expects that approximately 7-9% of the Company’s net sales in calendar year 2022 will be invoiced and paid in foreign currencies. The Company does not currently engage in hedging activities of foreign currencies.
The Company does not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements or commitments that have not been recorded in its Consolidated Financial Statements.
Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, requires management to make estimates, assumptions and apply judgments that affect its financial position and results of operations. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates these estimates and assumptions. Management also continually reviews its accounting policies and financial information disclosures.
The Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Certain of our accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions are based on our historical experience, the terms of existing contracts, our evaluation of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and suppliers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. However, these estimates and assumptions are inherently subject to a degree of uncertainty. As a result, actual results in these areas may differ significantly from our estimates, as is the case in any application of generally accepted accounting principles.
The Company considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:
• It requires management to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time of the estimate, and
• Changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Accordingly, revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for promised goods or services when it transfers those goods or services to customers. Sales are shown net of returns, which have not historically been significant. The Company does not generate sales from arrangements with multiple deliverables. The Company generally receives purchase orders from customers on an annual basis. Typically, such purchase orders provide the annual terms, including pricing, related to a particular vehicle model. Purchase orders generally do not specify quantities. The Company recognizes revenue based on the pricing terms included in such annual purchase orders.
As part of certain agreements, entered into in the ordinary course of business, the Company is asked to provide customers with annual price reductions. Such amounts are estimated and accrued as a reduction of revenue as products are shipped to those customers. For any shipments of product that may be subject to retroactive price adjustments that are then being negotiated, the Company records revenue based on the Company’s best estimate of the amount of consideration to which the entity will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods to the customer. The Company's best estimate requires significant judgment based on historical results and expected outcomes of ongoing negotiations with customers. The Company's approach is to consider these adjustments to the contract price as variable consideration which is estimated based on the then most likely price amount. In addition, the Company has ongoing adjustments to our pricing arrangements with customers based on the related content, the cost of our products and other commercial factors. Such pricing accruals are adjusted as they are settled with our customers.
