Recent Corporate Developments
Amendment to Equity Incentive Plan
On April 21, 2021, in connection with the Company being listed on the NEO Exchange in Canada and in order to comply with the corporate governance requirements of the NEO Exchange, amended and restated its 2020 Equity Incentive Plan to provide that stock options issued under the plan (i) may not be transferred and (ii) may not have an exercise price less than the fair market value (“FMV”) of such stock options as of the grant date. Pursuant to the A&R Plan (as defined below), FMV shall be determined as follows: (i) if the Company’s common stock is then listed or admitted to trading on a national stock exchange, the FMV shall be either (x) the five-day volume weighted average trading price, calculated by dividing the total value by the total volume of securities traded on a national stock exchange for the relevant period, or (y) the closing price of the Company’s common stock on a national stock exchange on the previous trading day prior to the date of grant of the award; or (y) if the Company’s common stock is not then listed or admitted to trading on a national stock exchange, the FMV shall be a price determined by the administrator of the A&R Plan in good faith using any reasonable method of valuation. In addition, the Company amended and restated the form agreements for awards made pursuant to the Company’s Amended and Restated 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the “A&R Plan”) to reflect the foregoing changes.
The Company’s A&R Plan and amended form award agreements were approved by the Company’s Board of Directors on April 21, 2021 and the Company’s stockholders on January 25, 2022.
Amendments to Bylaws - Adoption of Majority Voting Policy
On April 21, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), in connection with the Company being listed on the NEO Exchange in Canada and in order to comply with the corporate governance requirements of the NEO Exchange, approved and adopted a Majority Voting Policy for the election of directors (the “Policy”), which policy effectively alters the manner in which directors are elected under the Company’s Bylaws, and is therefore, subject to shareholder approval. The Company’s Stockholders approved the Policy and related changes to the Company’s Bylaws at a special meeting of stockholders on January 25, 2022.
Under the Policy, in an uncontested election, any director nominee who receives a greater number of votes “withheld” than votes “for” his or her election at a meeting of shareholders of the Company must promptly tender his or her resignation to the chairman of the Board. Following receipt of such resignation, the Governance Committee of the Board (the “Committee”) will consider the resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept such tendered resignation. Except in special circumstances, the Committee will be expected to accept and recommend acceptance of the resignation by the Board. A press release disclosing the Board’s determination (and the reasons for rejecting the resignation, if applicable) will be issued within 90 days following the date of the relevant meeting of shareholders and a copy of the press release will be sent concurrently to the NEO Exchange, provided that the Company’s common stock is then listed for trading on the NEO Exchange. The director’s resignation, if accepted, will become effective immediately upon acceptance thereof by the Board.
Any director who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to the Policy will not participate in the recommendation of the Committee or the decision of the Board with respect to such resignation.
Subject to any restrictions imposed by applicable law, where the Board accepts a resignation in accordance with the Policy, the Board may (i) leave the director vacancy unfilled until the next annual meeting of shareholders, (ii) fill the vacancy through the appointment of a new director, or (iii) call a special meeting of shareholders at which a new candidate will be presented to fill the vacant position.
The Policy applies only in circumstances involving an uncontested election of directors. For purposes of the Policy, an “uncontested election” of directors of the Company means an election held at any meeting of shareholders called for, either alone or with other matters, the election of directors, with respect to which the number of nominees for election is equal to the number of positions on the Board to be filled through the election to be conducted at such meeting.
AppLogiq Spin-Off
On December 15, 2021, we entered into various agreements with Lovarra, a Nevada corporation (“Lovarra”) and public reporting subsidiary of the Company, pursuant to which the Company agreed to transfer its AppLogiq business to Lovarra, subject to customary conditions and approvals and completion of requisite financial statement audits (the “Separation”). Lovarra is a fully reporting U.S. public company, which is approximately 78.5% owned by the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary GoLogiq LLC (“GoLogiq”). In connection with the Separation, the Company intends to distribute, on a pro rata basis, 100% of the Company’s ownership interests in Lovarra to the Company’s shareholders of record as of December 30, 2021 (the “Record Date”) (the “Distribution,” and collectively with the “Separation,” the “Spin Off”), which Distribution of said shares is expected to occur six months from completion of the Separation (the “Distribution Date”).
On January 27, 2022, we completed the transfer of our AppLogiq business to Lovarra. In connection with the completion of the transfer of AppLogiq to Lovarra, Lovarra issued 26,350,756 shares of its common stock to the Company (the “Lovarra Shares”). The Company will hold the Lovarra Shares until it distributes 100% of the Lovarra Shares to the Company’s stockholders of record as of December 30, 2021 on a 1-for-1 basis (i.e. for every 1 share of Logiq held on December 30, 2021, the holder thereof will receive 1 share of Lovarra), which the Company intends to complete approximately 6 months from now, subject to customary conditions and approvals.
Until such time as the Distribution is complete, we will consolidate and report the financials of the AppLogiq business as a consolidated subsidiary of Logiq.
COVID-19 Effect
Due to the unprecedented effect and related impact of Covid-19 pandemic, the Company has experienced a push back from the Company’s resellers and white label distributors from April 2020, for its Platform as a Service pay-to-use subscription basis. The Company is expecting an uncertain outlook in its service revenues, as its operations in South East Asia are currently being disrupted by the continuing impact of Covid-19 pandemic. In particular, our PAY/GOLogiq associate revenues have been reduced as offices and compulsory lock down protocols are being implemented, which are expected to be in force until the majority of the populous have been vaccinated through to the end of calendar year 2021.

Canadian Initial Public Offering (IPO)
On June 9, 2021, the Company entered into an Agency Agreement (the “Agency Agreement”) with Research Capital Corporation (the “Agent”) relating to a Canadian initial public offering (the “Offering”) by the Company of a minimum of 1,666,667 units of securities (each, a “Unit”), and a maximum of 3,333,333 Units, at a price of C$3.00 per Unit (the “Offering Price”), for minimum gross proceeds of C$5,000,000, and maximum gross proceeds of C$10,000,000. Each Unit consists of (i) one share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”, and the Common Stock included in a Unit being a “Unit Share”), and (ii) one Common Stock purchase warrant (each, a “Warrant”), where each Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one share of Common Stock (each, a “Warrant Share”) at an exercise price of C$3.50 per Warrant Share, subject to adjustment, at any time before the third anniversary (the “Warrant Expiry Date”) of June 17, 2021 (the “Closing Date”). The Warrants will be governed by a warrant indenture (the “Warrant Indenture”) between the Company and Odyssey Trust Company (the “Warrant Agent”). No Units will be issued, however, as the Units will be immediately separated and purchasers will receive only shares of Common Stock and Warrants. Furthermore, the Company agreed to issue 83,333 units of securities (the “Advisory Fee Units”) to the Agent as compensation for certain strategic advisory and support services rendered. This number was determined by dividing C$250,000 by the Offering Price.

Our sources of liquidity and cash flows are used to fund ongoing operations, research and development projects for new products and technologies, and provide ongoing support services for our customers. Over the next two fiscal years, we anticipate that we will use our liquidity and cash flows from our operations to fund our growth, particularly to grow our data sales. In addition, as part of our business strategy, we occasionally evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies, and minority equity investments. Accordingly, a portion of our available cash may be used at any time for the acquisition of complementary products or businesses or minority equity investments. Such potential transactions may require substantial capital resources, which may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates, complete acquisitions or investments, integrate acquired businesses into our current operations, or expand into new markets. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurances that additional financing will be available to us in any required time frame and on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
As of December 31, 2021, we currently have material commitments for capital expenditures. Our capex & R&D plans are dependent on the availability of working capital and is able to be scaled back as required.
We know of no material trends in our capital trends aside from the funds to be raised in future offerings. We have focused our resources behind a plan to grow our data sales, where we have a technology advantage and higher margins. If we are successful in implementing our plan, we expect to return to a positive cash flow from operations. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to achieve this objective.
We know of no trends or demands reasonably likely to affect liquidity other than those listed as Risk Factors.
The following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2010:
Operating Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, loss from operations used $(20,126,787), compared to $(14,509,669) for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we did use cash $933,682 for investing activities in the Company’s financial asset investment portfolio based and managed in the US.
Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated $15,885,352 from financing activities, compared to $8,687,759 of cash generated for the year ended December 31, 2021.
We estimate that based on current plans and assumptions, that our available cash and the cash we generate from our core operations will generally be sufficient to satisfy our capital expenditures under our present operating expectations, without further financing, for up to 12 months. We have sufficient working capital to fund the expansion of our operations and to provide working capital necessary for our ongoing operations and obligations. However, we shall continue to evaluate our capital expenditure needs based upon factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of our sales and marketing, the timing of new product introductions, and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services. If cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements, we may open a revolving line of credit with a bank, or we may have to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain expanded credit facilities to fund our operating expenses, pay our obligations, diversify our geographical reach, and grow our company. In the event such financing is needed in the future, there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us, or, if available, that it will be in amounts and on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them, our operations and prospects could be negatively affected. However, if cash flows from operations become insufficient to continue operations at the current level, and if no additional financing were obtained, then management would restructure the Company in a way to preserve its business while maintaining expenses within operating cash flows.
Known Trends or Uncertainties
We have seen some consolidation in the mobile applications industry during economic downturns. These consolidations have not had a negative effect on our total sales; however, should consolidations and downsizing in the industry continue to occur, those events could adversely impact our revenues and earnings going forward.
We believe that the need for improved productivity in the research and development activities directed toward developing new and enhanced PaaS applications will continue to result in SMBs utilizing our products and services. New product developments could result in increased revenues and earnings if they are accepted by our markets; however, there can be no assurances that new products will result in significant improvements to revenues or earnings. For competitive reasons, we do not disclose all of our new product development activities.
The potential for growth in new markets is uncertain. We will continue to explore these opportunities until such time as we either generate sales or determine that resources would be more efficiently used elsewhere.
Inflation
We have not been affected materially by inflation during the periods presented, and no material effect is expected in the near future.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We have no material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2021, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.
We do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationship with us or our related parties.
