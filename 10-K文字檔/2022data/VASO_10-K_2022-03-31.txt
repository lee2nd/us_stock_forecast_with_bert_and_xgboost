General Overview
COVID-19 pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the United States economy and it is possible that some negative impact to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations may continue. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate what the total impact may be. The pandemic has resulted in workforce and travel restrictions and created business disruptions in supply chain, production and demand across many business sectors. We have experienced the negative impact in the recurring revenue business in our IT segment as some of our customers have been adversely affected by the shutdown, and new business in this segment appears to be slower as well. The pandemic also may have a negative impact on our cash receipts as some customers request forbearance or a delay in their payments to us.
The pandemic may continue to impact our operations in 2022, depending on the duration of the pandemic and the timing and success of the reopening of the economy.
We have taken significant steps in our efforts to protect our workforce and our clients. Most of our employees have been working at least partially remotely and we have reopened our work sites consistent with the guidelines promulgated by the CDC and respective state governments. In addition, the Company in 2020 received a $3.6 million loan under the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act (the “PPP loan”). This loan was used to principally cover our payroll costs for a period of time as specified by the rules, thereby allowing us to maintain our workforce and continue to provide services and solutions to our clients. In June 2021, the loan, as well as accrued interest, was forgiven in its entirety by the Small Business Administration.
Our Business Segments
Vaso Corporation (formerly Vasomedical, Inc.) (“Vaso”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 1987. We principally operate in three distinct business segments in the healthcare equipment and information technology industries. We manage and evaluate our operations, and report our financial results, through these three business segments.
·
IT segment, operating through a wholly-owned subsidiary VasoTechnology, Inc., primarily focuses on healthcare IT and managed network technology services;
·
Professional sales service segment, operating through a wholly-owned subsidiary Vaso Diagnostics, Inc. d/b/a VasoHealthcare, primarily focuses on the sale of healthcare capital equipment for General Electric Healthcare (GEHC) into the health provider middle market; and
·
Equipment segment, primarily focuses on the design, manufacture, sale and service of proprietary medical devices and software, operating through a wholly-owned subsidiary VasoMedical, Inc., which in turn operates through Vasomedical Solutions, Inc. for domestic business and Vasomedical Global Corp. for international business, respectively.
VasoTechnology
VasoTechnology, Inc. was formed in May 2015, at the time the Company acquired all of the assets of NetWolves, LLC and its affiliates, including the membership interests in NetWolves Network Services LLC (collectively, “NetWolves”). It currently consists of a managed network and security service division (NetWolves) and a healthcare IT application VAR (value added reseller) division (VasoHealthcare IT). Its current offering includes:
·
Managed diagnostic imaging applications (channel partner of select vendors of healthcare IT products).
·
Managed network infrastructure (routers, switches and other core equipment).
·
Managed network transport (FCC licensed carrier reselling 175+ facility partners).
·
Managed security services.
VasoTechnology uses a combination of proprietary technology, methodology and best-in-class third-party applications to deliver its value proposition.
VasoHealthcare
VasoHealthcare commenced operations in 2010, in conjunction with the Company’s execution of its exclusive sales representation agreement with GEHC, which is the healthcare business division of the General Electric Company (“GE”), to further the sale of certain medical capital equipment in certain domestic market segments. Its current offering consists of:
·
GEHC diagnostic imaging capital equipment.
·
GEHC service agreements for the above equipment.
·
GEHC training services for use of the above equipment.
·
GEHC and third-party financial services for the above equipment.
VasoHealthcare has built a team of over 80 highly experienced sales professionals who utilize highly focused sales management and analytic tools to manage the complete sales process and to increase market penetration.
VasoMedical
The proprietary medical equipment business under VasoMedical traces back to 1995 when the Company began the proprietary Enhanced External Counterpulsation (EECP®) technology in the United States and has since diversified to include other medical hardware and software. Vasomedical Global was formed in 2011 to combine and coordinate the various international operations including design, development, manufacturing, and sales of medical devices and software, while domestic activities are conducted under Vasomedical Solutions. These devices and software primarily consist of cardiovascular diagnostic and therapeutic applications, including:
·
Biox™ series Holter monitors and ambulatory blood pressure recorders.
·
ARCS™ series analysis, reporting and communication software for ECG and blood pressure signals, including cloud-based software and algorithm subscription services.
·
MobiCare® multi-parameter wireless vital-sign monitoring system.
·
EECP® therapy systems for non-invasive, outpatient treatment of ischemic heart disease.
This segment uses its extensive in-house knowledge for cardiovascular devices and software coupled with its engineering resources to cost effectively create and market its proprietary technology. It sells and services its products to customers in the U.S. and China directly and sells and/or services its products in the international market mainly through independent distributors.
Strategic Plan and Objectives
Our short- and long-term plans for the growth of the Company and to increase stockholder value are:
·
Continue to effectively control operating costs.
·
Continue to expand our product and service offerings as well as market penetration in the business of our IT segment.
·
Maintain and improve business performance in our professional sales service segment by increasing market penetration of the GE Healthcare product modalities we represent, and possibly building new teams to represent other vendors.
·
Maintain and grow our equipment business by increasing efficiency and exploring new revenue models.
·
Continue to seek accretive partnership opportunities.
·
Explore options in capital markets for our stock.
Results of Operations - For the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Total revenues increased by $5,729,000, or 8.2%, to $75,579,000 in the year ended December 31, 2021, from $69,850,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020. We reported net income of $6,100,000 and $358,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an improvement of $5,742,000. The increase in net income was primarily due to higher gross profit and the forgiveness of the $3,646,000 PPP loan and interest thereon, partially offset by higher operating costs. Our net income was $0.04 and $0.00 per basic and diluted common share for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Revenues
Revenue in the IT segment was $42,916,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $43,894,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $978,000, or 2.2%, of which $2,046,000 was attributable to a decline in NetWolves revenues, offset by a $1,069,000 increase in VHC-IT revenues.
Commission revenues in the professional sales service segment increased by $6,576,000, or 28.8%, to $29,441,000 in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $22,865,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher volume of GEHC equipment delivered in 2021 coupled with a higher blended commission rate for equipment delivered in 2021. As discussed in Note B to the financial statements, the Company defers recognition of commission revenue until the underlying equipment is delivered. As of December 31, 2021, the Company recorded on its consolidated balance sheet deferred commission revenue of $24,955,000 for this segment (of which $8,465,000 is long-term), an increase of $7,266,000, or 41.1%, compared to $17,689,000 of deferred commission revenue at December 31, 2020 (of which $6,178,000 was long-term). The increase in deferred revenue is due principally to higher total orders booked during the year, partially offset by the increase in equipment deliveries over the same period.
Revenue in our equipment segment increased 4.2% to $3,222,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $3,091,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of a revenue increase in our China operations, partially offset by not including EECP operations in the consolidated financials starting the second quarter of 2020. In April 2020, the Company sold 51% of the equity in its EECP business and does not consolidate these operations after such date. With EECP related revenues all excluded, equipment segment revenue would be $3,102,000 and $2,726,000 for 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $376,000, or 13.8%, mainly a result of higher revenue in our China operations.
Gross Profit
The Company recorded gross profit of $43,133,000, or 57.1% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $38,571,000, or 55.2% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $4,562,000, or 11.8%, was due primarily to a $5,298,000 increase in the professional sales service segment due to higher revenues, partially offset by a $1,008,000 decrease in the IT segment, as a result of lower revenues and lower gross margin.
IT segment gross profit decreased to $16,674,000, or 39% of segment revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $17,682,000, or 40% of segment revenues, in the prior year, a decrease of $1,008,000, of which $972,000 was attributable to NetWolves and $36,000 was attributable to VHC-IT, resulting mainly from lower NW revenues and higher VHC-IT costs.
Professional sales service segment gross profit was $23,906,000, or 81.2% of the segment revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $5,298,000, or 28.5%, from segment gross profit of $18,608,000, or 81.4% of the segment revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in gross profit was due primarily to the increase in the segment revenue as a result of higher equipment delivery volume and higher blended commission rate for year. Cost of commissions increased by $1,278,000, or 30.0%, to $5,535,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to cost of commissions of $4,257,000 in 2020. The increase is due primarily to the increase in the segment revenue as gross profit margin remained little changed year over year. Cost of commissions reflects commission expense associated with certain recognized commission revenues. Commission expense associated with deferred revenue is recorded as deferred commission expense until the related commission revenue is earned.
Equipment segment gross profit increased by $272,000, or 11.9%, to $2,553,000, or 79.2% of equipment segment revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $2,281,000, or 73.8% of equipment segment revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2020, due to higher segment revenue as well as higher gross profit margin as a result of excluding EECP operations from the consolidated financials starting the second quarter of 2020. Excluding EECP operations, gross profit in the equipment segment would be $2,433,000 (78.4% of the segment revenue) and $2,040,000 (74.8% of segment revenue) for 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing an increase for 2021 of $393,000 or 19.3%, year over year. Equipment segment gross profits are dependent on a number of factors including the mix of products sold, their respective models and average selling prices, the ongoing costs of training, maintenance and servicing, as well as certain fixed period costs, including facilities, payroll and insurance.
Operating Income
Operating income was $2,819,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to operating income of $772,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $2,047,000, or 265%. The improvement was primarily attributable to the increase in operating income in the professional sales service segment to $5,918,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $2,977,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, due to higher gross profit, offset by higher operating expenses, and by a $187,000 improvement in the equipment segment, which recorded $32,000 in operating income in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to an operating loss of $155,000 in the prior year, as a result primarily of higher gross profit. Offsetting these increases was a $815,000 increase in operating loss in the IT segment to $2,062,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from an operating loss of $1,247,000 in the prior year resulting mainly from lower gross profit and a one-time write-off in R&D expenses, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses, and a $266,000 increase in corporate expenses to $1,069,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $803,000 in the prior year, mainly due to increases in accounting, audit and legal expenses. .
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $38,593,000, or 51.1% of revenues, and $37,054,000, or 53.0% of revenues, respectively, reflecting an increase of $1,539,000 or 4.2%. The increase in SG&A expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted primarily from a $2,357,000 increase in the professional sales service segment attributable mainly to higher sales personnel-related and travel costs; a $1,103,000 decrease in the IT segment due to lower personnel, marketing and travel costs; a $19,000 increase in the equipment segment due mainly to the deconsolidation of the EECP business starting the second quarter of 2020, and by a $266,000 increase in corporate expenses reflecting higher accounting and director fees.
Research and development (R&D) expenses of $1,721,000, or 2% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $976,000, or 131%, from $745,000, or 1% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily attributable to a one-time write-off of software development costs in our NetWolves operations.
Adjusted EBITDA
We define Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net (loss) income, plus net interest expense (income), tax expense, depreciation and amortization, and non-cash expenses for share-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is a metric that is used by the investment community for comparative and valuation purposes. We disclose this metric in order to support and facilitate the dialogue with research analysts and investors.
Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and when assessing our operating performance, you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation, or as a substitute for net income or other consolidated income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA is set forth below:
Adjusted EBITDA increased by $6,841,000, to $10,423,000 in the year ended December 31, 2021 from $3,582,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to the higher net income, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization, partially offset by lower interest expense, and share-based compensation costs, as compared to the prior year.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, was $3,432,000 and $(415,000), respectively, an increase in net other income of $3,847,000. The increase was due primarily to the gain on forgiveness of PPP loan and interest of $3,646,000 and lower interest expense on our lines of credit and other debt instruments, partially offset by the $110,000 gain on sale of equity in the EECP business in 2020.
Income Tax (Expense) Benefit
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded income tax expense of $151,000, as compared to income tax benefit of $1,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company utilized $4,373,000 and $797,000 in net operating loss carryforwards for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The change to income tax expense in 2021 arose primarily from higher foreign tax expense due to a write-off of deferred tax liability in 2020. The Company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $38 million at December 31, 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and Cash Flow - For the year ended December 31, 2021
We have financed our operations and investment activities primarily from working capital. At December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $6,025,000 and negative working capital of $3,197,000. $12,946,000 in negative working capital at December 31, 2021 is attributable to the net balance of deferred commission expense and deferred revenue. These are non-cash expense and revenue items and have no impact on future cash flows. At March 25, 2022 the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were approximately $11.2 million.
Cash provided by operating activities was $7,815,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021, which consisted of net income after non-cash adjustments of $7,283,000 and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $532,000. The changes in the account balances primarily reflect increases in deferred revenue, accrued expenses, and accrued commissions of $7,260,000, $2,372,000, and $1,497,000, respectively; partially offsetting these changes were increases in accounts and other receivables and deferred commission expenses of $6,052,000 and $1,195,000, respectively, and a decrease in accounts payable of $3,492,000.
Cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $260,000 consisting of $415,000 in purchases of equipment and software offset by $155,000 in redemption of short-term investment.
Cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $8,329,000, primarily attributable to repayment of $5,448,000 on our lines of credit and $2,881,000 in payments of notes and finance leases.
Liquidity
The Company expects to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy its obligations for the next twelve months. It is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact our operations depending on the duration of the pandemic and the timing and success of the reopening of the economy.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities (SPES), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of December 31, 2021, we are not involved in any unconsolidated SPES or other off-balance sheet arrangements.
Effects of Inflation
We believe that inflation and changing prices over the past two years have not had a significant impact on our revenue or on our results of operations.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Note B of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includes a summary of our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. The application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policy and estimate is as follows:
Allowance for Commission Adjustments
In our professional sale service segment, we bill a portion of commissions on the orders we booked in advance of delivery of the underlying equipment. Such amounts are classified in our consolidated balance sheets in accounts receivable and deferred revenue, net of estimated commission adjustments. Similarly, commissions payable to our sales force related to such billings are recorded as deferred commission expense, net of the impact of the estimated commission adjustments, when the associated deferred revenue is recorded. The commission adjustments are based on estimates of future order cancellations, which is calculated based on historical cancellation rates and applicable credit policies.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Note B of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includes a description of the Company’s evaluation of recently issued accounting pronouncements.
