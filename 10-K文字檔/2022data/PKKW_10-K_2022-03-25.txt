Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Operations
Overview
Management’s Discussion and Analysis is provided to assist in the understanding and evaluation of Parkway Acquisition Corp’s. financial condition and its results of operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Parkway Acquisition Corp. (“Parkway” or the “Company”) was incorporated as a Virginia corporation on November 2, 2015. Parkway was formed as a business combination shell company for the purpose of completing a business combination transaction between Grayson Bankshares, Inc. (“Grayson”) and Cardinal Bankshares Corporation (“Cardinal”). On November 6, 2015, Grayson, Cardinal and Parkway entered into an agreement pursuant to which Grayson and Cardinal merged with and into Parkway, with Parkway as the surviving corporation (the “Cardinal merger”). The merger agreement established exchange ratios under which each share of Grayson common stock was converted to the right to receive 1.76 shares of common stock of Parkway, while each share of Cardinal common stock was converted to the right to receive 1.30 shares of common stock of Parkway. The exchange ratios resulted in Grayson shareholders receiving approximately 60% of the newly issued Parkway shares and Cardinal shareholders receiving approximately 40% of the newly issued Parkway shares. The Cardinal merger was completed on July 1, 2016. Grayson was considered the acquiror and Cardinal was considered the acquiree in the transaction for accounting purposes. Upon completion of the Cardinal merger, the Bank of Floyd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cardinal, was merged with and into Grayson National Bank (the “Bank’), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Grayson. Effective March 13, 2017, the Bank changed its name to Skyline National Bank.
On March 1, 2018, Parkway entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Parkway acquired Great State Bank (“Great State”), based in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. The agreement provided for the merger of Great State with and into the Bank, with the Bank as the surviving bank (the “Great State merger”). The transaction closed and the merger became effective on July 1, 2018. Each share of Great State common stock was converted into the right to receive 1.21 shares of Parkway common stock. The Company issued 1,191,899 shares and recognized $15.5 million in surplus in the Great State merger. Parkway was considered the acquiror and Great State was considered the acquiree in the transaction for accounting purposes.
The Bank was organized under the laws of the United States in 1900 and now serves the Virginia counties of Grayson, Floyd, Carroll, Wythe, Montgomery and Roanoke, and the North Carolina counties of Alleghany, Ashe, Burke, Caldwell, Catawba, Cleveland, Davie, Watauga, Wilkes, and Yadkin, and the surrounding areas, through twenty-five full-service banking offices. As a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured national banking association, the Bank is subject to regulation by the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC. Parkway is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
For purposes of this annual report, all information contained herein as of and for periods prior to July 1, 2018 reflects the operations of Parkway prior to the Great State merger. Unless this report otherwise indicates or the context otherwise requires, all references to “Parkway” or the “Company” as of and for periods subsequent to July 1, 2018 refer to the combined company and its subsidiary as a combined entity after the Great State merger, and all references to “Parkway” or the “Company” as of and for periods prior to July 1, 2018 are references to Parkway and its subsidiary as a combined entity prior to the merger.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Parkway had net earnings of $9.5 million for 2021 compared to $5.9 million for 2020. Our strong financial performance in 2021 can be attributed in part to our team’s efforts in the SBA-PPP loan program and solid growth in the bank’s core loan portfolio as well. From its commencement in 2020 through 2021 we originated over $125 million in SBA-PPP loans providing critical funding to businesses throughout our market area and in 2021 we grew our core loans (excluding SBA-PPP balances) at an annualized rate of over 7%. Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2021 represented a return on average assets of 1.01% and a return on average equity of 10.98%, compared to 0.75% and 7.06%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The net interest margin was 3.74% in 2021, compared to 3.96% in 2020. The net interest margin continued to decline during 2021 due to historically low interest rates and increasingly competitive loan pricing. As we look to 2022, we expect continued pressure on our net interest margin as the SBA-PPP program winds down and the Federal Reserve maintains its accommodative monetary policy. Increases in the federal funds rate however, could have a positive impact on margins as the year 2022 progresses.
Forward Looking Statements
From time to time, the Company and its senior managers have made and will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

the Company’s success at managing the risks involved in the foregoing.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Critical Accounting Policies
The Company’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2021 contain a summary of its significant accounting policies. Management believes the Company’s policies with respect to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses, and asset impairment judgments, such as the recoverability of intangible assets and other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities, involve a higher degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments that often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. Accordingly, management considers the policies related to those areas as critical.
The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting: the first of which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable, and the second, which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral, present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market, and the loan balance.
The allowance for loan losses has three basic components: (i) the formula allowance, (ii) the specific allowance, and (iii) the unallocated allowance. Each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur. The formula allowance uses a historical loss view as an indicator of future losses and, as a result, could differ from the loss incurred in the future. However, since this history is updated with the most recent loss information, the errors that might otherwise occur are mitigated. The specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss. Historical loss information, expected cash flows and fair market value of collateral are used to estimate these losses. The use of these techniques is inherently subjective and our actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates. The unallocated allowance captures losses that are attributable to various economic events, industry or geographic sectors whose impact on the portfolio have occurred but have yet to be recognized in either the formula or specific allowance.

Table 2. Rate/Volume Variance Analysis (dollars in thousands)
(1)
The variance in interest attributed to both volume and rate has been allocated to variance attributed to volume and variance attributed to rate in proportion to the absolute value of the change in each.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income, the principal source of the Company's earnings, is the amount of income generated by earning assets (primarily loans and investment securities) less the interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities (primarily deposits used to fund earning assets). Table 1 summarizes the major components of net interest income for the past three years and also provides yields and average balances.
For the year ended December 31, 2021 total interest income increased by $3.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in interest income in 2021 was primarily due to organic loan growth in new and existing markets and the $3.8 million recognized in SBA-PPP related fees during 2021; however, yields were negatively impacted by the exceptionally low interest rate environment as well as continual competitive pressure on loan rates. As a result, interest income on loans increased by $2.3 million in 2021 compared to $1.6 million in 2020. Accretion of purchased loan discounts increased interest income by $940 thousand in 2021 compared to $1.2 million in 2020, representing a decrease of $259 thousand. The increases in interest income on investment securities was due to the $63.0 million increase in average investment securities due to investment purchases during 2021. The decrease in interest income on federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits in banks were due to the impact of lower short term interest rates. Interest expense on deposits decreased by $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period last year, reflecting rate reductions in deposit offerings, despite the $89.8 million increase in average interest-bearing deposits from 2020 to 2021. A significant portion of the growth in interest-bearing deposits year-over-year is attributed to increased balances held by customers during the pandemic and government stimulus programs, new relationships developed from the SBA-PPP program, as well as organic growth in new and existing markets during 2021.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Amortization of premiums on acquired time deposits, which reduces interest expense, totaled $108 thousand in 2021, compared to $189 thousand in 2020, representing a decrease of $81 thousand. The effects of changes in volumes and rates on net interest income in 2021 compared to 2020, and 2020 compared to 2019 are shown in Table 2.
The aforementioned factors led to an increase in net interest income of $4.0 million or 14.21% for 2021 as compared to 2020. The net yield on interest-earning assets decreased by 22 basis points to 3.74% in 2021 compared to 3.96% in 2020.
Provision for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses is established to provide for expected losses in the Company’s loan portfolio. Management determines the provision for credit losses required to maintain an allowance adequate to provide for probable losses. Some of the factors considered in making this decision are the levels and collectability of past due loans, volume of new loans, composition of the loan portfolio, and general economic outlook.
The provision for loan losses was $723 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in loan loss provisions from 2020 to 2021 despite the overall growth in the loan portfolio was due to the improvement in credit quality on the loan portfolio and the reduction of past due loans and nonperforming loans from 2020 to 2021, as well as net recoveries of $54 thousand in 2021 compared to net charge offs of $182 thousand in 2020.
The allowance for loan losses for SBA-PPP loans remaining at December 31, 2021 were separately evaluated given the explicit government guarantee. This analysis, which incorporated historical experience with similar SBA guarantees and underwriting, concluded the likelihood of loss was remote and therefore these loans were assigned a zero expected credit loss in the allowance for loan losses.
The reserve for loan losses at December 31, 2021 was approximately 0.83% of total loans, compared to 0.74% at December 31, 2020. Management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the acquired Great State and Cardinal loan portfolios was reflected as a purchase discount which will continue to be accreted into income over the remaining life of the acquired loans. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the remaining unaccreted discount on the acquired loan portfolios totaled $1.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively. Management believes the provision and the resulting allowance for loan losses are adequate. Additional information is contained in Tables 12 and 13, and is discussed in Nonperforming and Problem Assets.
Other Income
Noninterest income increased by $1.3 million in 2021 compared to 2020. Mortgage origination fees increased by $341 thousand in 2021 compared to 2020. The mortgage department closed approximately $57.0 million of mortgage loans for the secondary market during 2021 compared to $43.5 million in 2020. Gains from sales of available-for-sale securities totaled $265 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $315 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020. ATM, credit and debit card income increased by $460 thousand from 2020 to 2021 due to increased debit card usage. Other income increased by $392 thousand from 2020 to 2021 due to the recognition of a one-time lease termination fee of $200 thousand and the recognition of a one-time $193 thousand incentive bonus on a contract renegotiation with a service provider.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Table 3. Sources of Noninterest Income (dollars in thousands)
Other Expense
The major components of noninterest expense for the past two years are illustrated in Table 4.
Total noninterest expenses increased by $1.2 million, or 4.66% for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to employee and branch costs associated with branch expansion into new North Carolina markets. Salary and benefit cost increased by $77 thousand from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased by $378 thousand and data processing expenses increased by $261 thousand from 2020 to 2021, due to the branch expansion. FDIC/OCC assessments increased by $226 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the deposit growth experience during 2021. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in amortization of core deposit intangibles of $116 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to same period in 2020. Professional fees increased by $177 thousand primarily due to increased fees paid for accounting and consulting services. Other expenses increased by $147 thousand in the year over year comparison, which includes a $44 thousand prepayment fee incurred on the paydown of $5.0 million in FHLB advances in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Table 4. Sources of Noninterest Expense (dollars in thousands)
The overhead efficiency ratio of noninterest expense to adjusted total revenue (net interest income plus noninterest income) was 67.53% in 2021 and 74.69% in 2020.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense is based on amounts reported in the statements of income (after adjustments for non-taxable income and non-deductible expenses) and consists of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes on temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future Federal income tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled.
Income tax expense (substantially all Federal) was $2.4 million in 2021 and $1.4 million in 2020, resulting in effective tax rates of 20.4% and 19.8%, respectively. The increase in income tax expense of $978 thousand in 2021 was primarily due to the increase in income before taxes of $4.6 million in 2021 compared to 2020.
Net deferred tax assets of $1.1 million, and $1.0 million existed at December 31, 2021 and 2020 respectively. At December 31, 2021, net deferred tax assets included $392 thousand of deferred tax assets applicable to unrealized losses on investment securities available for sale, and $176 thousand of deferred tax assets applicable to unfunded projected pension benefit obligations. Accordingly, these amounts were not charged to income but recorded directly to the related stockholders’ equity account.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Analysis of Financial Condition
Average earning assets increased 21.15% from 2020 to 2021 due to asset growth primarily reflected in increased loans and investment securities, and higher liquid asset balances due to average deposit growth of $154.6 million. Total earning assets represented 92.08% of total average assets in 2021 and 91.02% in 2020. The mix of average earning assets changed from 2020 to 2021 as average loans increased by $52.8 million, or 8.32%, and average investment securities increased by $63.0 million, or 191.18%. Average federal funds sold and average deposits in banks increased by $35.2 million, or 75.86%, from 2020 to 2021.
Table 5. Average Asset Mix (dollars in thousands)
Average loans for 2021 represented 73.18% of total average assets compared to 80.91% in 2020. Average federal funds sold increased from 0.08% to 3.97% of total average assets while deposits in other banks decreased from 5.83% to 4.71% of total average assets over the same time period. Average investment securities increased from 4.20% in 2020 to 10.22% of total average assets in 2021. The balances of nonearning assets to total average assets decreased from 8.98% to 7.92%.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Loans
Average loans totaled $687.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This represents an increase of 8.32% from the average of $634.8 million for 2020. The increase was primarily due to organic growth in new and existing markets during as well as continued participation in SBA-PPP lending during 2021.
The loan portfolio consists primarily of real estate and commercial loans, including SBA-PPP loans. These loans accounted for 96.31% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2021. This is down from the 96.97% that the two categories maintained at December 31, 2020. The amount of loans outstanding by type at December 31, 2021 and 2020 and the maturity distribution for variable and fixed rate loans as of December 31, 2021 are presented in Tables 6 and 7, respectively.
Table 6. Loan Portfolio Summary (dollars in thousands)
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Table 7. Maturity Schedule of Loans, as of December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands)
Interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk, maturity and amount of the loan. Competitive pressures, money market rates, availability of funds, and government regulations also influence interest rates. On average, loans yielded 4.81% in 2021 compared to an average yield of 4.85% in 2020. The decrease in loan yields was due to increasing competition in our markets for loans, in addition to a generally lower interest rate environment and the low rate on SBA-PPP loans, which was partially offset by the fee income earned on the SBA-PPP loans, as well as a reduction in the overall impact of purchase accounting adjustment as the accretion of purchase loan discounts decreased by $259 thousand during 2021.
Investment Securities
The Company uses its investment portfolio to provide liquidity for unexpected deposit decreases or loan generation, to meet the Bank’s interest rate sensitivity goals, and to generate income.
Management of the investment portfolio has always been conservative with the majority of investments taking the form of purchases of U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government Agencies, U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises and State and Municipal bonds, as well as investment grade corporate bond issues. Management views the investment portfolio as a source of income, and purchases securities with the intent of retaining them until maturity. However, adjustments are necessary in the portfolio to provide an adequate source of liquidity which can be used to meet funding requirements for loan demand and deposit fluctuations and to control interest rate risk. Therefore, from time to time, management may sell certain securities prior to their maturity. Table 8 presents the investment portfolio at the end of 2021 by major types of investments and contractual maturity ranges. Investment securities in Table 8 may have repricing or call options that are earlier than the contractual maturity date.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The total amortized cost of investment securities increased by approximately $98.8 million from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, while the average balance of investment securities carried throughout the year increased by approximately $63.0 million from 2020 to 2021. The average yield of the investment portfolio decreased to 1.60% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2.30% for 2020.
Table 8. Investment Securities - Maturity/Yield Schedule (dollars in thousands)
(1)
Weighted average yields on investment securities are based on amortized cost and are calculated on a tax equivalent basis.
Deposits
The Company relies on deposits generated in its market area to provide the majority of funds needed to support lending activities and for investments in liquid assets. More specifically, core deposits (total deposits less certificates of deposit in denominations of more than $250,000) are the primary funding source. The Company’s balance sheet growth is largely determined by the availability of deposits in its markets, the cost of attracting the deposits, and the prospects of profitably utilizing the available deposits by increasing the loan or investment portfolios. The Company’s management must continuously monitor market pricing, competitor’s rates, and the internal interest rate spreads to maintain the Company’s growth and profitability. The Company attempts to structure rates so as to promote deposit and asset growth while at the same time increasing overall profitability of the Company.
Average total deposits for the year ended December 31, 2021 amounted to $839.1 million, which was an increase of $154.6 million, or 22.59% from 2020. A significant portion of the increase is attributed to increased balances held by customers during the pandemic, new relationships developed from the SBA-PPP program, as well as organic growth in new and existing markets. Average core deposits totaled $801.0 million in 2021 representing a 23.41% increase over the $649.0 million in 2020. The percentage of the Company’s average deposits that are interest-bearing decreased to 67.4% in 2021 compared to 69.5% in 2020. This decrease is due to the average demand deposits, which earn no interest, increasing 31.10% from $208.5 million in 2020 to $273.4 million in 2021. Average deposits for the periods ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are summarized in Table 9.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Table 9. Deposit Mix (dollars in thousands)
The average balance of certificates of deposit issued in denominations of more than $250,000 increased by $2.7 million, or 7.50%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. The strategy of management has been to support loan and investment growth with core deposits and not to aggressively solicit the more volatile, large denomination certificates of deposit. Loan and investment securities growth in 2021 was primarily funded through core deposit growth, thus reducing management’s reliance on large denomination certificates of deposit for funding purposes.
Estimated uninsured deposits totaled $279.3 million at December 31, 2021. Uninsured amounts are estimated based on the portion of account balance in excess of FDIC insurance limits. Table 10 provides maturity information relating to uninsured time deposits at December 31, 2021.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Equity
Stockholders’ equity totaled $85.2 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $85.1 million at December 31, 2020. The increase of $88 thousand was due to earnings of $9.5 million, plus share-based compensation of $155 thousand, less other comprehensive losses of $1.6 million, less common stock repurchases of $6.3 million, and the payment of dividends of $1.6 million. Book value increased from $14.08 per share at December 31, 2020 to $15.20 per share at December 31, 2021.
Effective January 1, 2015, the federal banking regulators adopted rules to implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rules required the Bank to comply with the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% of risk-weighted assets; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% of risk-weighted assets; and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4% of total assets. As fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the rules require the Bank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% “capital conservation buffer” (which is added to the 4.5% common equity Tier 1 ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%), (iii) a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%), and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets.
Under Basel III Capital requirements, a capital conservation buffer of 0.625% became effective beginning on January 1, 2016. The capital conservation buffer was gradually increased through January 1, 2019 to 2.50%. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banks are now required to maintain levels that meet the required minimum plus the capital conservation buffer in order to make distributions, such as dividends, or discretionary bonus payments. The Banks’s capital conservation buffer is 4.23% as of December 31, 2021.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Nonperforming and Problem Assets
Certain credit risks are inherent in making loans, particularly commercial and consumer loans. Management prudently assesses these risks and attempts to manage them effectively. The Bank attempts to use shorter-term loans and, although a portion of the loans have been made based upon the value of collateral, the underwriting decision is generally based on the cash flow of the borrower as the source of repayment rather than the value of the collateral. The Bank also attempts to reduce repayment risk by adhering to internal credit policies and procedures. These policies and procedures include officer and customer limits, periodic loan documentation review and follow up on exceptions to credit policies.
Table 12 provides information about the allowance for loan losses, nonperforming assets and loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Table 12. Loan Loss Data (dollars in thousands)
Total nonperforming loans were 0.67% and 1.32% of total outstanding loans as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The majority of the decrease in nonaccrual loans from 2021 to 2020 came in the “farmland” category as a result of one large credit returning to accrual status in 2021. Nonaccrual loans in this category decreased by $3.8 million. Loans are placed in nonaccrual status when, in management’s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Loans are removed from nonaccrual status when they are deemed a loss and charged to the allowance, transferred to foreclosed assets, or returned to accrual status based upon performance consistent with the original terms of the loan or a subsequent restructuring thereof. Management’s ability to ultimately resolve these loans either with or without significant loss will be determined, to a great extent, by general economic and real estate market conditions.
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, interest income recognized on loans in nonaccrual status was approximately $39 thousand and $46 thousand, respectively. Had these credits been current in accordance with their original terms, the gross interest income for these credits would have been approximately $104 thousand and $210 thousand, respectively for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Restructured loans represent troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) that have returned to accrual status after a period of performance in accordance with their modified terms. The decrease in restructured loans from 2020 to 2021 came primarily in the form of principal reductions. A TDR is considered to be successful if the borrower maintains adequate payment performance under the modified terms and is financially stable.
There were no foreclosed assets in 2021 or 2020. More information on nonperforming assets and loan modifications in response to COVID-19 can be found in Note 5 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” found in the company’s 2021 Annual Report.

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020 we had loans with a current principal balance of $10.9 million and $15.1 million rated “Watch” or “Special Mention”. The “Watch” classification is utilized by us when we have an initial concern about the financial health of a borrower that indicate above average risk. We then gather current financial information about the borrower and evaluate our current risk in the credit. After this review we will either move the loan to a higher risk rating category or move it back to its original risk rating. Loans may be left rated “Watch” for a longer period of time if, in management’s opinion, there are risks that cannot be fully evaluated without the passage of time, and we want to review it on a more regular basis. Assets that do not currently expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant a classification such as “Substandard” or “Doubtful” but otherwise possess weaknesses are designated “Special Mention”. Loans rated as “Watch” or “Special Mention” are not considered “potential problem loans” until they are determined by management to be classified as “Substandard”. As of December 31, 2021, potential problem loans classified as substandard totaled $6.0 million compared to $11.9 million at December 31, 2020. Past due loans are often regarded as a precursor to further credit problems which would lead to future increases in nonaccrual loans or other real estate owned. As of December 31, 2021 loans past due 30-89 days and still accruing totaled $346 thousand compared to $622 thousand at December 31, 2020.
Certain types of loans, such as option ARM products, subprime loans and loans with initial teaser rates, can have a greater risk of non-collection than other loans. The Bank has not offered these types of loans in the past and does not offer them currently. Junior-lien mortgages can also be considered higher risk loans. Our junior-lien portfolio at December 31, 2021 totaled $3.8 million, or 0.55% of total loans. The charge-off rates in this category do not vary significantly from other real estate secured loans in the current year.
The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb potential losses. Some of the factors which management considers in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses are: past loss experience, an evaluation of the current loan portfolio, identified loan problems, the loan volume outstanding, the present and expected economic conditions in general, and in particular, how such conditions relate to the market area that the Bank serves. Bank regulators also periodically review the Bank’s loans and other assets to assess their quality. Loans deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance. Provisions for loan losses and recoveries on loans previously charged off are added to the allowance. The reserve for loan losses at December 31, 2021 was approximately 0.83% of total loans, compared to 0.74% at December 31, 2020. Management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the acquired Cardinal Bankshares Corporation and Great State loan portfolios was reflected as a purchase discount which will continue to be accreted into income over the remaining life of the acquired loans. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the remaining unaccreted discount on the acquired loan portfolios totaled $1.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively. This remaining discount can be used for credit losses if a loss occurs on individual loans in the purchased portfolios.
To quantify the specific elements of the allowance for loan losses, the Bank begins by establishing a specific reserve for larger-balance, non-homogeneous loans, which have been identified as being impaired. This reserve is determined by comparing the principal balance of the loan with the net present value of the future anticipated cash flows or the fair market value of the related collateral. If the impaired loan is collateral dependent, then any excess in the recorded investment in the loan over the fair value of the collateral that is identified as uncollectible in the near term is charged off against the allowance for loan losses at that time. The bank also collectively evaluates for impairment smaller-balance TDRs. The specific component of the allowance for smaller-balance TDR loans is calculated on a pooled basis considering historical experience adjusted for qualitative factors. The bank then reviews certain loans in the portfolio and assigns grades to loans which have been reviewed. Loans which are adversely classified are given a specific allowance based on the historical loss experience of similar type loans in each adverse grade with further adjustments for external factors. The remaining portfolio is segregated into loan pools consistent with regulatory guidelines. An allocation is then made to the reserve for these loan pools based on the bank’s historical loss experience with further adjustments for external factors. The allowance is allocated according to the amount deemed to be reasonably necessary to provide for the possibility of losses being incurred within the respective categories of loans, although the entire allowance is available to absorb any actual charge-offs that may occur.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk
The Bank is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.
The Bank’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as for on-balance sheet instruments. A summary of the Bank’s commitments at December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the party. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, residential real estate and income-producing commercial properties.
Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Collateral held varies as specified above and is required in instances which the Bank deems necessary.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk
The principal goals of the Bank’s asset and liability management strategy are the maintenance of adequate liquidity and the management of interest rate risk. Liquidity is the ability to convert assets to cash to fund depositors’ withdrawals or borrowers’ loans without significant loss. Interest rate risk management balances the effects of interest rate changes on assets that earn interest or liabilities on which interest is paid, to protect the Bank from wide fluctuations in its net interest income which could result from interest rate changes.
Management must insure that adequate funds are available at all times to meet the needs of its customers. On the asset side of the balance sheet, maturing investments, loan payments, maturing loans, federal funds sold, and unpledged investment securities are principal sources of liquidity. On the liability side of the balance sheet, liquidity sources include core deposits, the ability to increase large denomination certificates, federal fund lines from correspondent banks, borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank, as well as the ability to generate funds through the issuance of long-term debt and equity.
The liquidity ratio (the level of liquid assets divided by total deposits plus short-term liabilities) was 23.1% at December 31, 2021 compared to 15.0% at December 31, 2020. These ratios are considered to be adequate by management.
The Bank uses cash and federal funds sold to meet its daily funding needs. If funding needs are met through holdings of excess cash and federal funds, then profits might be sacrificed as higher-yielding investments are foregone in the interest of liquidity. Therefore management determines, based on such items as loan demand and deposit activity, an appropriate level of cash and federal funds and seeks to maintain that level.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The primary goals of the investment portfolio are liquidity management and maturity gap management. As investment securities mature the proceeds are reinvested in federal funds sold if the federal funds level needs to be increased, otherwise the proceeds are reinvested in similar investment securities. The majority of investment security transactions consist of replacing securities that have been called or matured. The Bank keeps a portion of its investment portfolio in unpledged assets that are less than 60 months to maturity or next repricing date. These investments are a preferred source of funds in that they can be disposed of in most interest rate environments without causing significant damage to that quarter’s profits.
Interest rate risk is the effect that changes in interest rates would have on interest income and interest expense as interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities either reprice or mature. Management attempts to maintain the portfolios of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities with maturities or repricing opportunities at levels that will afford protection from erosion of net interest margin, to the extent practical, from changes in interest rates. Table 15 shows the sensitivity of the Bank’s balance sheet on December 31, 2021. This table reflects the sensitivity of the balance sheet as of that specific date and is not necessarily indicative of the position on other dates. At December 31, 2021 the Bank appeared to be cumulatively asset-sensitive (interest-earning assets subject to interest rate changes exceeding interest-bearing liabilities subject to changes in interest rates). However, in the one year window liabilities subject to changes in interest rates exceed assets subject to interest rate changes (non asset-sensitive).
Matching sensitive positions alone does not ensure the Bank has no interest rate risk. The repricing characteristics of assets are different from the repricing characteristics of funding sources. Thus, net interest income can be impacted by changes in interest rates even if the repricing opportunities of assets and liabilities are perfectly matched.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The Company uses a number of tools to monitor its interest rate risk, including simulating net interest income under various scenarios, monitoring the present value change in equity under the same scenarios, and monitoring the difference or gap between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities over various time periods (as displayed in Table 15).
The earnings simulation model forecasts annual net income under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates, changes in the shape of the yield curve, and changes in interest rate relationships. Management evaluates the effect on net interest income and present value equity from gradual changes in rates of up to 400 basis points up or down over a 12-month period. Table 16 presents the Bank’s twelve-month forecasts for changes in net interest income and market value of equity resulting from changes in rates of up to 300 basis points up or down, as of December 31, 2021.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
The consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this document have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all Company assets and liabilities are monetary in nature, therefore the impact of inflation is reflected primarily in the increased cost of operations. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.
