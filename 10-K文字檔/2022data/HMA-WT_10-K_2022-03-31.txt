Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Overview
We are a newly formed blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation on February 10, 2021 and created for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We have not selected any business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, had any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our capital stock in connection with our initial business combination, shares of our capital stock issued to owners of the target, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.
The issuance of additional shares of our stock in connection with our initial business combination:
•
may significantly dilute the equity interest of our existing investors, which dilution would increase if the anti-dilution provisions in the founder shares resulted in the issuance of shares of Class A common stock on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the founder shares;
•
may subordinate the rights of holders of our common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our common stock;
•
could cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock is issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors;
•
may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us;
•
may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our units, Class A common stock and/or warrants; and
•
may not result in adjustment to the exercise price of our warrants.
Similarly, if we issue debt securities or otherwise incur significant indebtedness, it could result in:
•
default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;
•
acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;
•
our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt is payable on demand;
•
our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt is outstanding;
•
our inability to pay dividends on our common stock;
•
using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our common stock if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;
•
limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;
•
increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and
•
limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.
Results of Operations
Our entire activity since inception through December 31, 2021 related to our formation and IPO. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a Business Combination. We expect to generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held after our IPO. We expect that we will incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with searching for, and completing, a Business Combination.
For the period from February 10, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, we had a net loss of $14,010, which consisted of solely formation and operating costs.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had $25,722 in our operating bank account, and working capital deficit of $695,249 (excluding deferred offering costs). Our liquidity needs up to December 31, 2021 had been satisfied through a payment from the sponsor of $25,000 for the founder shares.
Subsequent to the annual period covered by this Annual Report, we consummated the IPO and private placement. Of the net proceeds from the sale of the units and private placement warrants, $197,281,043 of cash was placed in the trust account and $1,567,447 of cash was held outside of the trust account and is available for our working capital purposes.
In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, the sponsor or an affiliate of the sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us working capital loans. As of December 31, 2021, there were no amounts outstanding under any working capital loans.
Based on the foregoing, management believes that we have alleviated the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and has sufficient working capital and borrowing capacity to meet our needs through the earlier of the consummation of a business combination or one year from this filing. Over this time period, we will be using these funds to pay existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial business combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the business combination.
Related Party Transactions
Founder Shares
On March 4, 2021, the sponsor purchased 7,187,500 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. On October 27, 2021, the sponsor surrendered 1,437,500 founder shares for no consideration, resulting in 5,750,000 shares outstanding of which 750,000 were subject to forfeiture in the event the underwriters’ over-allotment option was not exercised. On January 14, 2022, the sponsor surrendered 718,750 founder shares for no consideration, resulting in 5,031,250 shares outstanding of which 656,250 were subject to forfeiture in the event the underwriters’ over-allotment option was not exercised. Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000 by our sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The number of founder shares issued was based on the expectation that the founder shares represent 20% of the outstanding shares after the IPO. Up to 656,250 founder shares were subject to forfeiture by the sponsor depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option was exercised. As a result of the underwriters’ election to partially exercise their over-allotment option on February 3, 2022, 436,732 shares of Class B common stock are no longer subject to forfeiture.
The initial stockholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares until the earlier to occur of: (A) one year after the completion of the initial business combination; or (B) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction after the initial business combination that results in all of the stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property. Any permitted transferees would be subject to the same restrictions and other agreements of the initial stockholders with respect to any founder shares (the “Lock-up”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the initial business combination, the founder shares will be released from the Lock-up.
Promissory Note-Related Party
Our sponsor agreed to loan us up to $300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of the IPO. The loan was non-interest bearing, unsecured and due at the earlier of June 30, 2022 or the closing of the IPO.
As of December 31, 2021, $86,414 was outstanding under the promissory note. The loan was repaid in full upon the closing of the IPO out of the offering proceeds that had been allocated to the payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions). We overpaid $16,055, which will be returned by the sponsor immediately.
Related Party Loans
In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, the sponsor or an affiliate of the sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required (the “Working Capital Loans”). If we complete the initial business combination, we may repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans may be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to the Sponsor. At December 31, 2021, no such Working Capital Loans were outstanding.
Administrative Support Agreement
We pay an affiliate of the sponsor a total of $20,000 per month for office space, administrative and support services. Upon completion of the initial business combination or the liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.
Off-balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“US GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. In accordance with US GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Our significant accounting policies are fully described in Note 2 to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, and we believe those accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”), which simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. The ASU also removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity-linked contracts to qualify for scope exception, and it simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. We continue to evaluate the impact of ASU 2020-06 on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements.
JOBS Act
On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We will qualify as an "emerging growth company" and under the JOBS Act will be allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.
Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an "emerging growth company", we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things: (1) provide an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (2) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; (3) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis); and (4) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer's compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our IPO or until we are no longer an "emerging growth company," whichever is earlier.
