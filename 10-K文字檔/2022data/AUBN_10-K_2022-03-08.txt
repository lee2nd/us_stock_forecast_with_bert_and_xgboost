OPERATIONS
The following is a discussion of our financial condition at December 31,
2021 and 2020 and our results of operations for
the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The purpose of this discussion is to provide
information about our financial
condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from the
consolidated financial statements. The
following discussion and analysis should be read along with our consolidated
financial statements and the related notes
included elsewhere herein. In addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking
statements, so you should
refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and “Special Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”.
OVERVIEW
The Company was incorporated in 1990 under the laws of the State of Delaware and became a bank
holding company after
it acquired its Alabama predecessor,
which was a bank holding company established in 1984. The Bank, the Company's
principal subsidiary, is an Alabama
state-chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System and has operated
continuously since 1907. Both the Company and the Bank are headquartered
in Auburn, Alabama. The Bank conducts its
business primarily in East Alabama, including Lee County and surrounding areas.
The Bank operates full-service branches
in Auburn, Opelika, Notasulga and Valley,
Alabama.
The Bank also operates loan production offices in Auburn and
Phenix City, Alabama.

Financial Summary
The Company’s net earnings were $8.0
million for the full year 2021, compared to $7.5 million for the full year 2020.
Basic and diluted net earnings per share were $2.27 per share for the full year 2021,
compared to $2.09 per share for the full
year 2020.
Net interest income (tax-equivalent) was $24.5
million in 2021, a 1% decrease compared to $24.8 million in 2020. This
decrease was primarily due to net interest margin compression
,
partially offset by balance sheet growth.
Net interest
margin (tax-equivalent) decreased to 2.55% in 2021,
compared to 2.92% in 2020, primarily due to the lower interest rate
environment and changes in our asset mix resulting from the significant increase
in deposits from government stimulus and
relief programs and customers’ increased savings.
At December 31, 2021, the Company’s allowance
for loan losses was $4.9 million, or 1.08% of total loans, compared to
$5.6 million, or 1.22%
of total loans, at December 31, 2020.
Excluding
Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans, which
are guaranteed by the SBA,
the Company’s allowance for loan losses
was 1.10% and 1.27% of total loans at December 31,
2021 and 2020, respectively
.
The Company recorded a negative provision for loan losses of $0.6
million in 2021 compared
to a charge of $1.1 million during 2020.
The negative provision for loan losses was primarily related to improvements in
economic conditions in our primary market area, and related improvements in our
asset quality.
The provision for loan
losses is based upon various estimates and judgements, including the absolute level
of loans, loan growth, credit quality and
the amount of net charge-offs.
Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans were 0.02% in 2021
,
compared to net
recoveries as a percent of average loans of 0.03% in 2020.
Noninterest income was $4.3 million in 2021 compared to $5.4
million in 2020.
The decrease was primarily due to a $0.8
million decrease in mortgage lending income in 2021 as refinance activity declined
in our primary market area and a $0.3
million non-taxable death benefit from bank-owned life insurance received
in 2020.
Noninterest expense was $19.4
million in 2021 compared to $19.6
million in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a
reduction of $0.8
million in various expenses related to the redevelopment of the Company’s
headquarters in downtown
Auburn.
This decrease was mostly offset by increases in salaries and benefits expe
nse of $0.4 million and a $0.2 million
increase in FDIC and other regulatory assessments during 2021.
Income tax expense was $1.4
million in 2021 and $1.6 million in 2020 reflecting an effective tax rate of 14.89
%
and
17.72%, respectively.
This decrease was primarily due to an income tax benefit related to a New Markets Tax
Credit
investment funded in the fourth quarter of 2021.
The Company’s effective income
tax rate is principally impacted by tax-
exempt earnings from the Company’s investments
in municipal securities, bank-owned life insurance, and New Markets
Tax Credits.
The Company paid cash dividends of $1.04
per share in 2021, an increase of 2% from 2020. At December 31, 2021, the
Bank’s regulatory capital ratios
were well above the minimum amounts required to be “well capitalized” under current
regulatory standards with a total risk-based capital ratio of 17.06%,
a tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.35% and common equity tier
1 (“CET1”) of 16.23% at December 31, 2021.
COVID-19 Impact Assessment
The COVID-19 pandemic has occurred in waves of different
variants since the first quarter of 2020.
Vaccines
to protect
against and/or reduce the severity of COVID-19 were widely introduced at the beginning
of 2021.
At times, the pandemic
has severely restricted the level of economic activity in our markets. In response to the COVID
-19 pandemic, the State of
Alabama, and most other states, have taken preventative or protective actions to prevent the
spread of the virus, including
imposing restrictions on travel and business operations and a statewide mask mandate,
advising or requiring individuals to
limit or forego their time outside of their homes, limitations on gathering of people and social distancing,
and causing
temporary closures of businesses that have been deemed to be non-essential. Though certain
of these measures have been
relaxed or eliminated, especially as vaccination levels increased, such
measures could be reestablished in cases of new
waves, especially a wave of a COVID-19 variant that is more resistant
to existing vaccines.
COVID-19 has significantly affected local state, national and global
health and economic activity and its future effects are
uncertain and will depend on various factors, including, among others, the duration
and scope of the pandemic, especially
new variants of the virus, effective vaccines and drug treatments, together
with governmental, regulatory and private sector
responses. COVID-19 has had continuing significant effects
on the economy, financial
markets and our employees,
customers and vendors. Our business, financial condition and results of operations
generally rely upon the ability of our
borrowers to make deposits and repay their loans, the value of collateral underlying our
secured loans, market value,
stability and liquidity and demand for loans and other products and services we offer,
all of which are affected by the
pandemic.
We have implemented
a number of procedures in response to the pandemic to support the safety and well-being of our
employees, customers and shareholders.
•
We believe our business continuity
plan has worked to provide essential banking services to our communities and
customers, while protecting our employees’ health.
As part of our efforts to exercise social distancing in
accordance with the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and the Governor
of the State of Alabama,
starting March 23, 2020, we limited branch lobby service to appointment only while continuing
to operate our
branch drive-thru facilities and ATMs.
As permitted by state public health guidelines, on June 1, 2020, we re-
opened some of our branch lobbies.
In 2021, we opened our remaining branch lobbies.
We continue to provide
services through our online and other electronic channels.
In addition, we maintain remote work access to help
employees stay at home while providing continuity of service.
•
We are focused on servicing
the financial needs of our commercial and consumer clients with extensions
and
deferrals to loan customers effected by COVID-19, provided
such customers were not more than 30 days past due
at the time of the request; and
•
We
were an active PPP lender. PPP loans were forgivable,
in whole or in part, if the proceeds are used for payroll
and other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements of the PPP.
These loans carry a fixed rate of
1.00% and a term of two years (loans made before June 5, 2020) or five years (loans
made on or after June 5,
2020), if not forgiven, in whole or in part.
Payments are deferred until either the date on which the Small Business
Administration (“SBA”) remits the amount of forgiveness proceeds
to the lender or the date that is 10 months after
the last day of the covered period if the borrower does not apply for forgiveness
within that 10-month period.
We
believe these loans and our participation in the program helped our customers and the communities
we serve.
COVID-19 has also had various economic effects, generally.
These include supply chain disruptions and manufacturing
delays, shortages of certain goods and services, reduced consumer expenditure on
hospitality and travel, and migration from
larger urban centers to less populated areas and remote work.
The demand for single family housing has exceeded existing
supplies.
When coupled with construction delays attributable to supply chain disruptions
and worker shortages, these
factors have caused housing prices and apartment rents to increase, generally.
Stimulative monetary and fiscal policy,
along with shortages of certain goods and services, and rising petroleum and food prices
have led to the highest inflation in
decades.
Although fiscal stimulus remains under consideration by the President and Congress,
the Federal Reserve is
considering increasing its target interest rates and reducing its holding of
securities to stem inflation.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting and financial reporting policies of the Company conform
with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles and with general practices within the banking industry.
In connection with the application of those principles, we
have made judgments and estimates which, in the case of the determination of our allowance
for loan losses, our
assessment of other-than-temporary impairment, recurring and
non-recurring fair value measurements, the valuation of
other real estate owned, and the valuation of deferred tax assets, were critical to the determination
of our financial position
and results of operations. Other policies also require subjective judgment and assumptions
and may accordingly impact our
financial position and results of operations.
Allowance for Loan Losses
The Company assesses the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses prior
to the end of each calendar quarter. The level of
the allowance is based upon management’s
evaluation of the loan portfolio, past loan loss experience, current asset quality
trends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect
a borrower’s ability to repay (including
the timing of future payment), the estimated value of any underlying collateral,
composition of the loan portfolio, economic
conditions, industry and peer bank loan loss rates and other pertinent factors, including regulatory
recommendations. This
evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the
amounts and timing of future cash flows
expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change. Loans are
charged off, in whole or
in part, when management believes that the full collectability of the loan is unlikely.
A loan may be partially charged-off
after a “confirming event” has occurred which serves to validate that full repayment pursuant
to the terms of the loan is
unlikely.
The Company deems loans impaired when, based on current information and events, it is
probable that the Company will
be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
Collection of all amounts due
according to the contractual terms means that both the interest and principal payments of a
loan will be collected as
scheduled in the loan agreement.
An impairment allowance is recognized if the fair value of the loan is less than the recorded
investment in the loan. The
impairment is recognized through the allowance. Loans that are impaired are
recorded at the present value of expected
future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective
interest rate, or if the loan is collateral dependent, impairment
measurement is based on the fair value of the collateral, less estimated disposal costs.
The level of allowance maintained is believed by management to be adequate
to absorb probable losses inherent in the
portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is increased by provisions charged
to expense and decreased by charge-
offs, net of recoveries of amounts previously charged-off.
In assessing the adequacy of the allowance, the Company also considers the results of its
ongoing internal, independent
loan review process. The Company’s loan
review process assists in determining whether there are loans in the portfolio
whose credit quality has weakened over time and evaluating the risk characteristics of the
entire loan portfolio. The
Company’s loan review process includes the judgment
of management, the input from our independent loan reviewers, and
reviews that may have been conducted by bank regulatory agencies as part of their examination
process. The Company
incorporates loan review results in the determination of whether or not it is probable
that it will be able to collect all
amounts due according to the contractual terms of a loan.
As part of the Company’s quarterly assessment
of the allowance, management divides the loan portfolio into five segments:
commercial and industrial, construction and land development, commercial real estate, residential
real estate, and consumer
installment loans. The Company
analyzes each segment and estimates an allowance allocation for each loan
segment.
The allocation of the allowance for loan losses begins with a process of estimating the
probable losses inherent for these
types of loans. The estimates for these loans are established by category and based
on the Company’s internal system of
credit risk ratings and historical loss data. The estimated loan loss allocation rate for the Company’s
internal system of
credit risk grades is based on its experience with similarly graded loans. For
loan segments where the Company believes it
does not have sufficient historical loss data, the Company may
make adjustments based, in part, on loss rates of peer bank
groups. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, and for the years then ended, the Company adjusted
its historical loss rates for the
commercial real estate portfolio segment based, in part, on loss rates of peer bank groups.
The estimated loan loss allocation for all five loan portfolio segments is then adjusted for management’s
estimate of
probable losses for several “qualitative and environmental” factors.
The allocation for qualitative and environmental
factors is particularly subjective and does not lend itself to exact mathematical calculation.
This amount represents
estimated probable inherent credit losses which exist, but have not yet been identified, as of
the balance sheet date, and are
based upon quarterly trend assessments in delinquent and nonaccrual loans, credit
concentration changes, prevailing
economic conditions, changes in lending personnel experience, changes in lending
policies or procedures and other
influencing factors.
These qualitative and environmental factors are considered for each of the five loan segments
and the
allowance allocation, as determined by the processes noted above, is increased or
decreased based on the incremental
assessment of these factors.
The Company regularly re-evaluates its practices in determining the allowance
for loan losses. Since the fourth quarter of
2016, the Company has increased its look-back period each quarter to incorporate
the effects of at least one economic
downturn in its loss history. The Company believes
the extension of its look-back period is appropriate due to the risks
inherent in the loan portfolio. Absent this extension, the early cycle periods in
which the Company experienced significant
losses would be excluded from the determination of the allowance for loan losses and its balance
would decrease. For the
year ended December 31, 2021, the Company increased its look-back period to
51 quarters to continue to include losses
incurred by the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2009. The Company
will likely continue to increase its look-
back period to incorporate the effects of at least one economic downturn in
its loss history. During 2020,
the Company
adjusted certain qualitative and economic factors related to changes in economic conditions
driven by the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions, including
higher unemployment in our primary market
area.
During 2021, the Company adjusted certain qualitative and economic factors to reflect
improvements in economic
conditions in our primary market area.
Further adjustments may be made in the future as a result of the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic.
Assessment for Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment of Securities
On a quarterly basis, management makes an assessment to determine
whether there have been events or economic
circumstances to indicate that a security on which there is an unrealized loss is other-than-temporarily
impaired.
For debt securities with an unrealized loss, an other-than-temporary
impairment write-down is triggered when (1) the
Company has the intent to sell a debt security,
(2) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the
debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) the Company does not expect
to recover the entire amortized
cost basis of the debt security.
If the Company has the intent to sell a debt security or if it is more likely than not that it
will
be required to sell the debt security before recovery,
the other-than-temporary write-down is equal to the entire difference
between the debt security’s amortized cost
and its fair value.
If the Company does not intend to sell the security or it is not
more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery,
the other-than-temporary impairment write-
down is separated into the amount that is credit related (credit loss component) and the amount due
to all other factors.
The
credit loss component is recognized in earnings and is the difference between
the security’s amortized cost basis and
the
present value of its expected future cash flows.
The remaining difference between the security’s
fair value and the present
value of future expected cash flows is due to factors that are not credit related and is recognized in other comprehensive
income, net of applicable taxes.
The Company is required to own certain stock as a condition of membership, such as
Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”)
and Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”).
These non-marketable equity securities are accounted for at cost
which equals par or
redemption value.
These securities do not have a readily determinable fair value as their ownership is restricted and
there is
no market for these securities.
The Company records these non-marketable equity securities as a component
of other
assets, which are periodically evaluated for impairment. Management considers
these non-marketable equity securities to
be long-term investments. Accordingly,
when evaluating these securities for impairment, management considers
the
ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than by recognizing temporary declines in
value.
Fair Value
Determination
U.S. GAAP requires management to value and disclose certain of the Company’s
assets and liabilities at fair value,
including investments classified as available-for-sale and derivatives.
ASC 820,
Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures
,
which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance
with U.S. GAAP and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements.
For more information regarding fair value measurements and disclosures,
please refer to Note 14, Fair Value,
of the consolidated financial statements that accompany this report.
Fair values are based on active market prices of identical assets or liabilities when available.
Comparable assets or
liabilities or a composite of comparable assets in active markets are used when identical assets
or liabilities do not have
readily available active market pricing.
However, some of the Company’s
assets or liabilities lack an available or
comparable trading market characterized by frequent transactions between
willing buyers and sellers. In these cases, fair
value is estimated using pricing models that use discounted cash flows and
other pricing techniques. Pricing models and
their underlying assumptions are based upon management’s
best estimates for appropriate discount rates, default rates,
prepayments, market volatility and other factors, taking into account current observable
market data and experience.
These assumptions may have a significant effect on the reported
fair values of assets and liabilities and the related income
and expense. As such, the use of different models and assumptions, as
well as changes in market conditions, could result in
materially different net earnings and retained earnings results.
Other Real Estate Owned
Other real estate owned (“OREO”), consists of properties obtained through foreclosure or
in satisfaction of loans and is
reported at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated costs to sell at the date acquired with any loss
recognized as a
charge-off through the allowance for loan losses. Additional
OREO losses for subsequent valuation adjustments are
determined on a specific property basis and are included as a component of other noninterest
expense along with holding
costs. Any gains or losses on disposal of OREO are also reflected in noninterest expense.
Significant judgments and
complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of OREO, and the period of time
within which such estimates
can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of
market volatility. As a result, the net proceeds
realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from
appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates used to
determine the fair value of OREO.
Deferred Tax
Asset Valuation
A valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of available
evidence, it is more-likely-
than-not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. The
ultimate realization of deferred tax assets
is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods
in which those temporary differences become
deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred
tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax
planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of taxable income over
the last three years and
projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are
deductible, management believes
it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences
at December 31, 2021. The amount
of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however,
could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income are
reduced.

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
Net Interest Income and Margin
Net interest income (tax-equivalent) was $24.5 million in 2021, compared
to $24.8 million in 2020.
This decrease was due
to a decline in the Company’s net interest
margin (tax-equivalent),
partially offset by balance sheet growth.
The tax-equivalent yield on total interest-earning assets decreased by 57 basis points
in 2021 from 2020 to 2.81%.
This
decrease was primarily due to the lower rate environment and changes in our asset
mix from the significant increase in
deposits from government stimulus and relief programs and customers’ increased savings.
The cost of total interest-bearing liabilities decreased 29 basis points to 0.39%
in 2021 compared to 0.68 in 2020.
The net
decrease in our funding costs was primarily due to lower prevailing market interest rates.
Our funding costs declined less
than the rates earned on our interest earning assets.
The Company continues to deploy various asset liability management strategies
to manage its risk to interest rate
fluctuations. The Company’s
net interest margin could experience pressure due to reduced earning asset
yields and
increased competition for quality loan opportunities.
Provision for Loan Losses
The provision for loan losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to provide
an allowance for loan losses that
management believes, based on its processes and estimates, should be adequate
to provide for the probable losses on
outstanding loans. The Company recorded a negative provision for loan losses of $0.6
million during 2021, compared to
$1.1 million in provision for loan losses during 2020.
The negative provision for loan losses was primarily related to
improvements in economic conditions in our primary market area.
The provision for loan losses is based upon various
factors, including the absolute level of loans, loan growth, the credit quality,
and the amount of net charge-offs or
recoveries.
Based upon its assessment of the loan portfolio, management adjusts the allowance
for loan losses to an amount it believes
should be appropriate to adequately cover its estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio.
The Company’s allowance
for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.08% at December 31, 2021, compared
to 1.22% at December 31, 2020.
Excluding PPP loans, which are guaranteed by the SBA, the Company’s
allowance for loan losses was 1.10% and 1.27% of
total loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
While the policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance
for loan losses, as well as the resulting provision for loan losses charged to operations,
are considered adequate by
management and are reviewed from time to time by our regulators, they are based on estimates
and judgments and are
therefore approximate and imprecise. Factors beyond our control (such as conditions

The decrease in service charges on deposit accounts was primarily driven by a decline
in consumer spending activity as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Company’s income from mortgage lending
is primarily attributable to the (1) origination and sale of new mortgage
loans and (2) servicing of mortgage loans. Origination income, net, is comprised of gains
or losses from the sale of the
mortgage loans originated, origination fees, underwriting fees and other fees associated
with the origination of loans, which
are netted against the commission expense associated with these originations. The
Company’s normal practice is to
originate mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market and to either sell or
retain the MSRs when the loan is sold.
MSRs are recognized based on the fair value of the servicing right on the date the corresponding
mortgage loan is sold.
Subsequent to the date of transfer, the Company
has elected to measure its MSRs under the amortization method.
Servicing
fee income is reported net of any related amortization expense.
The Company evaluates MSRs for impairment on a quarterly basis.
Impairment is determined by grouping MSRs by
common predominant characteristics, such as interest rate and loan type.
If the aggregate carrying amount of a particular
group of MSRs exceeds the group’s aggregate fair
value, a valuation allowance for that group is established.
The valuation
allowance is adjusted as the fair value changes.
An increase in mortgage interest rates typically results in an increase in the
fair value of the MSRs while a decrease in mortgage interest rates typically results in a decrease
in the fair value of MSRs.
The following table presents a breakdown of the Company’s
mortgage lending income for 2021 and 2020.

The Company’s income from mortgage lending
typically fluctuates as mortgage interest rates change and is primarily
attributable to the origination and sale of new mortgage loans. Origination income
decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 due
to a decrease in refinance activity in our primary market.
The decrease in origination income was partially offset by an
increase in servicing fees, net of related amortization expense as prepayment
speeds slowed during 2021, resulting in
decreased amortization expense.
Income from bank-owned life insurance decreased primarily due to $0.3
million in non-taxable death benefits received in
2020. The assets that support these policies are administered by the life insurance carriers
and the income we receive (i.e.,
increases or decreases in the cash surrender value of the policies and death benefits received)
on these policies is dependent
upon the returns the insurance carriers are able to earn on the underlying investments that
support these policies. Earnings
on these policies are generally not taxable.

The increase in salaries and benefits expense was primarily due to a decrease in deferred
costs related to the PPP loan
program, routine annual wage and benefit increases, and management increasing the
minimum hourly wage for banking
positions to $15.
The decrease in net occupancy and equipment was primarily due to a reduction
of various expenses related to the
redevelopment of the Company’s headquarters
in downtown Auburn.
This amount includes revised depreciation estimates
and other temporary relocation costs. For more information regarding changes
in accounting estimates, please refer to Note
1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the consolidated financial statements
that accompany this report.
The increase in FDIC and other regulatory assessments was primarily due to the expiration
of FDIC assessment credits
during 2020 and an increased assessment base during 2021.
Income Tax
Expense
Income tax expense was $1.4 million in 2021 and $1.6 million in 2020.
The Company’s effective income
tax rate was
14.89% in 2021, compared to 17.72% in 2020.
This change was primarily due to an income tax benefit related to a New
Markets Tax Credit investment
funded in the fourth quarter of 2021.
The Company’s effective income
tax rate is
principally impacted by tax-exempt earnings from the Company’s
investments in municipal securities, bank-owned life
insurance, and New Markets Tax
Credits.
BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS
Securities
Securities available-for-sale were $421.9
million at December 31, 2021, compared to $335.2 million at December 31, 2020.
This increase reflects an increase in the amortized cost basis of securities available-for-sale
of $95.7 million, and a decrease
of $9.0 million in the fair value of securities available-for-sale.
The increase in the amortized cost basis of securities
available-for-sale was primarily attributable to management
allocating more funding to the investment portfolio following
the significant increases in customer deposits. The decrease in the fair value of securities
was primarily due to an increase
in long-term interest rates. The average annualized tax-equivalent
yields earned on total securities were 1.66%
in 2021 and
2.11%
in 2020.
The following table shows the carrying value and weighted average yield of securities available
-for-sale as of December
31, 2021 according to contractual maturity.
Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities of mortgage-backed
securities (“MBS”) because the mortgages underlying the securities may be called
or prepaid with or without penalty.

Total loans, net of unearned income,

Excluding PPP loans, total loans, net of unearned income, were $450.5
million, an increase of $7.5 million, or 2% from
December 31, 2020.
This increase was primarily due to an increase in commercial and industrial loans
,
net of PPP,
of
$12.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in residential real estate loans of
$6.5 million, as lower rates increased refinance
activity and payoffs for consumer mortgage loans.
Four loan categories represented the majority of the loan portfolio at
December 31, 2021: commercial real estate (56%), residential real estate (17%),
commercial and industrial (18%) and
construction and land development (7%).
Approximately 25% of the Company’s commercial
real estate loans were
classified as owner-occupied at December 31, 2021.
Within the residential real estate portfolio
segment, the Company had junior lien mortgages of approximately $7.2 million,
or 2%, and $8.7 million, or 2%, of total loans, net of unearned income at December 31,
2021 and 2020, respectively.
For
residential real estate mortgage loans with a consumer purpose, the Company
had no loans that required interest only
payments at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Company’s
residential real estate mortgage portfolio does not include any
option ARM loans, subprime loans, or any material amount of other high-risk consumer
mortgage products.
The average yield earned on loans and loans held for sale was 4.45% in 2021
and 4.74% in 2020.
The specific economic and credit risks associated with our loan portfolio include,
but are not limited to, the effects of
current economic conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic’s
effects, on our borrowers’ cash flows, real estate market
sales volumes, valuations, availability and cost of financing properties,
real estate industry concentrations, competitive
pressures from a wide range of other lenders, deterioration in certain credits, interest rate
fluctuations, reduced collateral
values or non-existent collateral, title defects, inaccurate appraisals, financial deterioration
of borrowers, fraud, and any
violation of applicable laws and regulations.
The Company attempts to reduce these economic and credit risks through its loan-to-value
guidelines for collateralized
loans, investigating the creditworthiness of borrowers and monitoring borrowers’ financial
position. Also, we have
established and periodically review,
lending policies and procedures. Banking regulations limit a bank’s
credit exposure by
prohibiting unsecured loan relationships that exceed 10% of its capital; or 20%
of capital, if loans in excess of 10% of
capital are fully secured. Under these regulations, we are prohibited from having secured
loan relationships in excess of
approximately $21.0 million. Furthermore, we have an internal limit
for aggregate credit exposure (loans outstanding plus
unfunded commitments) to a single borrower of $18.9
million. Our loan policy requires that the Loan Committee of the
Board of Directors approve any loan relationships that exceed this internal limit.
At December 31, 2021, the Bank had no
relationships exceeding these limits.
We periodically analyze
our commercial loan portfolio to determine if a concentration of credit
risk exists in any one or
more industries. We
use classification systems broadly accepted by the financial services industry in
order to categorize our
commercial borrowers. Loan concentrations to borrowers in the following classes
exceeded 25% of the Bank’s total risk-
based capital at December 31, 2021 (and related balances at December 31,
2020).

In light of disruptions in economic conditions caused by COVID-19, the financial regulators
have issued guidance
encouraging banks to work constructively with borrowers affected
by the virus in our community.
This guidance, including
the Interagency Statement on COVID-19 Loan Modifications and the Interagency Examiner
Guidance for Assessing Safety
and Soundness Considering the Effect of the COVID-19
Pandemic on Institutions, provides that the agencies will not
criticize financial institutions that mitigate credit risk through prudent actions
consistent with safe and sound practices.
Specifically, examiners
will not criticize institutions for working with borrowers as part of a risk
mitigation strategy
intended to improve existing loans, even if the restructured loans have or develop
weaknesses that ultimately result in
adverse credit classification.
Upon demonstrating the need for payment relief, the bank will work with qualified borrowers
that were otherwise current before the pandemic to determine the most appropriate
deferral option.
For residential
mortgage and consumer loans the borrower may elect to defer payments for up to three
months.
Interest continues to
accrue and the amount due at maturity increases.
Commercial real estate, commercial, and small business borrowers may
elect to defer payments for up to three months or pay scheduled interest payments for a
six-month period.
The bank
recognizes that a combination of the payment relief options may be prudent dependent
on a borrower’s business type.
As
of December 31, 2021, we had one COVID-19 loan deferral totaling $0.1
million, compared to $32.3 million, or 7% of total
loans at December 31, 2020.

modifications as of December 31,

There were no COVID-19 modifications within the commercial real estate segment at December
31, 2021.
Section 4013 of the CARES Act provides that a qualified loan modification is exempt by law
from classification as a TDR
pursuant to GAAP.
In addition, the Interagency Statement on COVID-19 Loan Modifications provides
circumstances in
which a loan modification is not subject to classification as a TDR if such loan is not eligible
for modification under
Section 4013.
Allowance for Loan Losses
The Company maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that management believes
appropriate to adequately cover
the Company’s estimate of probable
losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The
allowance for loan losses was $4.9 million at
December 31, 2021 compared to $5.6 million at December 31, 2020,
which management believed to be adequate at each of
the respective dates. The judgments and estimates associated
with the determination of the allowance for loan losses are
described under “Critical Accounting Policies.”
A summary of the changes in the allowance for loan losses and certain asset quality ratios
for the years ended December 31,
2021 and 2020 are presented below.

As described under “Critical Accounting Policies”, management assesses the adequacy
of the allowance prior to the end of
each calendar quarter. The level of the allowance
is based upon management’s evaluation
of the loan portfolios, past loan
loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that
may affect the borrower’s ability to repay
(including the timing of future payment), the estimated value of any underlying
collateral, composition of the loan
portfolio, economic conditions, industry and peer bank loan loss rates, and other
pertinent factors. This evaluation is
inherently subjective as it requires various material estimates and judgments including
the amounts and timing of future
cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to
significant change. The ratio of our
allowance for loan losses to total loans outstanding was 1.08% at December 31,
2021, compared to 1.22% at December 31,
2020.
Excluding PPP loans, which are guaranteed by the SBA, the Company’s
allowance for loan losses was 1.10% and
1.27% of total loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
In the future, the allowance to total loans outstanding
ratio will increase or decrease to the extent the factors that influence our quarterly allowance
assessment, including the
duration and magnitude of COVID-19 effects, in their entirety either improve
or weaken.
In addition our regulators, as an
integral part of their examination process, will periodically review the Company’s
allowance for loan losses, and may
require the Company to make additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses based
on their judgment about
information available to them at the time of their examinations.
Nonperforming Assets
At December 31, 2021 the Company had $0.8

Potential Problem Loans
Potential problem loans represent those loans with a well-defined weakness and
where information about possible credit
problems of borrowers has caused management to have serious doubts about the
borrower’s ability to comply with present
repayment terms.
This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards
established by the Federal
Reserve, the Company’s primary regulator,
for loans classified as substandard, excluding nonaccrual loans.
Potential
problem loans, which are not included in nonperforming assets, amounted to $2.4
million, or 0.5% of total loans at
December 31, 2021, compared to $2.9 million, or 1.0% of total loans at December 31, 2020.

million, or 32% of total deposits, at December 31, 2021,
compared to $245.4 million, or 29% of total deposits at December 31, 2020. These
increases reflect deposits from
customers who received PPP loans, the impact of government stimulus checks, and
reduced customer spending during the
COVID-19 pandemic.
Estimated uninsured deposits totaled $420.8 million and $315.2 million at December 31,
2021 and 2020, respectively.
Uninsured amounts are estimated based on the portion of account balances in excess of FDIC
insurance limits.
The average rates paid on total interest-bearing deposits were 0.39%
in 2021 and 0.68% in 2020.
Other Borrowings
Other borrowings generally consist of short-term borrowings and long-term debt.
Short-term borrowings generally consist
of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase
with an original maturity of one year or less.
The Bank had available federal fund lines totaling $41.0 million with none outstanding
at December 31, 2021 and 2020,
respectively. Securities sold under
agreements to repurchase totaled $3.4 million and $2.4 million at December 31,
and 2020, respectively.
The average rates paid on short-term borrowings were 0.51% and 0.48%
in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The Company had no long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
CAPITAL ADEQUACY
The Company's consolidated stockholders' equity was $103.7 million and $107.7
million as of December 31, 2021 and
2020,
respectively.
The decrease from December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by an other comprehensive
loss due to the
change in unrealized gains on securities available-for-sale, net of tax, of $6.7
million, cash dividends paid of $3.7
million
and stock repurchases of $1.6 million, representing 45,946 shares,
which was partially offset by net earnings of $8.0
million.
On January 1, 2015, the Company and Bank became subject to the rules of the Basel III regulatory
capital framework and
related Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act changes. The rules included
the implementation of a
capital conservation buffer that is added to the minimum requirements
for capital adequacy purposes. The capital
conservation buffer was subject to a three year phase-in period
that began on January 1, 2016 and was fully phased-in on
January 1, 2019 at 2.5%. A banking organization with a conservation buffer
of less than the required amount will be subject
to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary
bonus payments to executive
officers. At December 31, 2021, the Bank’s
ratio was sufficient to meet the fully phased-in conservation
buffer.
Effective March 20, 2020, the Federal Reserve and the other federal
banking regulators adopted an interim final rule that
amended the capital conservation buffer.
The interim final rule was adopted as a final rule on August 26, 2020. The
new
rule revises the definition of “eligible retained income” for purposes of the maximum payout
ratio to allow banking
organizations to more freely use their capital buffers to promote
lending and other financial intermediation activities, by
making the limitations on capital distributions more gradual. The
eligible retained income is now the greater of (i) net
income for the four preceding quarters, net of distributions and associated tax effects
not reflected in net income; and (ii)
the average of all net income over the preceding four quarters. The interim
final rule only affects the capital buffers, and
banking organizations were encouraged to make prudent capital
distribution decisions.
The Federal Reserve has treated us as a “small bank holding company’ under the Federal
Reserve’s policy.
Accordingly,
our capital adequacy is evaluated at the Bank level, and not for the Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries. The Bank’s
tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.35%, CET1 risk-based capital ratio was 16.23%, tier 1 risk-based
capital ratio was 16.23%, and
total risk-based capital ratio was 17.06%
at December 31, 2021. These ratios exceed the minimum regulatory capital
percentages of 5.0% for tier 1 leverage ratio, 6.5% for CET1 risk-based capital ratio,
8.0% for tier 1 risk-based capital ratio,
and 10.0% for total risk-based capital ratio to be considered “well capitalized.”
The Bank’s capital conservation buffer
was
9.06%
at December 31, 2021.
MARKET AND LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT
Management’s objective is to manage assets and
liabilities to provide a satisfactory,
consistent level of profitability within
the framework of established liquidity,
loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. The Bank’s
Asset Liability
Management Committee (“ALCO”) is charged with the responsibility
of monitoring these policies, which are designed to
ensure an acceptable asset/liability composition. Two
critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate risk and liquidity
risk management.
Interest Rate Risk Management
In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to market risk arising from
fluctuations in interest rates because
assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times. For example,
if liabilities reprice faster than assets, and
interest rates are generally rising, earnings will initially decline. In addition, assets
and liabilities may reprice at the same
time but by different amounts. For example, when the general level of interest rates is rising,
the Company may increase
rates paid on interest bearing demand deposit accounts and savings deposit
accounts by an amount that is less than the
general increase in market interest rates. Also, short-term and long-term
market interest rates may change by different
amounts. For example, a flattening yield curve may reduce the interest spread
between new loan yields and funding costs.
Further, the remaining maturity of various assets and
liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For
example, if long-term mortgage interest rates decline sharply,
mortgage-backed securities in the securities portfolio may
prepay earlier than anticipated, which could reduce earnings. Interest rates may also
have a direct or indirect effect on loan
demand, loan losses, mortgage origination volume, the fair value of MSRs and other
items affecting earnings.
ALCO measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands
for various types of loans and
deposits. ALCO determines the most appropriate amounts of on-balance sheet and
off-balance sheet items. Measurements
used to help manage interest rate sensitivity include an earnings simulation and an economic
value of equity model.
Earnings simulation
. Management believes that interest rate risk is best estimated by our earnings simulation
modeling.
On at least a quarterly basis, the following 12 month time period is simulated to determine a
baseline net interest income
forecast and the sensitivity of this forecast to changes in interest rates. The baseline forecast
assumes an unchanged or flat
interest rate environment. Forecasted levels of earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities,
and off-balance sheet financial
instruments are combined with ALCO forecasts of market interest rates for
the next 12 months and other factors in order to
produce various earnings simulations and estimates.
To help limit interest rate risk,
we have guidelines for earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest
income from gradual changes in interest rates.
For changes up or down in rates from management’s
flat interest rate
forecast over the next 12 months, policy limits for net interest income variances are as follows:
+/- 20% for a gradual change of 400 basis points
+/- 15% for a gradual change of 300 basis points
+/- 10% for a gradual change of 200 basis points
+/- 5% for a gradual change of 100 basis points
The following table reports the variance of net interest income over the next 12
months assuming a gradual change in
interest rates up or down when compared to the baseline net interest income
forecast at December 31, 2021.

At December 31, 2021, our earnings simulation model indicated that
we were in compliance with the policy guidelines
noted above.
Economic Value
of Equity
Economic value of equity (“EVE”) measures the extent that estimated econom
ic values of our assets, liabilities and off-
balance sheet items will change as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are
estimated by discounting expected
cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items,
which establishes a base case EVE. In contrast with our
earnings simulation model which evaluates interest rate risk over a 12
month timeframe, EVE uses a terminal horizon
which allows for the re-pricing of all assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet items.
Further, EVE is measured using values
as of a point in time and does not reflect any actions that ALCO might take in responding to
or anticipating changes in
interest rates, or market and competitive conditions.
To help limit interest rate risk,
we have stated policy guidelines for an instantaneous basis point change in interest rates,
such that our EVE should not decrease from our base case by more than the following:
45% for an instantaneous change of +/- 400 basis points
35% for an instantaneous change of +/- 300 basis points
25% for an instantaneous change of +/- 200 basis points
15% for an instantaneous change of +/- 100 basis points
The following table reports the variance of EVE assuming an immediate change in
interest rates up or down when
compared to the baseline EVE at December 31, 2021.

At December 31, 2021, our EVE model indicated that we were in compliance
with the policy guidelines noted above.
Each of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how our net interest
income will be affected by
changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated
with interest-bearing liabilities
may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition,
the magnitude and duration of changes in interest
rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain
assets and liabilities may have
similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different
degrees to changes in market interest rates, and other
economic and market factors, including market perceptions.
Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate
in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types of assets
and liabilities may lag behind
changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate
mortgage loans, have features (generally
referred to as “interest rate caps and floors”) which limit changes in interest rates.
Prepayment and early withdrawal levels
also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments.
The ability of many
borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates or
economic stress, which may
differ across industries and economic sectors. ALCO reviews each of the
above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with
several different interest rate scenarios in seeking satisfactory,
consistent levels of profitability within the framework of the
Company’s established liquidity,
loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies.
The Company may also use derivative financial instruments to improve the balance between
interest-sensitive assets and
interest-sensitive liabilities and as one tool to manage interest rate sensitivity
while continuing to meet the credit and
deposit needs of our customers. From time to time, the Company may enter into
interest rate swaps (“swaps”) to facilitate
customer transactions and meet their financing needs. These swaps qualify as derivatives,
but are not designated as hedging
instruments. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had no derivative
contracts to assist in managing interest rate
sensitivity.
Liquidity Risk Management
Liquidity is the Company’s ability to convert
assets into cash equivalents in order to meet daily cash flow requirements,
primarily for deposit withdrawals, loan demand and maturing obligations. Without
proper management of its liquidity,
the
Company could experience higher costs of obtaining funds due to insufficient liquidity,
while excessive liquidity can lead
to a decline in earnings due to the cost of foregoing alternative higher-yielding
investment opportunities.
Liquidity is managed at two levels. The first is the liquidity of the Company.
The second is the liquidity of the Bank. The
management of liquidity at both levels is essential, because the Company and the Bank are
separate and distinct legal
entities with different funding needs and sources, and each are subject
to regulatory guidelines and requirements. The
Company depends upon dividends from the Bank for liquidity to pay its operating expenses,
debt obligations and
dividends. The Bank’s payment of dividends depends
on its earnings, liquidity,
capital and the absence of any regulatory
restrictions.
The primary source of funding and liquidity for the Company has been dividends received
from the Bank. If needed, the
Company could also issue common stock or other securities. Primary uses of funds by the
Company include dividends paid
to stockholders and stock repurchases.
Primary sources of funding for the Bank include customer deposits, other borrowings,
repayment and maturity of securities,
and sale and repayment of loans.
The Bank has access to federal funds lines from various banks and borrowings
from the
Federal Reserve discount window.
In addition to these sources, the Bank has participated in the FHLB's advance program
to obtain funding for its growth. Advances include both fixed and variable terms and
are taken out with varying maturities.
As of December 31, 2021, the Bank had a remaining available line of credit with the FHLB
totaling $319.6 million.
As of
December 31, 2021, the Bank also had $41.0 million of federal funds lines, with none outstanding.
Primary uses of funds
include repayment of maturing obligations and growing the loan portfolio.
The following table presents additional information about our contractual obligations
as of December 31, 2021, which by
their terms had contractual maturity and termination dates subsequent to December
31, 2021:

Management believes that the Company and the Bank have adequate sources of liquidity to
meet all known contractual
obligations and unfunded commitments, including loan commitments and reasonable borrower,
depositor, and creditor
requirements over the next 12 months.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
At December 31, 2021, the Bank had outstanding standby letters of credit of $1.
million and unfunded loan commitments
outstanding of $71.0 million. Because these commitments generally
have fixed expiration dates and many will expire
without being drawn upon, the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future
cash requirements. If needed to
fund these outstanding commitments, the Bank has the ability to liquidate federal funds
sold or securities available-for-sale,
or on a short-term basis to borrow and purchase federal funds from other financial
institutions.
Residential mortgage lending and servicing activities
We primarily sell conforming
residential mortgage loans in the secondary market to Fannie Mae
while retaining the
servicing of these loans. The sale agreements for these residential mortgage loans with
Fannie Mae and other investors
include various representations and warranties regarding the origination and characteristics
of the residential mortgage
loans. Although the representations and warranties vary among investors, they typically
cover ownership of the loan,
validity of the lien securing the loan, the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing
the loan,
compliance with loan criteria set forth in the applicable agreement, compliance with applicable
federal, state, and local
laws, among other matters.
As of December 31, 2021, the unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans,
which we have originated and sold,
but retained the servicing rights was $252.7 million. Although these loans are
generally sold on a non-recourse basis,
except for breaches of customary seller representations and warranties,
we may have to repurchase residential mortgage
loans in cases where we breach such representations or warranties or the other terms of
the sale, such as where we fail to
deliver required documents or the documents we deliver are defective. Investors also
may require the repurchase of a
mortgage loan when an early payment default underwriting review reveals significant
underwriting deficiencies, even if the
mortgage loan has subsequently been brought current. Repurchase demands are typically
reviewed on an individual loan by
loan basis to validate the claims made by the investor and to determine if a contractually
required repurchase event has
occurred. We
seek to reduce and manage the risks of potential repurchases or other claims by mortgage loan investors
through our underwriting, quality assurance and servicing practices, including
good communications with our residential
mortgage investors.
The Company was not required to repurchase any loans during 2021 and 2020
as a result of representation and warranty
provisions contained in the Company’s sale agreements
with Fannie Mae, and had no pending repurchase or make-whole
requests at December 31, 2021.
We service all residential
mortgage loans originated and sold by us to Fannie Mae. As servicer,
our primary duties are to:
(1) collect payments due from borrowers; (2) advance certain delinquent payments
of principal and interest; (3) maintain
and administer any hazard, title, or primary mortgage insurance policies relating to
the mortgage loans; (4) maintain any
required escrow accounts for payment of taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments;
and (5) foreclose on
defaulted mortgage loans or take other actions to mitigate the potential losses to investors
consistent with the agreements
governing our rights and duties as servicer.
The agreement under which we act as servicer generally specifies a
standard of responsibility for actions taken by us in
such capacity and provides protection against expenses and liabilities incurred by us
when acting in compliance with the
respective servicing agreements. However, if
we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer,
we may be subject
to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period following notice. The
standards governing servicing and
the possible remedies for violations of such standards are determined by servicing
guides issued by Fannie Mae as well as
the contract provisions established between Fannie Mae and the Bank.
Remedies could include repurchase of an affected
loan.
Although to date repurchase requests related to representation and warranty provisions,
and servicing activities have been
limited, it is possible that requests to repurchase mortgage loans may increase in frequency
if investors more aggressively
pursue all means of recovering losses on their purchased loans. As of December
31, 2021, we believe that this exposure is
not material due to the historical level of repurchase requests and loss trends, the results of
our quality control reviews, and
the fact that 99% of our residential mortgage loans serviced for Fannie Mae
were current as of such date. We
maintain
ongoing communications with our investors and will continue to evaluate this exposure
by monitoring the level and number
of repurchase requests as well as the delinquency rates in our investor portfolios.
Section 4021 of the CARES Act allows borrowers under 1-to-4 family residential
mortgage loans sold to Fannie Mae to
request forbearance to the servicer after affirming that such borrower
is experiencing financial hardships during the
COVID-19 emergency.
Except for vacant or abandoned properties, Fannie Mae servicers may not initiate
foreclosures on
similar procedures or related evictions or sales until December 31, 2020.
The forbearance period was extended, generally,
to March 31, 2021.
The Bank sells mortgage loans to Fannie Mae and services these on an actual/actual
basis. As a result,
the Bank is not obligated to make any advances to Fannie Mae on principal and interest on
such mortgage loans where the
borrower is entitled to forbearance.
Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices
The consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data
presented herein have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP and practices within the banking industry which require
the measurement of financial position and
operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in
the relative purchasing power of money
over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities
of a financial institution
are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a
financial institution’s performance
than the effects of general levels of inflation.
CURRENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS
The following ASU has been issued by the FASB
but is not yet effective.
●
ASU 2016-13,
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic
326):
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments;
Information about this pronouncement is described in more detail below.
ASU 2016-13,
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic
326): - Measurement of Credit
Losses on Financial
Instruments
, amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and
available for sale debt
securities. For assets held at amortized cost basis, the new standard eliminates the probable
initial recognition threshold in
current GAAP and, instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected
credit losses using a broader
range of information regarding past events, current conditions and forecasts assessing the
collectability of cash flows. The
allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized
cost basis of the financial assets to
present the net amount expected to be collected. For available for sale debt securities, credit
losses should be measured in a
manner similar to current GAAP,
however the new standard will require that credit losses be presented as an allowance
rather than as a write-down. The new guidance affects entities holding
financial assets and net investment in leases that are
not accounted for at fair value through net income. The amendments affect
loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net
investments in leases, off-balance sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables,
and any other financial assets not
excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. For public
business entities, the new guidance was
originally effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company has
developed an implementation team that is following a general timeline. The
team has been working with an advisory
consultant, with whom a third-party software license has been purchased.
The Company’s preliminary evaluation
indicates
the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 are expected to impact the Company’s
consolidated financial statements, in particular
the level of the reserve for credit losses. The Company is continuing to evaluate the
extent of the potential impact and
expects that portfolio composition and economic conditions at the time of adoption
will be a factor. On October 16, 2019,
the FASB approved
a previously issued proposal granting smaller reporting companies a postponement of the required
implementation date for ASU 2016-13. The Company will now be required
to implement the new standard in January 2023,
with early adoption permitted in any period prior to that date.
Table 1
- Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP,
this annual report on Form 10-K includes certain designated net
interest income amounts presented on a tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP financial
measure, including the presentation of
total revenue and the calculation of the efficiency ratio.
The Company believes the presentation of net interest income on a tax-equivalent
basis provides comparability of net
interest income from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and facilitates comparability
within the industry. Although the
Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures enhance investors’
understanding of its business and performance,
these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to
GAAP.
The reconciliation of these non-
GAAP financial measures from GAAP to non-GAAP is presented below.
