ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Unless otherwise stated, all monetary amounts in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, other than per share amounts, are stated in thousands.
Executive Overview
The Company designs, manufactures and markets high quality recreational products for the outdoor enthusiast. Through a combination of innovative products, strong marketing, a talented and passionate workforce and efficient distribution, the Company seeks to set itself apart from the competition in its markets. Its subsidiaries operate as a network that promotes innovation and leverages best practices and synergies, following the strategic vision set by executive management and approved by the Company’s Board of Directors.
Coronavirus (COVID-19)
The COVID-19 pandemic drove consumer desire to engage in socially distant and safe activities outdoors. As a result, increased participation in Fishing, Camping and Watercraft Recreation also increased demand for our products across Company segments beginning in fiscal 2020 and continuing throughout fiscal 2022. As global travel restrictions also eased, we experienced increased participation and resulting increased product demand in the Diving segment beginning in fiscal 2021 and continuing through fiscal 2022.
In addition to this increase in demand for Company products, COVID-19 and the resulting macroeconomic dynamics have also caused widely-documented supply chain and logistics disruptions across industries. Specifically, the adverse supply chain and logistics constraints and disruptions have impacted the timing, sourcing, availability and cost of raw materials and components that are necessary to manufacture our outdoor recreation products, especially in our Fishing segment due to the electronic components used in those products. Because certain electronic components that are necessary for manufacturing our higher volume products in that segment have been most impacted by the supply chain and logistics disruptions, there has been limited availability of those materials and components, as well as increased pricing and inflationary pressures on such components when they have become available, all of which impacted our margins during fiscal 2022. The Company has attempted to mitigate these disruptions by purchasing significantly higher levels of certain raw material and component inventory as they have been available, in many cases at higher price points than what was historically paid, to enable the Company to complete finished product orders as soon as the missing raw material and component inventory items become available. Nonetheless, shortages throughout fiscal 2022 have impacted the Fishing segment's ability to complete products for shipping, which has ultimately resulted in decreased sales volumes in the Fishing segment over the prior year, despite continued demand for our Fishing products, as evidenced by outstanding orders.
Additionally, the Company's buying actions have subsequently resulted in decreased margins and the Company carrying significantly higher levels of inventory for a number of its materials, components and products at the end of fiscal 2022. Though the Company continues to believe the inventory that it has built and which exists on its balance sheet is useable and salable in the ordinary course of business, it continues to monitor the current reserve balances for obsolete and excess inventory. However, any changes in consumer demand for the Company's outdoor recreation products, changes in economic conditions, or changes in customer inventory levels or competitive conditions could have a favorable or unfavorable effect on required reserve balances in the future.
Because the Company expects that supply chain disruptions, as well as inflationary pricing conditions for raw materials and components necessary to manufacture product, will continue into fiscal 2023, the Company remains focused on evaluating and pursuing additional options (beyond building inventory) to meet the demand for its products. During fiscal 2023 the Company expects to closely monitor customer demand and proactively manage its higher than normal inventory levels. Nonetheless, these supply chain and logistics disruptions and inflationary pricing conditions remain fluid and will likely adversely impact the cost of goods sold for future sales of product.
Highlights
The Company's fiscal 2022 and 2021 each comprised 52 weeks, whereas the fiscal year ended October 2, 2020 comprised 53 weeks. The Company’s fiscal 2022 revenues decreased by 1% from the prior year. While consumer and customer demand for the Company's products remained strong throughout fiscal 2022 as evidenced by outstanding order volumes, sales volumes were negatively impacted by product availability caused by the supply chain disruptions described above, particularly in Fishing, the Company's largest segment. This sales volume decrease and lower gross margins resulting from higher costs of sales were the primary drivers of the $44,973 decrease in operating profit in fiscal 2022 over fiscal 2021.
Results of Operations
Summary consolidated financial results from continuing operations for the fiscal years presented were as follows:
The Company’s internal and external sales and operating profit (loss) by business segment for each of the three most recent completed fiscal years were as follows:
See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for the definition of segment net sales and operating profit.
Fiscal 2022 vs. Fiscal 2021
Net Sales
Net sales in fiscal 2022 decreased by 1% to $743,355 compared to $751,651 in fiscal 2021. Foreign currency exchange had an unfavorable impact of less than 1% on the current year’s sales versus the prior year.
Net sales for the Fishing business decreased by $26,418, or 5% during fiscal 2022 from fiscal 2021. While customer and consumer demand was strong, the decrease over the prior year was driven by significant supply chain disruptions and the resulting unavailability of certain necessary components (especially as it related to electronic components) experienced in the current year, which impacted the ability to complete product build and fill customer orders. Specifically, due to the technical and electronic nature of the product categories, the Fishing segment has been the most susceptible to the previously discussed supply chain issues, as discussed in "Coronavirus (COVID-19)" above.
Camping net sales increased $7,434, or 12%, in 2022 from 2021. Increased sales of Eureka and Jetboil products as a result of continued participation in outdoor recreation activities were the primary driver of the increase year over year.
Net sales in the Watercraft Recreation business increased $1,337, or 2%. Continued new product success drove the overall increase over the prior year.
Diving net sales increased $9,427, or 14%, year over year. Prior year sales were negatively impacted due to the negative effects of COVID-19 on demand due to restrictions in destination travel and tourism. As several regions around the world have re-opened, sales volumes have increased along with the increase in tourism, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact on sales in these segment of approximately 4.5% in 2022 versus the prior year period.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales was $472,023, or 63.5% of net sales, on a consolidated basis for fiscal 2022 compared to $417,526, or 55.5% of net sales, in the prior year. Despite the decrease in sales over the prior fiscal year, the increase in cost of sales was primarily driven by significant increases in materials costs between years. The Company continues to manage disruptions in its supply chain to ensure the availability of necessary components, parts and other raw materials, in some cases at significantly higher price points than what was historically paid, to try to meet sales demand for our products across segments.
Gross Profit
Gross profit of $271,332 was 36.5% of net sales on a consolidated basis for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to $334,125, or 44.5% of net sales in the prior year.
Gross profit in the Fishing business decreased by $66,217 from the prior year due primarily to the 5% decrease in net sales year over year, as well as significant increases in materials costs, as discussed above.
Camping gross profit increased by $1,857 from 2021 due primarily to increased sales volumes, pricing actions and a favorable mix of products sold in the current year as compared to the prior year.
Gross profit in the Watercraft Recreation segment decreased by $2,525 from 2021, despite increased sales in 2022 versus the prior year, primarily due to increased materials and freight costs.
The $4,169 increase in gross profit in the Diving segment was due primarily to increased sales volumes and pricing actions during fiscal 2022 as compared to the prior year.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses decreased from the prior year by $17,820. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of overall lower sales volume-driven expenses, as well as lower variable and deferred compensation expense incurred in fiscal 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year.
Operating expenses for the Fishing segment decreased by $9,160 from fiscal 2021 levels. The decrease was due primarily to lower sales volume related expenses between years.
Camping operating expenses increased by $2,467 from the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume related expenses and increased people costs.
In the Watercraft Recreation segment, operating expenses increased $475 from their levels in fiscal 2021 due primarily to increased sales volume related expenses in 2022.
Operating expenses for the Diving business increased by $993 year over year due primarily to increased sales volume related expenses between periods.
The Company's fiscal 2022 general corporate expenses of $23,722 decreased $12,595 from $36,317 in fiscal 2021. The year over year decrease reflects lower people costs, including $11,200 of lower deferred compensation expenses, as well as lower incentive compensation and lower health insurance costs from the prior year.
Operating Results
The Company’s operating profit was $66,310 in fiscal 2022 compared to an operating profit of $111,283 in fiscal 2021. Fishing operating profit decreased by $57,057 to $65,433 from $122,490 in the prior year due primarily to higher costs of goods and also lower sales volumes between years, stemming from supply chain disruptions, which were particularly acute in electronics. The operating profit for Camping was $13,415 compared to $14,025 in 2021 which decrease was primarily a result of the higher operating expenses between periods. The operating profit for the Watercraft Recreation business was $6,173 in fiscal 2022 compared to $9,173 in fiscal 2021 due to the factors noted above on changes in sales volumes and operating
expenses. Operating profit for the Diving business increased by $3,175 in fiscal 2022 from fiscal 2021, due primarily to increased sales volumes and pricing actions.
Other Income and Expenses
Interest expense of $153 was relatively flat as compared to the prior year expense of $145. Interest income of $807 increased from prior year interest income of $366 due to the increase in deposit interest rates year over year. Net other expense of $8,076 in fiscal 2022 decreased from net other income of $1,418 in fiscal 2021. The current year net other expense included currency losses of $1,741 and market losses net of dividend income of $5,878 on deferred compensation plan assets. In the prior year, net other income included $5,329 of market gains and dividends on the deferred compensation plan assets, partially offset by $215 of currency losses and pension termination expense of $2,526. The dividends and market gains and losses on deferred compensation plan assets recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in “Other expense (income), net” are offset as compensation expense in “Operating expenses.”
Pretax Income and Income Taxes
The Company realized pretax income of $58,888 in fiscal 2022 compared to $112,922 in fiscal 2021. The Company recorded income tax expense of $14,397 in 2022, which equated to an effective tax rate of 24.4%, compared to $29,541 in 2021, which equated to an effective tax rate of 26.2%.
Net Income
The Company recognized net income of $44,491, or $4.37 per diluted common share, in fiscal 2022 compared to $83,381, or $8.21 per diluted common share, in fiscal 2021 based on the factors discussed above.
Fiscal 2021 vs. Fiscal 2020
Net Sales
Net sales in 2021 increased by 26% to $751,651 compared to $594,209 in 2020. Foreign currency exchange had a favorable impact of less than 1%, on the fiscal 2021 sales versus the prior year.
Net sales for the Fishing business increased by $103,122, or 23% during 2021 from 2020. The increase over fiscal 2020 was driven by continued new product success and increased participation in fishing, principally as a result of the effect of COVID-19 on consumer recreation and leisure choices, resulting in higher demand across all product lines in this segment.
Camping net sales increased $21,329, or 51%, in 2021 from 2020. Increased sales of consumer tents and Jetboil products as a result of increased participation in outdoor recreation activities were the primary driver of the increase year over year.
Net sales in the Watercraft Recreation business increased $24,746, or 59% from 2020 to 2021. Increased demand as a result of increased participation in watercraft recreation activities during the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with new product success, drove the overall increase between years.
Diving net sales increased $8,574, or 14%, year over year. Fiscal 2020 sales were negatively impacted due to the effects of COVID-19 on demand globally due to restrictions in destination travel and tourism. As travel restrictions started to lift throughout fiscal 2021, tourism began to recover, resulting in increased demand and sales in this segment between years. In addition, foreign currency translation favorably impacted sales by approximately 3.3% in 2021 versus 2020.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales was $417,526, or 55.5% of net sales, on a consolidated basis for fiscal 2021 compared to $329,216, or 55.4% of net sales, in fiscal 2020. Higher sales volumes between years were the primary driver of the increase in the cost of sales between periods. Favorable product mix and pricing between fiscal years offset the impact of approximately $7,200 of additional tariffs on Chinese goods and components during fiscal 2021, as well as increased freight costs over fiscal 2020.
Gross Profit
Gross profit of $334,125 was 44.5% of net sales on a consolidated basis for the year ended October 1, 2021 compared to $264,993, or 44.6% of net sales in fiscal 2020.
Gross profit in the Fishing business in fiscal 2021 increased by $39,676 from fiscal 2020 due primarily to the 23% increase in net sales year over year. Favorable product mix and improved absorption of overhead costs during fiscal 2021 partially offset approximately $5,900 of additional tariff costs on Chinese sourced goods and components and higher freight costs incurred during fiscal 2021 versus fiscal 2020.
Camping gross profit increased by $11,497 from 2020 due primarily to increased sales volumes, pricing actions and a favorable mix of products sold in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020.
Gross profit in the Watercraft Recreation segment increased by $12,289 from fiscal 2020 due primarily to increased sales volumes in fiscal 2021 versus the prior year and the resulting improvement in absorption of overhead costs.
The $5,463 increase in gross profit in the Diving segment was due primarily to increased sales volumes, pricing actions and favorable product mix during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses increased in fiscal 2021 from fiscal 2020 by $28,919. The increase was driven primarily by higher sales volume related costs incurred in fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year. Additionally, increased headcount and compensation costs further increased expenses year over year.
Operating expenses for the Fishing segment increased by $13,069 from fiscal 2020 levels. The increase was due primarily to higher sales volume related expenses, as well as increased people costs between years.
Camping operating expenses increased by $1,879 in fiscal 2021 from the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume related expenses.
In the Watercraft Recreation segment, operating expenses increased $2,787 in fiscal 2021 from their levels in fiscal 2020 due primarily to increased sales volume related expenses in 2021, partially offset by decreased spending rate on advertising and promotions.
Operating expenses for the Diving business increased by $1,357 year over year due primarily to increased sales volume related expenses, as well as increased people costs between periods.
The Company's 2021 general corporate expenses of $36,317 increased $9,827 from $26,490 in 2020. The year over year increase reflects higher people costs including $2,900 of higher deferred compensation expenses and higher health insurance costs over the prior year as well as higher professional services expense.
Operating Results
The Company’s operating profit was $111,283 in fiscal 2021 compared to an operating profit of $71,070 in fiscal 2020. Fishing operating profit increased by $26,606 to $122,490 from $95,884 in the prior year due primarily to higher sales volumes between years. The operating profit for Camping was $14,025 compared to $4,406 in 2020 which increase was also primarily a result of higher sales volumes between periods. The operating profit for the Watercraft Recreation business was $9,173 in fiscal 2021 compared to a loss of $329 in fiscal 2020 due to the factors noted above on changes in sales volumes and operating expenses. Operating profit for the Diving business increased by $4,106 in fiscal 2021 from fiscal 2020, due to recovery from the impact of COVID-19 and demand for our Diving products and the other factors discussed above.
Other Income and Expenses
Interest expense in fiscal 2021 of $145 was relatively flat as compared to the prior year expense of $143. Interest income of $366 decreased from fiscal 2020 year interest income of $1,413 due to the decrease in deposit interest rates year over year. Net other income of $1,418 in fiscal 2021 increased slightly from net other income of $1,362 in fiscal 2020. Fiscal 2021 net other income included currency losses of $215 and market gains and dividends of $5,329 on deferred compensation plan assets, partially offset by pension termination expense of $2,526. In fiscal 2020, net other income included $269 of currency losses and $2,454 of market gains and dividends on the deferred compensation plan assets. The dividends and market gains and losses on deferred compensation plan assets recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in “Other income, net” are offset as compensation expense in “Operating expenses.”
Pretax Income and Income Taxes
The Company realized pretax income of $112,922 in fiscal 2021 compared to $73,702 in fiscal 2020. The Company recorded income tax expense of $29,541 in fiscal 2021, which equated to an effective tax rate of 26.2%, compared to $18,469 in fiscal 2020, which equated to an effective tax rate of 25.1%.
Net Income
The Company recognized net income of $83,381, or $8.21 per diluted common share, in fiscal 2021 compared to $55,233, or $5.47 per diluted common share, in fiscal 2020 based on the factors discussed above.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company believes its existing balances of cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchase requirements, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next twelve months. The Company currently anticipates the cash used for future dividends will come from its current cash and cash generated from ongoing operating activities.
The Company considers all short-term investments in interest-bearing bank accounts, and all securities and other instruments with an original maturity of three months or less, to be equivalent to cash. Short-term investments in prior years consisted of certificates of deposit, with original maturities greater than three months but less than one year, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade.
The Company’s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, are summarized in the following table:
Operating Activities
The following table sets forth the Company’s working capital position at the end of each of the years shown:
Cash flows used for operations in fiscal 2022 totaled $62,144, and cash provided by operations totaled $58,318 and $61,493 in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. The change in operating cash flow from the prior year is due primarily to a decrease in net income, as well as increases in inventory levels and other working capital changes.
Depreciation and amortization charges were $14,234, $13,401 and $14,926 in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Investing Activities
Cash flows used for investing activities were $31,678, $21,381, and $15,587 in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. There were no sales or purchases of short-term investments in fiscal 2022, 2021 or 2020. Expenditures for property, plant and equipment were $31,690, $21,409 and $15,600 in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase from the prior year is due primarily to additional capacity investments made in the current year. In general, the Company’s ongoing capital expenditures are primarily related to tooling for new products, facilities investments and information systems improvements.
Financing Activities
Cash flows used for financing activities totaled $12,233 in fiscal 2022 compared to $9,033 and $7,107 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and were primarily for the payment of dividends of $12,056 and $8,400 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. In 2020, dividend payments totaled $6,773.
Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company has contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments under its operating leases and open purchase orders. There have been no changes outside of the ordinary course of business in the specified contractual obligations during the year ended September 30, 2022.
The Company utilizes letters of credit primarily as security for the payment of future claims under its workers’ compensation insurance. Letters of credit outstanding at September 30, 2022 and October 1, 2021 were $173 and $181, respectively, and were included in the Company’s total loan availability. The Company had no unsecured revolving credit facilities at its foreign subsidiaries as of September 30, 2022 or October 1, 2021.
The Company has no other off-balance sheet arrangements.
Market Risk Management
Coronavirus outbreak
As disclosed in our prior filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and elsewhere herein, in December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus ("COVID-19"), began to spread globally, leaving no region or part of the world unaffected by the pandemic it has created. Governments and health authorities took measures to prevent the spread of this virus (including in certain cases requiring or recommending a vaccine or imposing testing requirements), all of which impacted the Company's business and operations. To the extent that COVID-19 continues to persist or recur, among other things, the ability of the Company’s suppliers to manufacture and deliver the products that it sells to the Company, the ability of the Company to manufacture and deliver its products to its customers, the Company's ability to display its products at trade shows and similar events, the Company's ability to conduct meetings with its customers and prospective customers, and, if a significant number of its employees at a particular facility or location were to contract coronavirus, the Company’s ability to conduct its day-to-day operations could be adversely impacted. The financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the Company will depend on future developments, including related to any supply chain disruptions, that the Company cannot reasonably predict or estimate at this time, but any of which could materially and adversely affect its results for an unknown but possibly extended period. See the section "Risk Factors" identified in Part I, Item 1A in this Form 10-K for more information.
Foreign Exchange Risk
The Company has significant foreign operations, for which the functional currencies are denominated primarily in euros, Swiss francs, Hong Kong dollars and Canadian dollars. As the values of the currencies of the foreign countries in which the Company has operations increase or decrease relative to the U.S. dollar, the sales, expenses, profits, losses, assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign operations, as reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, increase or decrease, accordingly. Approximately 13% of the Company’s revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Approximately 4% were denominated in euros and approximately 6% were denominated in Canadian dollars, with the remaining 3% denominated in various other foreign currencies. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can cause unexpected financial losses or cash flow needs.
Interest Rate Risk
The Company operates in a seasonal business and experiences significant fluctuations in operating cash flow as working capital needs increase in advance of the Company’s primary selling and cash generation season, and decline as accounts receivable are collected and cash is accumulated.
Commodities
Certain components used in the Company’s products are exposed to commodity price changes. The Company manages this risk through instruments such as purchase orders and non-cancellable supply contracts. Primary commodity price exposures include costs associated with metals, resins and packaging materials.
Impact of Inflation
The Company anticipates that changing costs of basic raw materials (including due to inflationary conditions in the economy) may impact future operating costs and, accordingly, the prices of its products. The Company is involved in continuing programs to mitigate the impact of cost increases through changes in product design and identification of sourcing and manufacturing efficiencies. Price increases and, in certain situations, price decreases are implemented for individual products, when appropriate.
The Company’s results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The Company’s management discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of its assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related footnote disclosures. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates for product returns, bad debts, inventories, long lived assets and goodwill, income taxes, warranty obligations, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, litigation and other subjective matters impacting the financial statements. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Management has discussed these policies with the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated by the individual operating companies based on estimates of losses related to customer accounts receivable balances. Estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses, adjusting for current economic conditions and, in some cases, evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss. The establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances. Though the Company considers these balances adequate and proper, changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which the Company operates and any specific customer collection issues the Company identifies could have a favorable or unfavorable effect on required reserve balances.
Inventories
The Company values inventory at the lower of cost (determined using the first-in first-out method) or net realizable value. Management’s judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory. Inventory on hand may exceed future demand either because the product is outdated or because the amount on hand is more than will be used to meet future needs. Inventory reserves are estimated by the individual operating companies using standard quantitative measures based on criteria established by the Company. The Company also considers current forecast plans, as well as market and industry conditions in establishing reserve levels. Though the Company considers these reserve balances to be adequate, changes in economic conditions, customer inventory levels or competitive conditions could have a favorable or unfavorable effect on required reserve balances.
Deferred Taxes
The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should the Company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Impairment
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. Generally, annual impairment tests are performed by the Company in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.
In assessing the recoverability of the Company’s goodwill, the Company estimates the fair value of the businesses to which the goodwill relates. Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value, no impairment exists. When fair value is less than the carrying value of the net assets and related goodwill, an impairment charge is recognized based on the excess of carrying amount over its fair value. The Company did not recognize any goodwill impairment charges in 2022, 2021 or 2020.
The discounted cash flow analysis used to estimate fair value requires a number of key estimates and assumptions. The Company estimates the future cash flows of the reporting units based on historical and forecasted revenues and operating costs and applies a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for purposes of the valuation. This discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital, which includes certain assumptions made by management such as market capital structure, market betas, the risk-free rate of return and the estimated costs of borrowing. Changes in these key estimates and assumptions, or in other assumptions used in this process, could materially affect our impairment analysis in a given year.
In assessing the recoverability of the Company’s other indefinite lived intangible assets, the Company estimates the fair value of the various intangible assets. The fair value of trademarks and patents is estimated using the relief from royalty method. If the fair value of an intangible asset exceeds its net book value, no impairment exists. When fair value is less than the carrying value of the intangible asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount of the difference.
A number of factors, many of which the Company has no ability to control, could affect its financial condition, operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions that the Company uses in preparing its financial statements. These factors include: a prolonged global economic crisis, a significant decrease in demand for the Company’s products, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator and successful efforts by the Company’s competitors to gain market share.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of
The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as unplanned negative cash flow indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If such assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Application of alternative assumptions, such as changes in the estimate of future cash flows, could produce significantly different results. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change.
Warranties
The Company accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services. Warranty reserves are estimated using standard quantitative measures based on criteria established by the Company. Estimates of costs to service its warranty obligations are based on historical experience, expectation of future conditions and known product issues. To the extent the Company experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, revisions to the estimated warranty reserve would be required. The Company engages in product quality programs and processes, including monitoring and evaluating the quality of its suppliers, to help minimize warranty obligations.
