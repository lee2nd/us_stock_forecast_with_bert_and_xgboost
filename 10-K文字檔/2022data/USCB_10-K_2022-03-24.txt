Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes
financial information determined by methods
other than in accordance with
generally
accepted
accounting
principles
(“GAAP”).
This
financial
information
includes
certain
operating
performance
measures. Management has included these non-GAAP
measures because it believes these measures may
provide useful
supplemental information
for evaluating
the Company’s
underlying performance
trends. Further,
management uses
these
measures
in
managing
and
evaluating
the
Company’s
business
and
intends
to
refer
to
them
in
discussions
about
our
operations and performance.
Operating performance
measures should be
viewed in addition
to, and not
as an alternative
to or
substitute
for,
measures
determined
in
accordance
with
GAAP,
and
are
not
necessarily
comparable
to non-GAAP
measures
that
may
be
presented
by
other
companies.
To
the
extent
applicable,
reconciliations
of
these
non-GAAP
measures to the most directly
comparable GAAP measures can be found
in the ‘Non-GAAP Reconciliation Tables’ included
in this annual report.
Overview
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the
Company reported net income of $21.1
million compared with net income
of
$10.8 million
for the
year ended
December 31, 2020,
representing
a 94.8%
increase. The
results from
2021 included
closing our initial public offering of the Class A common stock and the simplification of the Bank’s capital structure.
In
evaluating
our
financial
performance,
we
consider
the
level
of
and
trends
in
net
interest
income,
the
net
interest
margin, the cost of deposits,
levels and composition of
non-interest income and non-interest
expense, performance ratios,
asset quality ratios, regulatory capital ratios, and any significant
event or transaction.
The following significant highlights are of note for the year
ended December 31, 2021:
•
Net interest
income
after
provision
for credit
losses totaled
$52.7
million, an
increase of
$12.3
million or
30.5%,
compared to $40.3 million at December 31, 2020.
•
Net interest
margin (“NIM”)
remained the
same at
3.26%
for the
years ended
December 31, 2021
and 2020.
The
yield on earning assets decreased to 3.52% in 2021, compared to 3.93% in 2020. The yield on earning assets was
negatively impacted by certain floating rate investment securities,
loans with variable rate pricing features, and
new
loans originated in the lower interest rate environment,
including PPP loans which carry a rate of 1.0%.
•
NIM, excluding PPP loans, was 3.16% and 3.30% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
•
Total assets grew to $1.9 billion, an increase of $352.2
million or 23.5%, compared to December 31, 2020.
•
Loans grew to $1.2 billion, an increase of $151.6 million
or 14.6%, compared to December 31, 2020.
•
The cost of interest-bearing liabilities
decreased
to 0.45%
in 2021 from 1.07% in
2020 as a result of the continued
downward repricing of deposits and continued improvement in
deposit mix.
•
Return on average assets for the year ended December
31, 2021 was 1.24% compared to 0.76% in 2020.
•
Return on average stockholders’ equity for the year ended December 31, 2021 was
11.45% compared to 6.54% in
2020.
•
Nonperforming
assets
totaled
$1.2
million,
a
decrease
of
$0.4
million
or
24.6%,
compared
to
$1.6
million
at
December 31, 2020.
•
The Company maintained its strong capital position. As of December 31, 2021, the Bank was well-capitalized, with
a total risk-based capital ratio of 14.92%,
a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of
13.70%, a common equity tier 1 capital
ratio of
13.70%,
and a
leverage ratio
of 9.55%.
As of
December 31, 2021
and 2020,
all of
our regulatory
capital
ratios exceeded the thresholds to be well-capitalized under
the applicable bank regulatory requirements.
•
In April 2021,
the Bank
repurchased
all of
its issued
and outstanding
Class E
preferred
shares at
the liquidation
value of $7.5
million along with
declared dividends approved
by the Board
of Directors (the
“Board”) with the
goal
to simplify its capital structure.
USCB Financial Holdings, Inc.
2021 10-K
•
In July
2021, the
Bank completed
the initial
public offering
of 4,600,000
shares of
Class A common
stock, which
included an additional 600,000 shares in connection with the exercise in full of the underwriters’
option to purchase
additional shares. In a continuation effort to simplify the Company’s capital structure, an exchange and redemption
of then outstanding Class C and Class D preferred shares
was also completed.
•
In December 2021,
the Bank
entered into agreements
with the Class
B shareholders
to exchange all
outstanding
Class B non-voting common stock for Class A voting common
stock.
•
The Company became the parent bank
holding company of the Bank effective
December 28, 2021. Each share of
the
Bank
was
exchanged
for
one
share
of
the
Company,
making
the
Bank
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
the
Company. Shares
of the Company continue to trade under ticker symbol “USCB”
on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The
consolidated
financial
statements
are
prepared
based
on
the
application
of
U.S.
GAAP,
the
most
significant
of
which are described
in Note 1 “Summary
of Significant Accounting
Policies” to our
Consolidated Financial Statements.
To
prepare financial statements in conformity with GAAP,
management makes estimates, assumptions,
and judgments based
on
available
information.
These
estimates,
assumptions,
and
judgments
affect
the
amounts
reported
in
the
financial
statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on
information available as
of
the
date
of
the
financial
statements
and,
as
this
information
changes,
actual
results
could
differ
from
the
estimates,
assumptions
and
judgments
reflected
in
the
financial
statements.
In
particular,
management
has
identified
accounting
policies that, due to
the estimates, assumptions
and judgments inherent
in those policies, are
critical in understanding
our
financial statements.
Management
has presented
the application
of these
policies
to the
audit and
risk committee
of our
Board.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit
losses (“ACL”) is
a valuation allowance that
is established through charges
to earnings in the
form of
a provision for
credit losses. The
amount of the
ACL is
affected by the
following: (i) charge-offs of
loans that decrease
the allowance;
(ii) subsequent
recoveries on
loans previously
charged off
that increase
the allowance;
and (iii)
provisions
for credit losses charged to
income that increase the allowance.
Management considers the policies
related to the ACL as
the most critical to
the financial statement
presentation. The total
ACL includes activity
related to allowances
calculated in
accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 310,
Receivables, and ASC 450, Contingencies.
Throughout the year,
management estimates the probable
incurred losses in the loan portfolio
to determine if the ACL
is adequate to absorb such losses. The ACL
consists of specific and general components.
The specific component relates
to loans that are
individually classified as
impaired. We follow
a loan review program
to evaluate the credit
risk in the loan
portfolio. Loans
that have
been identified
as impaired
are reviewed
on a
quarterly basis
in order
to determine
whether a
specific reserve is
required. The general
component covers
non-impaired loans
and is based
on industry and
our specific
historical loan
loss experience,
volume, growth
and composition
of the
loan portfolio,
the evaluation
of our
loan portfolio
through our
internal
loan review
process, general
current
economic
conditions
both
internal and
external to
us that
may
affect the borrower’s ability to pay,
value of collateral and other qualitative relevant risk factors. Based on a review
of these
estimates, we
adjust the ACL
to a
level determined by
management to be
adequate. Estimates of
credit losses are
inherently
subjective as they involve an exercise of judgment.
The
CARES
Act,
as
amended
by
the
Consolidated
Appropriations
Act,
2021,
specified
that
COVID-19
related
loan
modifications executed
between March 1,
2020 and
the earlier
of (i)
60 days
after the
date of
termination
of the
national
emergency declared by President Trump and (ii) January 1, 2022, on loans
that were current as of December 31, 2019,
are
not TDRs. Additionally,
under guidance from the federal banking agencies,
other short-term modifications made on a good
faith basis
in response
to COVID-19
to borrowers
that were
current prior
to any
relief are
not TDRs
under ASC
Subtopic
310-40,
“Troubled
Debt
Restructurings
by
Creditors.”
These
modifications
include
short-term
(i.e.,
up
to
six
months)
modifications
such
as
payment
deferrals,
fee
waivers,
extensions
of
repayment
terms,
or
delays
in
payment
that
are
insignificant. The Company’s charge-off policy is to continuously
review all impaired loans to monitor the Company’s ability
to collect them in full at the applicable maturity date and/or in accordance
with terms of any restructurings. For loans which
are collateral dependent,
or deemed to
be uncollectible, any
shortfall in the
fair value of
the collateral relative to
the recorded
investment in the loan is charged off. The amount charged
-off conforms to the amount necessary
to comply with GAAP.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax
assets and
liabilities are
recognized for
the future
tax consequences
attributable to
differences
between
the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases and operating loss
USCB Financial Holdings, Inc.
2021 10-K
and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected
to apply to
taxable income
in the
years in
which those
temporary differences
are expected
to be
recovered or
settled. The
effect
on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date.
Management is required to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established on the net deferred tax assets
based on the
consideration of
all available evidence
using a more
likely than not
standard. In its
evaluation, management
considers taxable loss
carry-back availability, expectation of sufficient
taxable income, trends
in earnings, the
future reversal
of temporary differences, and available tax planning
strategies.
The Company recognizes positions taken
or expected to be
taken in a tax
return in accordance with existing accounting
guidance on
income taxes
which prescribes
a recognition threshold
and measurement
process. Interest
and penalties
on
tax liabilities, if any, would
be recorded in interest expense and other operating non-interest
expense, respectively.
Segment Reporting
Management monitors the revenue streams for all its various
products and services. The identifiable segments are not
material
and
operations
are
managed
and
financial
performance
is
evaluated
on
an
overall
Company-wide
basis.
Accordingly, all
the financial service
operations are
considered by management
to be
aggregated in one
reportable operating
segment.

and non-interest income.
Other factors
contributing
to
the
results
of
operations
include
our
provision
for
credit

Net income
for the
year ended
December 31, 2021
was $21.1 million
,
compared with
net income
of $10.8 million
for
the same period in 2020. The Company reported net loss per diluted
share for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $6.72
compared to net income per diluted share for the same period in 2020 of $1.50 and $0.30 for
Class A
and Class B common
stock, respectively, after adjusted to reflect the 1
for 5 reverse stock split on
Class A
common stock. The net loss per diluted
share for the year ended December 31, 2021 was attributable to the one-time reduction in net income available to common
stockholders for the
exchange and redemption
of the Class
C and Class D
preferred shares. During
third quarter of
2021,
USCB Financial Holdings, Inc.
2021 10-K
the
Company
completed
an
exchange
of
then
outstanding
preferred
shares
for
Class A
common
shares
and
thereafter
redeemed the remaining outstanding preferred shares, at a liquidation value that exceeded book value, causing a one-time
reduction in
net income
available to
common stockholders
of $89.6
million. At December 31,
2021, there
were no
issued
and outstanding preferred shares.
Operating net
income per
diluted share
(non-GAAP) for
the year
ended December 31,
2021 was
$1.81 compared
to
operating net income per
diluted share (non-GAAP)
for the same period
in 2020 of $1.50
and $0.30 for Class A and Class
B, respectively.
Operating net
income per
diluted share
(non-GAAP) for
the year
ended December 31,
2021 excludes
the
$89.6 million one-time accounting
impact of
the exchange
and redemption of
the preferred
shares. The
operating net
income
per diluted share
for the year
ended December 31,
2020 was adjusted
to reflect the
1 for 5
reverse stock
split on Class A
common stock.
To see
a reconciliation
of non-GAAP
measures to
GAAP measures
refer to
section below
“Reconciliation
and Management Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial
Measures”.
Net Interest Income
Net interest
income is
the difference
between interest
earned on interest
earning assets
and interest
incurred on
interest-
bearing liabilities
and is
the primary
driver of
core earnings.
Interest income
is generated
from interest
and dividends
on
interest-earning
assets,
including
loans,
investment
securities
and
other
short-term
investments.
Interest
expense
is
incurred
from
interest
paid
on
interest-bearing
liabilities,
including
interest-bearing
deposits,
FHLB
advances
and
other
borrowings.
To evaluate net
interest income, we
measure and monitor
(i) yields on
loans and other
interest-earning assets, (ii)
the
costs of deposits
and other funding
sources, (iii) net
interest spread, and
(iv) net interest margin.
Net interest spread is
equal
to the difference between rates
earned on interest-earning assets
and rates paid on interest-bearing
liabilities. Net interest
margin is
equal to
the annualized
net interest
income
divided by
average interest
-earning assets.
Because
non-interest-
bearing sources of funds, such as non-interest-bearing deposits
and stockholders’ equity, also fund interest-earning assets,
net interest margin includes the benefit of these non-interest-bearing
sources.
Changes in
the market
interest rates
and interest
rates we
earn on
interest-earning assets
or pay on
interest-bearing
liabilities, as well
as the volume
and types of
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
and non-interest-bearing liabilities,
are usually the
largest drivers
of periodic changes
in net interest
spread, net interest
margin and net
interest income.
Our
asset liability committee
(“ALCO”) has
in place asset-liability
management techniques
to manage major
factors that
affect
net interest income and net interest margin.

Net interest spread is the average yield on
total interest-earning assets minus the average
rate on total interest-bearing liabilities.
(4)
Net interest margin is the ratio of net interest
income to total interest-earning assets.
Net interest income before the provision
for credit losses was $52.5 million
for the year ended December
31, 2021, an
increase of
$8.9 million or
20.4%, from
$43.6 million for
the year
ended December
31, 2020.
This increase
was primarily
attributable to higher
income from investment
securities and loan
fees as well
as lower costs
for interest-bearing liabilities
because of lower interest rate benchmarks.
Included with loan interest income are PPP fees totaling $3.6 million and $2.3 million for the year ended December
31,
2021 and 2020, respectively.
PPP loan fees are recognized upon forgiveness.
The net
interest margin
remained the
same at
3.26% for
the years
ended December 31,
2021 and
2020. The
overall
and individual yields for interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing
liabilities both decreased in 2021 compared to 2020.
Provision for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses
(“ACL”) represents probable incurred
losses in our portfolio. We
maintain an adequate
ACL that can mitigate probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio. The ACL is increased by the provision for credit losses
and is decreased
by charge-offs,
net of recoveries
on prior
loan charge-offs.
There are multiple
credit quality
metrics that
we use
to
base our
determination
of
the
amount of
the ACL and
corresponding
provision
for credit
losses. These
credit
metrics evaluate
the credit
quality and
level of
credit risk
inherent in
our loan
portfolio, assess
non-performing
loans and
charge-offs levels, considers statistical trends and economic
conditions and other applicable factors.
Provision for
credit loss
for the
year ended
December 31,
2021, was
a net
reduction of
$160 thousand
compared to
$3.3 million in provision
expense for the same
period in 2020. The primary
driver of the decrease
was the improvement of
USCB Financial Holdings, Inc.
2021 10-K
the credit risk
associated with the
COVID-19 pandemic. The
ACL as
a percentage of
total loans was
1.27%
at December 31,
2021 compared to 1.45% at December 31, 2020.
See “Allowance for Credit Losses” below for further discussion
on how the ACL is calculated.
Non-Interest Income
Net interest income
and other types of
recurring non-interest
income are generated
from our operations.
Our services
and products generate service charges and fees, mainly from our depository accounts. We also
generate income from gain
on sale of
loans though
our swap and
SBA programs. In addition,
we own insurance
on several employees
and generate
income on the increase in the cash surrender value of
these policies.

Non-interest income
for the
year ended
December 31,
2021 increased
$4.6 million or
75.5%, compared
to the
same
period in 2020.
This increase was primarily
driven by the default
interest recovery of a
prior lending customer for $2.5
million
and a gain on the sale of a previously owned building for $983 thousand as well as higher deposit service fees and gain on
sales of loans due
to increased activity
in our SBA program. Further,
the default interest recovery
of $2.5 million was
for a
loan that was originated
in 2008 and subsequently
went through many iterations
of credit collection. This payment
reflects
the final payment and settlement of lien judgments against
the customer.

The increase
is primarily
due to
an increase
in salaries

of $2.2 million
for the
year ended
December 31, 2021,
compared to
the same
period in
2020. The

$0.4 million
or
7.6%,
respectively,
during
the
year

December 31,
2021 compared
to the
same
period
in
due
to our
operations
as a
publicly traded
company
and
the
formation of a bank holding company.
The increase in salaries and employee benefits, consulting and legal fees, and other
operating costs has enabled
us to support recent growth
and has provided us with
the necessary technology and required
professionals to execute our growth strategy.
Provision for Income Tax
Fluctuations in the effective tax rate reflect the effect of the differences in the inclusion or deductibility of certain income
and expenses for
income tax purposes.
Therefore, future
decisions on the
investments we choose
will affect our
effective

insurance policies for key employees, purchasing municipal bonds, and
overall
taxable income will be important elements in determining our
effective tax rate.

Investment Securities
The investment portfolio
is used and
managed to provide
liquidity through cash
flows, marketability
and, if necessary,
collateral for
borrowings. The
investment portfolio
is also
used as
a tool
to manage
interest rate
risk and
the Company’s
capital
market
risk
exposure.
The
philosophy
of
the
portfolio
is
to
maximize
the
Company’s
profitability
taking
into
consideration the Company’s risk appetite and tolerance, manage the assets composition
and diversification, and maintain
adequate risk-based capital ratios.
The
investment
portfolio
is
managed
in
accordance
with
the
Asset
and
Liability
Management
(“ALM”)
policy,
which
includes an
investment guideline,
approved by
the Board.
Such policy
is reviewed
at least
annually or
more frequently
if
deemed necessary,
depending on
market
conditions
and/or
unexpected
events.
The investment
portfolio
composition
is
USCB Financial Holdings, Inc.
2021 10-K
subject to change
depending on the
funding and liquidity
needs of
the Company, and the interest
risk management objective
directed by the ALCO. The portfolio of investments can be used to modify the duration of the balance
sheet. The allocation
of cash into
securities takes
into consideration
anticipated future cash
flows (uses
and sources) and
all available sources
of credit.
Our
investment
portfolio
consists
primarily
of
securities
issued
by
U.S.
government-sponsored
agencies,
agency
mortgage-backed securities,
collateralized mortgage
obligation securities,
municipal securities,
and other
debt securities,
all with varying contractual maturities and coupons. Due to the optionality embedded in these securities, the final maturities
do not
necessarily represent the
expected life of
the portfolio. Some
of these
securities will be
called or paid
down depending
on capital market conditions and expectations. The investment portfolio is regularly reviewed by the Chief Financial Officer,
Treasurer,
or
ALCO
of
the
Company
to
ensure
an
appropriate
risk
and
return
profile
as
well
as
for
adherence
to
the
investment policy.
As of December 31, 2021, the investment portfolio consisted of available-for-sale
(“AFS”) and held-to-maturity (“HTM”)
debt securities.
During the third quarter
of 2021, there were
28 investment securities that
were transferred from AFS
to HTM
with an amortized cost basis and fair value amount
of $67.6 million and $68.7 million, respectively.
On the date of transfer,
these securities had a
total net unrealized gain of
$1.1 million. The transfer of debt
securities from the AFS
to HTM category
were made at fair value at the date of
transfer. The unrealized gain or loss at the date of transfer is retained in accumulated
other
comprehensive
income
and
in
the
carrying
value
of
the
HTM
securities.
Such
amounts
are
amortized
over
the
remaining life of the security.
There was no impact to net income on the date of transfer.
The book value of the AFS securities is adjusted monthly
for unrealized gain or loss as a valuation allowance,
and any
gain
or
loss
is
reported
on
an
after-tax
basis
as
a
component
of
other
comprehensive
income
in
stockholders’
equity.
Periodically,
we
may
need
to
assess
whether
there
have
been
any
events
or
unexpected
economic
circumstances
to
indicate that
a security
on which
there is
an unrealized
loss is
impaired on
an other-than-temporary
basis (“OTTI”).
If the
impairment is
deemed to
be permanent,
an analysis
would be
made considering
many factors,
including the
severity and
duration of the impairment, the severity
of the event, our intent and
ability to hold the security for a
period of time sufficient
for a
recovery in
value, recent
events specific
to the
issuer or
industry,
any related
credit events,
and for
debt securities,
external
credit
ratings
and
recent
downgrades
related
to
deterioration
of
credit
quality.
Securities
on
which
there
is
an
unrealized loss
that is
deemed to
be OTTI
are written
down to
fair value,
with the
write-down recorded
as a
realized loss
under line item
“Gain (loss) on
sale of securities
available-for-sale,
net” of the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.
As
of December
31,
2021, there
are no
securities
which
management
has
classified
as
OTTI.
For
further discussion
of our
analysis
on
impaired
investment
securities
for
OTTI,

Note 2
“Investment
Securities”
to

Consolidated
Financial
Statements in this Form 10-K.
AFS and
HTM investment
securities increased
$189.9 million or
56.8% to
$524.2 million at
December 31,
2021 from
$334.3 million at December 31, 2020. Investment securities increased over the past year due to higher than expected cash
balances.
Management
reinvested

according
to
the
ALM
policy.
As
of
December 31,
2021,
corporate bond securities with a market value of $20.4 million were pledged to secure

Loans
Loans are
the largest
category of
interest-earning assets
on the
Consolidated
Balance Sheets,
and usually
provides
higher yields
than the
rest of
the interest-earning
assets. Higher
yields typically
carry inherent
credit and
liquidity risks
in
comparison to lower yield assets.
The Company manages and mitigates
such risks in accordance with the
credit and ALM
policies, risk tolerance and balance sheet composition.

Total
gross loans increased
by $150.6 million
or 14.5%
at December 31,
2021 compared to
the same period
in 2020.
The most
significant growth
was in
the commercial
real estate
and consumer
and other
loan pools,
offset by
a decline
in
the residential real
estate and commercial
and industrial loan
pools. Consumer and
other loans increased
because of two
yacht loan portfolios that were purchased for $93.7 million,
including deferred fees, for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Commercial and industrial loans decreased because of
continuing PPP loan forgiveness
as expected.
The loan portfolio has continued to experience growth in the past two years. Since our inception, the primary focus has
been
on
commercial
real
estate
lending,
representing
approximately
59.2%
of
the
total
gross
loan
portfolio
as
of
December 31, 2021. In the past, we supplemented our core commercial growth with the origination of 1-4 family residential
loans and
the acquisition
of 1-4
family residential
loan portfolios
to further
diversify our
loan portfolio.
However,
we have
determined not to further pursue this line of business and
are focused on growing our commercial portfolio.
Other than the previous
mentioned shifts, we
do not expect any
significant changes
over the foreseeable future
in the
composition
of
our
loan
portfolio
or
in
our
emphasis
on
commercial
real
estate
lending.
Our
loan
growth
strategy
since
inception has been reflective of the market in which we
operate and of our strategic plan as approved by the
Board.
Most of the
commercial real estate
exposure represents
loans to commercial
businesses secured
by owner-occupied
real estate.
The growth
experienced
over the
last couple
of years
is primarily
due to
implementation
of our
relationship-
based banking model and the success
of our relationship managers in
competing for new business in
a highly competitive
metropolitan area. Many of our
larger loan clients have lengthy
relationships with members of our senior management
team
or our relationship managers that date back to former institutions.
From a
liquidity perspective,
our loan
portfolio provides
us with
additional
liquidity due
to repayments
or unexpected
prepayments.

The information
presented
in the
table above
is based
upon the
contractual
maturities of
the individual
loans, which
may be
subject to
renewal at
their contractual
maturity.
Renewals will
depend on
approval by
our credit
department and
balance sheet
composition at the
time of
the analysis,
as well
as any
modification of terms
at the
loan’s maturity. Additionally,
USCB Financial Holdings, Inc.

maturity
concentrations,
loan
duration,
prepayment
speeds
and
other
interest
rate
sensitivity
measures
are
discussed,
reviewed, and analyzed by the ALCO. Decisions on term
rate modifications are discussed as well.
As of
December 31,
2021, approximately
60.7%
of the
loans
have adjustable/variable
rates
and
39.3%
of the
loans
have fixed rates.
The adjustable/variable
loans re-price to
different benchmarks
and tenors in
different periods
of time. By
contractual characteristics, there are no
material concentrations on anniversary repricing. Additionally, it is
important to note
that most
of our
loans have
interest rate
floors. This
embedded option
protects the
Company from
a decrease
in interest
rates and positions us to gain in the scenario of higher interest
rates.
Asset Quality
Our asset quality grading
analysis estimates the capability of
the borrower to repay
the contractual obligation of
the loan
agreement as scheduled or at all. The Company’s internal credit risk grading system is based on experiences with similarly
graded loans. Internal
credit risk
grades are evaluated
at least annually,
or more frequently
if deemed necessary.
Internal
credit
risk
ratings
may
change
based
on
management’s
assessment
of
the
results
from
the
annual
review,
portfolio
monitoring and other developments observed with borrowers.
The internal credit risk grades used by the Company to
assess the credit worthiness of a loan are shown below:
Pass
- Loans indicate different levels of satisfactory
financial condition and performance.
Special Mention
- Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness
that deserves management’s
close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses
may result in deterioration of the repayment
prospects for the loan or of the institution’s
credit position at some future date.
Substandard
- Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected
by the current net worth and paying
capacity of the obligator or of the collateral pledged, if
any. Loans so classified
have a well-defined weakness or
weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.
They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the
institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are
not corrected.
Doubtful
- Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent
in those classified at substandard, with
the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection
or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing
facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.
Loss
- Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible.
Loan credit exposures by internally assigned grades are

Non-performing
assets include
all loans
categorized as
non-accrual or
restructured,
impaired securities,
non-accrual
TDRs, other
real estate owned
(“OREO”) and other
repossessed assets. Problem
loans for
which the
collection or liquidation
in
full
is
reasonably
uncertain
are
placed
on
a
non-accrual
status.
This
determination
is
based
on
current
existing
facts
concerning collateral values
and the paying capacity
of the borrower.
When the collection of
the full contractual balance
is
unlikely, the loan is
placed on non-accrual to avoid overstating the Company’s
income for a loan with increased credit risk.
If the
principal or
interest on
a commercial
loan becomes
due and
unpaid for
90 days
or more,
the loan
is placed
on
non-accrual status as of
the date it becomes
90 days past due
and remains in non-accrual
status until it meets
the criteria
for restoration to accrual status.
Residential loans, on
the other hand, are placed
on non-accrual status when
the principal
or interest
becomes due
and unpaid
for 120
days or
more and remains
in non-accrual
status until
it meets
the criteria
for
restoration
to
accrual
status.
Restoring
a
loan
to
accrual
status
is
possible
when
the
borrower
resumes
payment
of
all
principal and interest
payments for a period
of six months
and the Company
has a documented
expectation of repayment
of the remaining contractual principal and interest or the
loan becomes secured and in the process of collection.
A TDR is
a debtor that
is experiencing
financial difficulties
and the Company
grants a concession.
This determination
is performed during the annual review process or whenever problems
are surfacing regarding the client’s ability to repay
in
accordance with
the original
terms of
the loan
or line
of credit.
In general,
a borrower
that can
obtain funds
from sources
other than
the Company
at market
interest rates
at or
near those
for non-troubled
debt is
not involved
in a
troubled debt
restructuring.
The
concessions
are
given
to
the
debtor
in
various
forms,
including
interest
rate
reductions,
principal
forgiveness,
extension
of
maturity
date,
waiver,
or
deferral
of
payments
and
other
concessions
intended
to
minimize
potential losses.

Allowance for Credit Losses
In
determining
the
balance
of
the
allowance
account,
loans
are
pooled
by
product
segments
with
similar
risk
characteristics and management
evaluates the ACL on
each segment and on
a regular basis to maintain
the allowance at
an
adequate
level
based
on
factors
which,
in
management’s
judgment,
deserve
current
recognition
in
estimating
credit
losses.
Such
factors
include
changes
in
prevailing
economic
conditions,
historical
loss
experience,
delinquency
trends,
changes in the composition and size of the loan portfolio
and the overall credit worthiness of the borrowers.
Additionally,
qualitative adjustments
are made to
the ACL when,
based on management’s
judgment, there are
factors
impacting the allowance estimate not considered by the
quantitative calculations.

We
have
also
established
Fed
Funds
lines
of
credit
with
our
upstream
correspondent
banks
to
manage
temporary
fluctuations in our daily cash balances. As of
December 31, 2021, there were no
outstanding balances with the Fed Funds
line of credit.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We engage
in various financial
transactions in
our operations
that, under GAAP,
may not be
included on
the balance
sheet. To
meet the financing needs
of our customers we may
include commitments to extend
credit and standby letters
of
credit. To
a varying
degree, such
commitments involve
elements of
credit, market,
and interest
rate risk
in excess
of the
amount recognized
in the
balance sheet.
We use
more conservative
credit and
collateral policies
in making
these credit
commitments as we
do for on-balance sheet
items. We are not
aware of any accounting
loss to be
incurred by funding
these
commitments; however,
we maintain an allowance
for off-balance sheet
credit risk which is
recorded under other liabilities
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Since commitments associated with letters of
credit and commitments to extend
credit may expire unused, the
amounts
shown do not necessarily
reflect the actual
future cash funding requirements
.

commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend funds to a client, as long as there is no violation of any condition
established
in
the
contract,
for
a
specific
purpose.
Commitments
generally
have
variable
interest
rates,
fixed
expiration
dates or
other
termination
clauses
and
may require
payment
of
a fee.
Since many
of the
commitments
are
expected to
expire without being
fully drawn, the
total commitment
amounts disclosed
above do not
necessarily represent
future cash
requirements.
Unfunded lines of credit represent unused portions of credit facilities to our current borrowers that represent no change
in credit risk in our portfolio. Lines
of credit generally have variable interest
rates. The maximum potential amount
of future
payments we could
be required to
make is represented
by the contractual
amount of the
commitment, less
the amount of
any advances made.
Letters of credit are
conditional commitments issued
by us to guarantee
the performance of a
client to a third
party.
In
the event of nonperformance by
the client in accordance with the
terms of the agreement with the
third party,
we would be
required to fund
the commitment.
If the commitment
is funded, we
would be entitled
to seek recovery
from the client
from
the underlying collateral,
which can include
commercial real estate,
physical plant and
property, inventory, receivables, cash
or marketable securities.
Asset and Liability Management Committee
The asset and liability management committee of our Company, or ALCO, consists of members of senior management
and our Board. Senior management is responsible for
ensuring in a timely manner that Board
approved strategies, policies,
and procedures
for managing
and mitigating
risks are
appropriately executed
within the
designated lines
of authority
and
responsibility.
ALCO
oversees
the
establishment,
approval,
implementation,
and
review
of
interest
rate
risk,
management,
and
mitigation strategies, ALM related policies, ALCO procedures
and risk tolerances and appetite.
While some
degree of
IRR (“Internal
Rate of
Return”) is
inherent to
the banking
business, our
ALCO has
established
sound risk management practices in place to identify,
measure, monitor and mitigate IRR exposures.
When assessing
the scope
of IRR
exposure
and
impact on
the consolidated
balance sheet,
cash
flows and
income
statement,
management
considers
both
earnings
and
economic
impacts.
Asset
price
variations,
deposits
volatility
and
reduced earnings or outright losses could adversely affect
the Company’s
liquidity, performance,
and capital adequacy.
Income simulations
are used
to assess
the impact
of changing
rates on
earnings under
different rates
scenarios and
time horizons.
These simulations
utilize both
instantaneous
and parallel
changes in
the level
of interest
rates, as
well as
non-parallel changes such as changing slopes (flat and steeping) and
twists of the yield curve, Static simulation models are
based on current exposures and
assume a constant balance sheet with

utilized to have a
more comprehensive assessment
on IRR. This simulation
relies on detailed
assumptions outlined in
our
budget and strategic plan, and in assumptions regarding changes in
existing lines of business, new business, management
strategies and client expected behavior.
To
have
a
more
complete
picture
of
IRR,
the
Company
also
evaluates
the
economic
value
of
equity,
or
EVE.
This
assessment
will
allow
us
to
measure
the
degree
to
which
the
economic
values
will
change
under
different
interest
rate
scenarios (parallel and non-parallel). The economic-value approach focuses on a longer-term time horizon and
captures all
future cash flows expected
from existing assets and
liabilities. The economic
value model utilizes a
static approach in that
the analysis
does not
incorporate new
business; rather,
the analysis
shows a
snapshot in
time of
the risk
inherent in
the
balance sheet.
Market and Interest Rate Risk Management
According to our ALCO model, as of December 31, 2021,
we were an asset sensitive company. This indicates that our
assets generally
reprice faster
than our
liabilities, which
results in
a favorable
impact to
net interest
income when
market
interest rates
increase. Many
assumptions are
used to
calculate the
impact of
interest rate
variations
on our
net interest
income, such as
asset prepayment speeds,
non-maturity deposit
price sensitivity,
pricing correlations, deposit
truncations
and decay rates, and key rate drivers.
Because of the inherent use
of these estimates and
assumptions in the model,
our actual results may,
and most likely
will, differ from static measures results. In addition, static measures like
EVEs do not include actions that management may
undertake to manage the risks in response to anticipated changes in interest rates or client deposit behavior. As part of our
ALM strategy
and
policy,
management
has the
ability
to modify
the
balance sheet
to
either increase
asset
duration
and
decrease liability
duration to reduce
asset sensitivity,
or to decrease
asset duration and
increase liability duration
in order
to increase asset sensitivity.
According to our model, as of December 31, 2021, the NIM will remain fairly stable for static rate scenarios (-400
basis
points:
+400
basis
points).
For
the
static
forecast
for
year
one,
the
estimated
NIM
will
decrease
from
3.09%
base
case
scenario to 3.08%
under a +400-basis
points scenario. Additionally, utilizing an economic
value of equity, or EVE,
approach,
we analyze the
risk to capital
from the
effects of
various interest
rate scenarios
through a long-term
discounted cash
flow
model. This
measures the
difference between
the economic
value of
our assets
and the
economic value
of our
liabilities,
which is
a proxy for
our liquidation value.
According to
our balance sheet
composition, and as
expected, our model
stipulates
that an increase of rates
will have a negative impact
on the EVE. Results and
analysis are presented quarterly to the
Board,
and strategies are defined.
Additionally, in the last couple of quarters we
have been reducing our asset
sensitivity by extending asset duration.
This
has reduced our NII volatility
for the first and second
year and has helped us
to maintain the NII in
accordance with ALCO
expectations.
Liquidity
Liquidity is
defined as
a Company’s capacity
to meet
its cash
and collateral
obligations at
a reasonable
cost. Maintaining
an adequate level of liquidity depends on the Company’s ability to
efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash flow
and collateral needs without adversely affecting
either daily operations or the financial condition of the
Company.
Liquidity risk
is the
risk that
we will
be unable
to meet
our short-term
and long-term
obligations as
they become
due
because of an inability
to liquidate assets or
obtain relatively adequate funding. The
Company’s obligations, and the funding
sources
used
to
meet
them,
depend
significantly
on
our
business
mix,
balance
sheet
structure
and
composition,
credit
quality of our assets and the cash flow profiles of our on-
and off-balance sheet obligations.
In managing
inflows and
outflows,
management
regularly
monitors situations
that can
give rise
to increased
liquidity
risk. These
include funding
mismatches, market
constraints on
the ability
to convert
assets (particularly
investments) into
cash or in accessing sources of funds (i.e., market liquidity),
and contingent liquidity events.
Changes in macroeconomic conditions or exposure
to credit, market, operational, legal
and reputational risks, including
cybersecurity risk could also affect the Company’s
liquidity risk profile unexpectedly and are considered
in the assessment
of liquidity and ALM framework.
Management has established
a comprehensive and
holistic management process for
identifying, measuring, monitoring
and
mitigating
liquidity
risk.
Due
to
its
critical
importance
to
the
viability
of
the
Company,
liquidity
risk
management
is
integrated into our risk management processes and ALM
policy.
USCB Financial Holdings, Inc.

Critical elements of our liquidity
risk management include: effective corporate governance consisting of
oversight by the
Board and
active involvement
by senior
management; appropriate strategies,
policies, procedures, and
limits used
to identify
and mitigate liquidity risk; comprehensive liquidity risk measurement and
monitoring systems (including assessments of the
current and prospective cash flows or sources and uses of funds) that are commensurate with the complexity and
business
activities of
the Company;
active management
of intraday
liquidity and
collateral; an
appropriately diverse
mix of
existing
and
potential
future
funding
sources;
adequate
levels
of
highly
liquid
marketable
securities
free
of
legal,
regulatory,
or
operational
impediments,
that
can
be
used
to
meet
liquidity
needs
in
stressful
situations;
comprehensive
contingency
funding plans
that sufficiently address
potential adverse liquidity
events and emergency
cash flow
requirements; and internal
controls
and
internal
audit
processes
sufficient
to
determine
the
adequacy
of
the
institution’s
liquidity
risk
management
process.
We
expect
funds
to
be
available
from
several
basic
banking
activity
sources,
including
the
core
deposit
base,
the
repayment and maturity of loans and investment security
cash flows. Other potential funding sources include
federal funds
purchased, brokered
certificates of
deposit, listing
certificates of
deposit, Fed
funds lines
and borrowings
from the
FHLB.
Accordingly, our liquidity resources
were at sufficient levels to fund loans and meet other cash needs as necessary.
We do
not expect liquidity resources to be compromised at this
time.

Impact of Inflation
Our Consolidated
Financial Statements
and related
notes have been
prepared in
accordance with
U.S. GAAP,
which
require the
measurement
of financial
position and
operating results
in terms
of historical
dollars,
without considering
the
changes
in
the
relative
purchasing
power
of
money
over
time due
to
inflation.
The
impact
of
inflation
is
reflected
in
the
increased cost of operations.
Unlike most industrial companies,
nearly all our assets and
liabilities are monetary in
nature.
As a result,
interest rates have a
greater impact on our
performance than do the
effects of general levels
of inflation. Periods
of high inflation
are often accompanied
by relatively higher
interest rates, and
periods of low
inflation are accompanied
by
relatively lower interest rates.
As market interest rates
rise or fall in relation
to the rates earned
on loans and investments,
the
value
of
these
assets
decreases
or
increases
respectively.
Inflation
can
also
impact
core
non-interest
expenses
associated with delivering the Company’s services.
