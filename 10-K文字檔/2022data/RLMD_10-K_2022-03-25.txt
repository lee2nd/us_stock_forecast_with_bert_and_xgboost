Our Corporate History and Background
Relmada Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage, publicly traded biotechnology company developing NCEs that potentially address areas of high unmet medical need in the treatment of depression and other CNS diseases.
The Company’s lead product candidate, esmethadone, is being developed as a rapidly acting, oral agent for the treatment of depression and other potential indications.
On October 15, 2019, we reported top-line data from study REL-1017-202. This was a a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of two doses of REL-1017, 25 mg once a day and 50 mg once a day, as an adjunctive treatment in patients with MDD, who experienced an inadequate response to 1 to 3 treatments with an antidepressant medication.
On December 20, 2020, the Company announced that the first patient had been enrolled in the first Phase 3 clinical trial (RELIANCE I) of REL-1017, as an adjunctive treatment for MDD.
On April 1, 2021, Relmada announced the initiation of RELIANCE II, the second of two sister pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials (RELIANCE I and RELIANCE II) of REL-1017, as an adjunctive treatment for MDD. Patients who complete RELIANCE I and RELIANCE II are eligible to rollover into the long-term, open-label study, which also includes subjects who had not previously participated in a REL-1017 clinical trial.
On October 4, 2021, Relmada announced the initiation of RELIANCE III, the ongoing monotherapy trial for REL-1017, which aims to randomize 364 patients and it is expected to be completed in mid-2022.
Following discussion with the FDA, Relmada’s MDD Phase 3 program includes the following key attributes:
● The Phase 3 program consists of two sister, two-arm, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Each trial will be conducted in 55 clinical sites in the United States and will include planned enrollment of 364 MDD patients with inadequate response to standard antidepressants in their current depression episode. In the studies, patients will add either a 25 mg oral dose of REL-1017 once per day or placebo to their ongoing antidepressant treatment.
● The primary endpoint to be evaluated is the change from baseline on the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score at day-28 for REL-1017 compared to placebo. Success on this endpoint with the collection of sufficient safety data would support the use of REL-1017 for chronic treatment, if approved.
● The change from baseline and the 7-day MADRS score serves as a key secondary endpoint and will provide data on the rapid onset of treatment effect.
In addition, in order to support potential regulatory submissions seeking approval for REL-1017 as adjunctive and monotherapy treatment, the FDA confirmed that, based on what is known at this time, Relmada will not be required to conduct a two-year carcinogenicity study of REL-1017, as sufficient clinical data have been generated to date. The FDA also confirmed that Relmada does not need to conduct a TQT cardiac study in humans to support cardiac safety in potential regulatory submissions for REL-1017, as the data already provided and the data to be generated by the Phase 3 program will be adequate to evaluate the cardiac safety profile of REL-1017.
We have not generated revenues and do not anticipate generating revenues for the foreseeable future. We had a net loss of approximately $125,751,800 and $59,456,400 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2021, we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $305,067,100.
Results of Operations
For the Year Ended December 31, 2021 vs the Year Ended December 31, 2020
Research and Development Expense

Realized loss on short-term investments was approximately $636,000 compared to approximately $156,200 for the same period of 2020, an increase of $479,800. The increase was related to the timing of the sales of short-term investments along with market conditions.
Unrealized loss on short-term investments was approximately $611,400 compared to an unrealized gain on short-term investments of approximately $139,300 for the same period of 2020, an increase of $750,700. The increase was related to the timing of the sales of short-term investments along with market conditions.
Income Taxes

Net Loss
The Company recorded a net loss of approximately $125,751,800 and 59,456,400 or $7.16 and $3.81 per common share, basic and diluted, during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, based on the factors described above.
Liquidity
As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company incurred negative operating cash flows of $91,873,395 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and has an accumulated deficit of $305,067,112 from inception through December 31, 2021.

Effects of Inflation
Our assets are primarily monetary, consisting of cash and cash equivalents. Because of their liquidity, these assets are not directly affected by inflation. Because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment, we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations. However, the rate of inflation affects our expenses, such as those for employee compensation and contract services, which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources.
Lease Obligations
The Company is obligated to pay approximately $78,550 under an office operative lease over the next year.
Seasonality
We do not have a seasonal business cycle.
Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. On a continual basis, management reviews its estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical experience, and reasonable assumptions. After such reviews, and if deemed appropriate, managements estimates are adjusted accordingly. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions under different and/or future circumstances. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:
● it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and
● changes in the estimate, or the use of different estimating methods that could have been selected, could have a material impact on results of operations or financial condition.
We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and none of the Company’s estimates and assumptions used within the consolidated financial statements involve a high level of estimation uncertainty. For additional discussion regarding the application of the significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this report.
