For a description of our business, including descriptions of segments, see the discussion under Business in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report, which is incorporated by reference into this Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report.
Business Trends and Conditions
Title
Our Title segment revenue is closely related to the level of real estate activity that includes sales, mortgage financing and mortgage refinancing. Declines in the level of real estate activity or the average price of real estate sales will adversely affect our title insurance revenues.
We have found that residential real estate activity is generally dependent on the following factors:
•mortgage interest rates;
•mortgage funding supply;
•housing inventory and home prices;
•supply and demand for commercial real estate; and
•the strength of the United States economy, including employment levels.
While we cannot predict the severity and duration of the impacts related to COVID-19, the most recent forecast of the MBA, as of January 21, 2022, estimated (actual for fiscal year 2020) the size of the U.S. residential mortgage originations market as shown in the following table for 2020 - 2024 in its "Mortgage Finance Forecast" (in trillions):
As of January 21, 2022, the MBA expects residential purchase transactions to steadily increase through 2023 before leveling out in 2024. Additionally, the MBA expects residential refinance transactions to steadily decrease in 2022 and 2023 before leveling out in 2024 as interest rates are expected to rise. The MBA expects overall mortgage originations to decrease in 2022 and thereafter.
In recent years, total originations have been reflective of a strong residential real estate market driven by increasing home prices and low mortgage interest rates. Mortgage rates rose consistently between 2016 and the beginning of 2019. Concerns over a slowing global economy and the impact of a prolonged trade war resulted in interest rate cuts in the second half of 2019, which significantly increased refinance transactions and slightly increased purchase transactions when compared to 2018. In the beginning of 2020, refinance and purchase transactions remained strong until the outbreak of COVID-19.
On March 15, 2020, the Federal Reserve took emergency action and reduced its benchmark interest rate by a full percentage point to nearly zero. Following this emergency action, average interest rates for a 30-year fixed rate mortgages fell throughout the remainder of 2020, bottoming out at 2.65% on January 7, 2021. The outbreak of COVID-19 resulted in significant uncertainty in the economic outlook in the second quarter of 2020, and as a result real estate activity decreased significantly as consumers moved to the sidelines to assess the ongoing impact of COVID-19. However, real estate activity began to rebound in June 2020, with increases in purchase activity and a surge in refinance transactions as a result of historically low interest rates.
Residential purchase and refinance activity remained strong in 2021. However, with the surge in residential refinance transactions in 2020, residential refinance transactions began to slow in 2021 as the population of eligible refinance candidates declined. Interest rates on a 30-year, fixed rate mortgage averaged 3.1% in 2021, up from 2.8% in 2020. Despite the recent increase in interest rates and fluctuation in existing-home sales, the market is still outperforming pre-pandemic levels.
Other economic indicators used to measure the health of the U.S. economy, including the unemployment rate and consumer confidence, indicated that the United States was on strong footing prior to the outbreak of COVID-19. However, the impact of COVID-19 reduced the outlook related to these economic indicators in March 2020. According to the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor, the unemployment rate was at a historically low 3.5% in February 2020 but subsequently fluctuated dramatically before reaching 6.7% in December 2020. In 2021, the unemployment rate fell to 3.9% in December of 2021. Additionally, the Conference Board's monthly Consumer Confidence Index remained at high levels through
February 2020 before falling as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. Consumer confidence has since rebounded, reaching its peak in June 2021 before decreasing in the third quarter of 2021 due to concerns over inflation. Consumer confidence remained flat in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Because commercial real estate transactions tend to be generally driven by supply and demand for commercial space and occupancy rates in a particular area rather than by interest rate fluctuations, we believe that our commercial real estate title insurance business is less dependent on the industry cycles discussed above than our residential real estate title business. Commercial real estate transaction volume is also often linked to the availability of financing. Factors including U.S. tax reform and a shift in U.S. monetary policy have had, or are expected to have, varying effects on availability of financing in the U.S. Lower corporate and individual tax rates and corporate tax-deductibility of capital expenditures have provided increased capacity and incentive for investments in commercial real estate. In recent years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced strong demand in commercial real estate markets. In 2020, we experienced decreases in commercial volumes and commercial fee-per-file as a result of the outbreak of COVID-19. Commercial volumes and commercial fee-per-file recovered in the second half of 2020 and remained elevated throughout 2021.
We continually monitor mortgage origination trends and believe that, based on our ability to produce industry leading operating margins through all economic cycles, we are well positioned to adjust our operations for adverse changes in real estate activity and to take advantage of increased volume when demand increases.
See Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report for further discussion of risk factors related to COVID-19.
Seasonality. Historically, real estate transactions have produced seasonal revenue fluctuations in the real estate industry. The first calendar quarter is typically the weakest quarter in terms of revenue due to the generally low volume of home sales during January and February. The second and third calendar quarters are typically the strongest quarters in terms of revenue, primarily due to a higher volume of residential transactions in the spring and summer months. The fourth quarter is typically strong due to the desire of commercial entities to complete transactions by year-end. Seasonality in 2020 and 2021 deviated from historical patterns due to COVID-19. We have noted short-term fluctuations through recent years in resale and refinance transactions as a result of changes in interest rates.
Geographic Operations. Our direct title operations are divided into approximately 180 profit centers. Each profit center processes title insurance transactions within its geographical area, which is usually identified by a county, a group of counties forming a region, or a state, depending on the management structure in that part of the country. We also transact title insurance business through a network of approximately 5,400 agents, primarily in those areas in which agents are the more prevalent title insurance provider. Substantially all of our revenues are generated in the United States.
The following table sets forth the approximate dollar and percentage volumes of our title insurance premium revenue by state:
F&G
The following factors represent some of the key trends and uncertainties that have influenced the development of our F&G segment and its historical financial performance, and we believe these key trends and uncertainties will continue to influence the business and financial performance of our F&G segment in the future.
COVID-19 Pandemic
While still evolving, the COVID-19 pandemic has already caused significant economic and financial turmoil in the U.S. and around the world. At this time, it is still not possible to estimate the longer term-effects the COVID-19 pandemic could have on our F&G segment or our consolidated financial statements. Increased economic uncertainty and increased unemployment that could potentially result from the spread of COVID-19 and its variants may result in F&G policyholders seeking sources of liquidity and withdrawing at rates greater than was previously expected. Additionally, adverse events or conditions resulting from COVID-19 could also have a negative effect on its sales of new policies and could result in more volatility from the impact of mortality experience. As of December 31, 2021, F&G's investment portfolio has recovered from earlier volatility and F&G has not seen a sustained elevated level of adverse policyholder experience from the impact of COVID-19 on the overall business. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our F&G segment's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects will depend on future developments which cannot be predicted at this time.
Market Conditions
Market volatility has affected, and may continue to affect, our business and financial performance in varying ways. Volatility can pressure sales and reduce demand as consumers hesitate to make financial decisions. To enhance the attractiveness and profitability of our products and services, we continually monitor the behavior of our customers, as evidenced by annuitization rates and lapse rates, which vary in response to changes in market conditions. See Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report for further discussion of risk factors that could affect market conditions.
Interest Rate Environment
Some of our F&G products include guaranteed minimum crediting rates, most notably our fixed rate annuities. As of December 31, 2021, our reserves, net of reinsurance, and average crediting rate on our fixed rate annuities were $5.0 billion and 3%, respectively. We are required to pay the guaranteed minimum crediting rates even if earnings on our investment portfolio decline, which would negatively impact earnings. In addition, we expect more policyholders to hold policies with comparatively high guaranteed rates for a longer period in a low interest rate environment. Conversely, a rise in average yield on our investment portfolio would increase earnings if the average interest rate we pay on our products does not rise correspondingly. Similarly, we expect that policyholders would be less likely to hold policies with existing guarantees as interest rates rise and the relative value of other new business offerings are increased, which would negatively impact our earnings and cash flows.
