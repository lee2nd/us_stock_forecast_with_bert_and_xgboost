You should read Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering and developing innovative, protein-based immunotherapies to treat cancer and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Our approach includes a proprietary scientific platform that converts native immune system proteins into differentiated, multi-targeted therapeutics. We believe our strategies are capable of meaningfully modulating the human immune system and significantly improving outcomes in patients with serious diseases.
Autoimmune/Inflammatory Diseases
Acazicolcept, is a dual ICOS and CD28 antagonist intended for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Preclinical studies with acazicolcept have demonstrated efficacy in models of SLE, SjS, arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, uveitis, and graft versus host disease. We have evaluated acazicolcept in a Phase 1 healthy volunteer study and initiated patient dosing in Synergy, a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study of acazicolcept in adults with moderate-to-severe SLE. In June 2020, we entered into an Option and License Agreement with AbbVie Ireland Unlimited Company, or AbbVie, which grants AbbVie an exclusive option to take an exclusive license to acazicolcept. Through December 31, 2021, we have received $105.0 million in upfront and pre-option exercise development milestones as part of the AbbVie Agreement.
ALPN-303 is a dual B cell cytokine antagonist, being developed for the treatment of B cell mediated inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Engineered using our proprietary directed evolution platform, ALPN-303 potently inhibits BAFF, BLyS and APRIL, which play key roles in B cell development, differentiation, and survival, and together contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune diseases such as SLE and many other autoantibody-related inflammatory diseases. Data presented at the ACR Convergence 2021 Annual Meeting demonstrated that ALPN-303 inhibits the activity of the B cell cytokines APRIL and BAFF more potently than wild-type TACI-Fc counterparts, as well as anti-BAFF and anti-APRIL monoclonal antibodies. In addition, ALPN-303 has been well-tolerated in preclinical models and exhibited superior pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics over wild-type TACI-Fc counterparts, including superior serum exposure, suppression of T-dependent antibody production, and/or serum immunoglobulins in mice and/or cynomolgus monkeys. A first-in-human, Phase 1 study of ALPN-303 in healthy volunteers began in the fourth quarter of 2021, with top-line results targeted by mid-2022. This randomized, placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ALPN-303 administered intravenously and subcutaneously. We are planning to initiate patient-based studies in the second half of 2022 including SLE, and possibly other autoantibody-related diseases in other therapeutic areas.
In December 2021, we entered into the Horizon Agreement which grants Horizon an exclusive license for the development, manufacture and commercialization of one Existing Program and up to three additional Research Programs generated from our libraries of proteins and molecules for research, discovery and identification of additional compounds. Under the terms of the agreement, Horizon made an upfront payment to us of $25.0 million as well as an equity investment for which they paid $15.0 million, a 25 percent premium to the 30-day volume-weighted average share price as of December 9, 2021. In addition, we are eligible to receive up to $381.0 million per program, or approximately $1.5 billion in total, in future success-based payments related to development, regulatory and commercial milestones as well as tiered royalties on global net sales.
Immuno-oncology
Our lead oncology program is davoceticept, a conditional CD28 costimulator and dual checkpoint inhibitor intended for the treatment of cancer. Preclinical in vivo data have demonstrated monotherapy efficacy in tumor models superior to approved therapies. In June 2020, we initiated NEON-1, a Phase 1 monotherapy dose escalation and expansion study in patients with advanced malignancies. Initial data from NEON-1 were presented at the 2021 ASCO Virtual Meeting demonstrating that davoceticept was well-tolerated as of the cutoff date (April 22, 2021) with evidence of peripheral T cell modulation consistent with CD28 agonism. In addition, although most enrolled participants had tumors considered classically non-responsive to
immunotherapies, 61% (14 of 23 evaluable) derived clinical benefit as defined as a best outcome of stable disease or better. Completion of dose escalation for NEON-1 and initiation of expansion cohorts is anticipated in the first half of 2022.
In June 2021, we announced a collaboration and supply agreement with Merck to evaluate the safety and efficacy of davoceticept in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in a Phase 1 dose escalation and expansion study. The clinical trial, NEON-2, was initiated in June 2021. As discussed above, on March 7, 2022, we announced that the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on the NEON-2 trial in response to the death of a study participant in the NEON-2 trial. The participant’s death was attributed to cardiogenic shock, considered by the treating physicians as likely related to immune-mediated myocarditis, or possibly infection. Participants who are currently enrolled in the NEON-2 trial may continue to receive davoceticept and pembrolizumab, although no new participants may be enrolled until the partial clinical hold is resolved. This partial clinical hold does not affect the ongoing NEON-1 clinical trial of davoceticept as monotherapy (NCT04186637).
Our scientific platform has also generated immune modulatory proteins with the potential of improving engineered cell therapies, such as CAR-T, TCR-T, and TILs. In May 2019, we signed a collaboration and license agreement with Adaptimmune to develop next-generation SPEARTM T cell products which incorporate our secreted and transmembrane immunomodulatory protein (termed SIP™ and TIP™) technology. We intend to continue to leverage our existing pipeline and platform to actively explore and evaluate potential value-creating partnering opportunities.
Our goal is to discover and develop modern therapies to treat patients with serious conditions such as cancer and autoimmune/inflammatory diseases. To achieve our goals, we intend to:
•aggressively move our lead autoimmune/inflammatory program acazicolcept through clinical development as part of the AbbVie Agreement, including conducting Synergy, our Phase 2 study for the treatment of SLE;
•aggressively move our second autoimmune/inflammatory program ALPN-303 through a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers and into clinical studies for the treatment of B cell mediated autoimmune/inflammatory diseases;
•aggressively move our lead oncology program davoceticept through clinical development for the treatment of cancer; and
•maximize the value of our pipeline and platform via potential partnering activities.
Our operations to date have been limited to business planning, raising capital, developing our platform technology, identifying potential immunotherapy candidates, clinical studies, and other research and development activities. To date, we have financed operations primarily through private placements of common stock and convertible preferred stock, funds received from license and research agreements, debt financing and assets acquired upon the close of our merger with Nivalis Therapeutics Inc., or Nivalis. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any product sales. Since inception and through December 31, 2021, excluding amounts borrowed through debt financing, we have raised an aggregate of $393.1 million to fund operations, of which $170.6 million was from the sale of common stock and warrants, $49.2 million was from the sale of convertible preferred stock, $129.2 million was through our license and collaboration agreements, and $44.1 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities acquired through the merger with Nivalis. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments totaling $215.4 million.
Our net loss was $50.3 million, $27.9 million, and $41.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We expect to continue incurring significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years as we:
•initiate and complete nonclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates, including acazicolcept, a dual ICOS/CD28 antagonist program targeting autoimmune/inflammatory disorders, davoceticept, a conditional CD28 costimulator and dual checkpoint inhibitor intended for the treatment of cancer, and ALPN-303, a dual B cell cytokine antagonist for B cell-mediated autoimmune/inflammatory diseases;
•contract to manufacture and perform additional process development for our product candidates;
•continue research and development efforts to build our pipeline beyond the current product candidates;
•maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•hire additional clinical, quality control, scientific, and management personnel; and
•add operational and financial personnel to support our product development efforts and operational capabilities applicable to operating as a public company.
We do not expect to generate product revenue unless and until we successfully complete development of, obtain marketing approval for and commercialize our product candidates, either alone or in collaboration with third parties. We expect these activities will take a number of years and our success in these efforts is subject to significant uncertainty. Accordingly, we will need to raise additional capital prior to the regulatory approval and commercialization of any of our product candidates. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our operating activities through equity or debt financings, collaborations or licenses, capital lease transactions, or other available financing transactions. However, additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and if we raise additional funds through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities, it could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and increased fixed payment obligations.
Financial Overview
Collaboration Revenue
We derive our collaboration revenue primarily from our collaboration and licensing agreements. We may generate revenue in the future from milestone payments received pursuant to our collaboration and licensing agreements with AbbVie, Horizon, Adaptimmune, or from payments from future license or collaboration agreements, product sales, or government contracts and grants. We expect revenue we generate, if any, will fluctuate from quarter to quarter.
Horizon
In December 2021, we entered into the Horizon Agreement which grants Horizon an exclusive license for the development, manufacture and commercialization of one Existing Program and up to three additional Research Programs generated from our libraries of proteins and molecules for research, discovery and identification of additional compounds.
Under the terms of the agreement, Horizon made an upfront payment to us of $25.0 million as well as an equity investment for which they paid $15.0 million, a 25 percent premium to the 30-day volume-weighted average share price as of December 9, 2021. In addition, we are eligible to receive up to $381.0 million per program, or approximately $1.5 billion in total, in future success-based payments related to development, regulatory and commercial milestones as well as tiered royalties on global net sales. We will conduct our activities under the Existing Program and up to three Research Programs to deliver compounds meeting agreed criteria. In addition, Horizon will pay us for the costs and expenses of conducting such activities under the deliverables plans. Horizon will then assume responsibility for development and commercialization activities and costs.
For revenue recognition purposes, we determined that the Existing Program and each Research Program are distinct performance obligations. We allocated revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative stand-alone selling price. The future success-based payments related to development and regulatory milestones are probable of significant revenue reversal as the achievement is highly dependent on factors outside our control. Therefore, these milestone payments are fully constrained and are not initially included in the transaction price. We will continue to re-evaluate the transaction price each reporting period and update as uncertain events are resolved or other changes in circumstances occur. Any consideration related to commercial milestones and royalties will be recognized when the related sales occur.
AbbVie
In June 2020, we entered into the AbbVie Agreement for the development of acazicolcept. The AbbVie Agreement grants AbbVie the exclusive option to purchase an exclusive worldwide license to acazicolcept, or the License Option. The License Option is exercisable by AbbVie at any time and will expire 90 days from the achievement of certain development milestones. If AbbVie exercises the License Option, AbbVie will take over the future development and commercialization. Prior to the exercise of the License Option, we will perform research and development services, including conducting our Phase 2 study in SLE, based on an agreed-upon development plan, or the Development Plan. We will be fully responsible for all costs incurred to conduct the activities under the Development Plan, provided that, AbbVie may be responsible for increased costs under the Development Plan in connection with certain material amendments proposed by AbbVie. We will also be solely responsible, at our sole cost and expense, for manufacturing and regulatory filings for acazicolcept necessary to complete activities under the Development Plan.
In June 2020, in connection with the execution of the AbbVie Agreement, AbbVie paid us a nonrefundable upfront payment of $60.0 million. Prior to the exercise of the License Option, AbbVie has agreed to make cash payments upon our achievement of certain predefined pre-option development milestones, or the Alpine Development Milestones, up to an aggregate amount of $75.0 million. In the second quarter of 2021, we achieved $45.0 million of the Alpine Development Milestones. If AbbVie exercises the License Option, they will pay a one-time cash payment of $75.0 million. Following the exercise of the License Option, AbbVie has also agreed to make aggregate cash payments of up to $205.0 million upon
AbbVie’s achievement of certain development and commercial milestones and additional aggregate cash payments of up to $450.0 million upon AbbVie’s achievement of certain sales-based cash milestones, collectively referred to as the AbbVie Milestones. Subsequent to commercialization, we are also eligible to receive high single-digit to low double-digit percentage royalties on worldwide net sales of licensed products.
For revenue recognition purposes, we determined that our contractual promises in the AbbVie Agreement are not distinct and are interdependent with our performance obligation to provide research and development services under the Development Plan. Thus, all contractual promises related to the upfront payment and Alpine’s Development Milestones were combined into a single performance obligation. We determined the Alpine Development Milestone payments are probable of significant revenue reversal as the achievement is highly dependent on factors outside our control. Therefore, these milestone payments were fully constrained and were not initially included in the transaction price. In June 2021, we re-evaluated and updated the transaction price to include the achieved portion of the Alpine Development Milestones. We will continue to re-evaluate the transaction price each reporting period and update as uncertain events are resolved or other changes in circumstances occur.
The License Option and the AbbVie Milestones were not determined to be performance obligations at the inception of the contract as they did not represent material rights. If exercised, the License Option and AbbVie Milestones will be accounted for as a separate contract and will be recognized as revenue if and when triggered. Any consideration related to sales-based royalties and profit-sharing payments will be recognized when the related sales occur.
We use a cost-based input method to measure progress toward completion of the performance obligation and to calculate the corresponding revenue to recognize each period. In applying the cost-based input, we use actual costs incurred relative to budgeted costs for the combined performance obligation. These costs consist primarily of internal personnel efforts and third-party contract costs relative to the level of patient enrollment in the study. Revenue will be recognized based on the level of costs incurred relative to the total budgeted costs for the performance obligation. A cost-based input method of revenue recognition requires management to make estimates of costs to complete our performance obligation. In making such estimates, significant judgment is required to evaluate assumptions related to cost estimates. The cumulative effect of revisions to estimated costs to complete our performance obligation will be recorded in the period in which changes are identified and amounts can be reasonably estimated. A significant change in these assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the timing and amount of revenue recognized in future periods.
We recognized revenue from the AbbVie Agreement of $23.4 million and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 the remaining balance of the transaction price is $74.5 million and is recorded as current and noncurrent deferred revenue on our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We expect to recognize the remaining deferred revenue over the remainder of our Development Plan, which began in June 2020 and will end upon the later of the exercise or expiration of the option.
Adaptimmune
In May 2019, we entered into the Adaptimmune Agreement with Adaptimmune, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on providing novel cell therapies to patients, particularly for the treatment of solid tumors, to develop next-generation SPEAR T cell products which incorporate our SIP and TIP technologies. Under the Adaptimmune Agreement, we are to perform certain research services and grant Adaptimmune an exclusive license to programs from our SIP and TIP technologies. In June 2019, under the terms of the Adaptimmune Agreement, we received an upfront license payment of $2.0 million and through December 31, 2021 we have received an additional $1.6 million in research support payments to fund ongoing programs. These payments were recorded to deferred revenue upon receipt and were recognized as revenue based on employee hours contributed to each performance obligation. In the fourth quarter of 2020, based on the completion of our initial research and development efforts in connection with our performance obligations, we recognized the remaining balance in deferred revenue associated with Adaptimmune on our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the Adaptimmune Agreement, we recognized no revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, and $2.3 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, we are eligible for additional research support payments, one-time payments and downstream development and commercialization milestones of up to $288.0 million, if all pre-specified milestones for each program are achieved. We are also eligible to receive low-single digit percentage royalties on worldwide net sales of the applicable products. In February 2022, Adaptimmune selected an additional research program, triggering a $1.0 million upfront payment, which will be recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt and recognized to revenue based on employee hours contributed.
Research and Development Expenses
We focus our resources on research and development activities, including the conduct of preclinical studies, product development, regulatory support, and clinical trials for our product candidates. We recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred. Our research and development expenses consist of:
•employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, taxes, travel, and stock-based compensation expense for personnel in research and development functions;
•expenses related to process development and production of product candidates paid to contract manufacturing organizations;
•costs associated with preclinical activities and regulatory operations, including the cost of acquiring, developing, and manufacturing research material;
•clinical trials and activities related to regulatory filings for our product candidates; and
•allocation of facilities, overhead, depreciation, and amortization of laboratory equipment and other expenses.
The table below summarizes our research and development expenses for the periods indicated. Our direct research and development expenses consist primarily of expenses incurred pursuant to agreements with third-party manufacturing organizations for our product candidates, CROs, clinical trial sites, collaborators, and consultants. Other direct costs included direct research and development costs incurred before a selected product candidate begins clinical trials.
We use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research and development programs that we are advancing in parallel, and therefore do not allocate salaries, stock-based compensation, employee benefit expenses or other indirect costs related to our research and development to specific product candidates. These expenses are included in indirect research and development expense by type in the table below.
Our research and development expenses are summarized as follows (in thousands):
We expect our research and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop our platform and product candidates.
The successful development of our platform and product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing, or costs of the efforts necessary to finish developing any of our product candidates or the period in which material net cash, if any, from these product candidates may commence. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing therapeutics, including the uncertainty of:
•the scope, rate of progress, expense, and results of clinical trials;
•the scope, rate of progress, and expense of process development and manufacturing;
•preclinical and other research activities; and
•the timing of regulatory approvals.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for employees in executive, business development, finance, and administrative functions. Other significant general and administrative expenses include professional fees for accounting and legal services, expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents and other intellectual property, and allocation of facility and overhead costs.
We expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we expand infrastructure, headcount, and continue to prosecute our patents and other intellectual property. Other increases could potentially include increased costs for insurance, costs related to the hiring of additional personnel, and increased fees for directors, outside consultants, lawyers, and accountants. We expect to incur significant costs to comply with corporate governance, internal controls, and similar requirements applicable to public companies.
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists primarily of interest associated with our term loan with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, and the amortization of the related debt discount.
Interest Income
Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments.
Other (Expense) Income
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, other (expense) income consists primarily of research and development tax credits received by our wholly-owned Australian subsidiary and an employee retention tax credit related to COVID-19 relief legislation. Other (expense) income was immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Results of Operations
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):
Collaboration Revenue
Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 consists of $23.4 million recognized under the AbbVie Agreement, an increase from prior year as we execute on our AbbVie Development Plan. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 consists of $7.0 million recognized under the AbbVie Agreement and $2.3 million recognized under the Adaptimmune Agreement.
Research and Development Expenses
The $31.6 million increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to increases of $10.8 million in clinical trial activity primarily related to our Synergy and NEON studies, $10.0 million in contract manufacturing and process development of our product candidates primarily for acazicolcept and ALPN-303, and $4.8 million in preclinical and other research activities. Additionally, we had an increase of $5.7 million related to personnel expenses, which includes $1.2 million in stock-based compensation expense, and an increase of $0.3 million related to overhead and facilities.
General and Administrative Expenses
The $3.7 million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increases of $2.5 million in personnel related expenses, which includes $0.9 million in stock-based compensation expense, $0.8 million related to professional and legal services, and $0.4 million in insurance, facility and other costs to support the growth and expansion of our business.
Interest Expense
Interest expense relates primarily to interest paid on our term loan with SVB and the related non-cash interest expense associated with the amortization of the debt discount. Interest expense during the 2021 period is slightly higher due to additional interest related to the drawdown of the second tranche of our SVB loan in March 2020.
Interest Income
Higher average investment balances during 2021, combined with lower interest rates produced relatively consistent interest income as compared to the 2020 period.
Other (Expense) Income
Other expense during 2021 consisted of a loss on an asset disposal. In 2020, other income consisted of a $1.0 million research and development tax credit received by our wholly-owned Australian subsidiary and a $0.3 million employee retention tax credit related to COVID-19 relief legislation.
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
Collaboration Revenue
Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 consists of $7.0 million recognized under the AbbVie Agreement and $2.3 million recognized under the Adaptimmune Agreement. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 consists of $1.3 million related to the Adaptimmune Agreement and $0.4 million related to the milestone payment from Laurel from the sale of our GSNOR assets.
Research and Development Expenses
The $8.7 million decrease in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to decreases of $5.7 million in contract manufacturing and process development of our product candidates and $4.1 million in other research activities. The decreases were partially offset by increases of $0.6 million in clinical trial activity and $0.5 million in stock-based compensation.
General and Administrative Expenses
The $1.4 million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable increases of $0.8 million related to professional and legal services, $0.6 million in stock-based compensation and $0.4 million in insurance and facility costs to support the growth and expansion of our business. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.4 million related primarily to personnel expenses.
Interest Expense
Interest expense relates primarily to interest paid on our term loan with SVB and the related non-cash interest expense associated with the amortization of the debt discount. The $0.4 million increase in interest expense is due to additional interest related to the drawdown of the second tranche of our SVB loan in March 2020.
Interest Income
The $1.0 million decrease in interest income is due primarily to less interest earned on our investments as we maintained a lower average investment balance during the 2020 period.
Other (Expense) Income
The $0.5 million increase in other (expense) income is attributable a $0.2 million increase in research and development tax credits received by our wholly-owned Australian subsidiary. Additionally, for the 2020 period, we recognized a $0.3 million employee retention tax credit related to COVID-19 relief legislation.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities, debt, and payments received under our collaboration agreements. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments totaling $215.4 million. Except for any obligations of our collaborators to make milestone payments under our agreements with them, we do not have any committed external sources of capital. Until such time as we can generate substantial product revenue, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of collaboration agreements and equity or debt financings.
Equity Financing Agreements
In December 2021, in connection with the execution of the Horizon Agreement, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Horizon, or the Purchase Agreement, in which Horizon made an equity investment in Alpine of 951,980 shares of our common stock for approximately $15.76 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $15.0 million. The purchase price represents a 25% premium to the volume-weighted average share price of our common stock for the 30-day period ended December 9, 2021. The shares are subject to lock-up restrictions, which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibit Horizon from selling the shares for a period of six months after the date of the Purchase Agreement. The shares were recorded at the fair value of our common stock on the effective date of the Horizon Agreement, with the excess of the proceeds recorded to deferred revenue.
In September 2021, we entered into a securities purchase agreement, or the 2021 Securities Purchase Agreement, for a private placement with a select group of institutional investors, pursuant to which we sold 6,489,357 shares of our common stock, or the Shares, and prefunded warrants to purchase 3,191,487 Shares, or the Prefunded Warrants. The purchase price for each Share and for each Prefunded Warrant was $9.40 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $91.0 million. The Prefunded Warrants became fully exercisable upon the closing date and have an exercise price of $0.001 per share. In connection with the 2021 Securities Purchase Agreement approximately 3.7 million of the Shares issued and approximately 2.3 million of the Prefunded Warrants issued, for gross proceeds of approximately $57.0 million, were issued to certain stockholders whose beneficial ownership exceeded 5% prior to completion of the 2021 Securities Purchases Agreement.
In July 2021, we entered into a sales agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with Cowen and Company, LLC, or Cowen, pursuant to which we may sell shares of our common stock from time to time through an “at the market” equity offering for up to $75.0 million in gross cash proceeds. Cowen will act as the sales agent and will be entitled to compensation for services of up to 3.0% of the gross sales price per share of all shares sold through Cowen under the Sales Agreement. The shares would be issued pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-256107). We filed a prospectus supplement, dated July 2, 2021, with the SEC in connection with the offer and sale of the shares pursuant to the Sales Agreement. As of the date of this report, we have made no such sales under the Sales Agreement.
In July 2020, we entered into a securities purchase agreement, or the 2020 Securities Purchase Agreement, for a private placement with a select group of institutional investors, pursuant to which we sold 5,139,610 units, or the Common Units, and 790,710 units, or the Prefunded Warrant Units, for an aggregate purchase price of $60.0 million. Each Common Unit consists of one share of our common stock plus a warrant to purchase 0.3 shares of common stock, or the Common Stock Warrants, and each Prefunded Warrant Unit consists of one prefunded warrant to purchase one share of common stock, or the Prefunded Warrants, plus one Common Stock Warrant to purchase 0.3 shares of common stock. The Prefunded Warrant Units and the Common Units are collectively referred to as the Units and each Unit has a purchase price of $10.1175. The Common Stock Warrants have an exercise price of $12.74 and a term of 3.5 years. The Prefunded Warrants became fully exercisable upon the closing date and have an exercise price of $0.001 per share.
In January 2019, we entered into a securities purchase agreement, or the 2019 Securities Purchase Agreement, with a limited number of accredited investors, pursuant to which we sold approximately 4.7 million units, or the 2019 Units, for an aggregate purchase price of $25.3 million in a private placement, which we refer to as the Private Placement. Each 2019 Unit has a purchase price of $5.37 and consists of one share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase 0.39 shares of common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the 2019 Securities Purchase Agreement, we issued approximately 4.7 million shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of approximately 1.8 million shares of common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $12.74 and have a term of five years.
Debt Financing Agreements
In August 2019, we entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, or the Loan Agreement, with SVB, pursuant to which SVB agreed to extend term loans to us with an aggregate principal amount of up to $15.0 million, or the Term Loans. Borrowings under the Loan Agreement consisted of up to three separate tranches. The initial tranche of $5.0 million was funded in August 2019, $3.0 million of which was used to repay amounts owing under our prior loan and security agreement with SVB. In March 2020, the second tranche of $5.0 million was funded to us. We did not draw down the final tranche of $5.0 million, which expired on July 31, 2020.
The Term Loans accrue interest at a floating per annum rate of 0.25% above the prime rate, subject to a floor of 5.75%, which interest is payable monthly commencing in September 2019. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, a default interest rate will apply that is 4.0% above the otherwise applicable interest rate. The Term Loans were interest only until September 30, 2020, however, under the Loan Agreement our interest only period automatically extended to June 30, 2021 if we received aggregate new capital of at least $40.0 million no later than June 30, 2020. We met this milestone in June 2020 in conjunction with the execution of the AbbVie Agreement, discussed in detail in Note 11. As a result of the interest only extension, the Term Loans will be payable in 25 equal monthly installments of principal plus interest, with the final installment due and payable on July 1, 2023.
We may prepay all, but not less than all, of the Term Loans subject to a prepayment fee equal to $75,000, which represents the deferred portion of the final payment due under the Original Agreement, plus the outstanding principal balance under the Term Loans at the time of such prepayment multiplied by a prepayment fee of 2.0% in the first year, 1.0% in the second year, and 0.0% in the third year and thereafter. Additionally a final payment in the amount of 5.5% of the funded Term Loans is payable to SVB on the date on which the Term Loans are prepaid, paid or become due and payable in full. The final payment fees are recorded in long-term debt with an offsetting reduction to debt discount on our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Loan Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default and affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, covenants that limit or restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, make acquisitions, pay dividends or other distributions or repurchase equity, make investments, dispose of assets, engage in any new lines of business, and enter into certain transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to certain exceptions. Among other events, a failure to make a required loan payment, an uncured covenant breach or a material adverse change in our business, operations or condition (financial or otherwise) could lead to an event of default, and in such case, all amounts then outstanding may become due and payable immediately. We were in compliance with our covenants as of December 31, 2021. As security for its obligations under the Loan Agreement, we granted SVB a first priority security interest on substantially all of our assets, except intellectual property, and subject to certain other exceptions. As of December 31, 2021, we had $8.2 million in outstanding principal and final fees due under our term loan agreement. See Note 9 for further discussion of our Term Loans.
Cash Flows
The following is a summary of our cash flows (in thousands):
Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities:
Net cash used in operating activities was $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and consisted primarily of our net loss of $50.3 million. This was offset by an increase of $27.3 million in our net operating assets and liabilities. Additionally, we had a $7.8 million increase in our net non-cash adjustments, which primarily relates to stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and consisted primarily of our net loss of $27.9 million. This was offset by an increase of $52.9 million in our net operating assets and liabilities. This increase was primarily driven by the receipt of a $60.0 million upfront payment from AbbVie, which was recorded as current and noncurrent deferred revenue on our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, we had an increase of $5.1 million in our net non-cash adjustments, which primarily relates to stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization.
Net cash used in operating activities was $35.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and consisted primarily of our net loss of $41.9 million. This was offset by an increase of $3.2 million in our net operating assets and liabilities and an increase of $3.3 million in our net non-cash adjustments, which primarily relate to stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization.
Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities:
Cash flows from investing activities primarily reflect cash used to purchase investments and proceeds from the maturities and sales of investments, thus causing a shift between our cash and cash equivalents and investment balances. We manage our cash usage with respect to our total cash, cash equivalents and investments.
Net cash used in investing activities was $52.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and consisted primarily of our purchases and maturities of investments in U.S. Treasury securities, commercial paper, and corporate debt securities, partially offset by purchases of property and equipment, primarily lab equipment, to support our research and development efforts.
Net cash used in investing activities was $72.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and consisted primarily of our purchases and maturities of investments in U.S. Treasury securities, commercial paper, and corporate debt securities, partially offset by purchases of property and equipment, primarily lab equipment, to support our research and development efforts.
Net cash provided by investing activities was $16.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 and consisted primarily of the maturities, sales and purchases of short-term investments in U.S. Treasury securities, commercial paper, and corporate debt securities, partially offset by purchases of property and equipment, primarily lab equipment, to support our research and development efforts.
Net cash provided by financing activities:
Net cash provided by financing activities was $100.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and consisted primarily of the net proceeds of $90.7 million related to the sale of approximately 6.5 million shares of common stock and 3.2 million prefunded warrants under our 2021 Securities Purchase Agreement, $11.9 million in proceeds related to the fair value of our common stock purchased by Horizon in December 2021, and $0.5 million related to the exercise of stock options. These were partially offset by $2.4 million in principal payments on our debt.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $61.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and consisted primarily of the net proceeds of $56.3 million related to the sale of approximately 5.9 million Units under our 2020 Securities Purchase Agreement, $5.0 million in proceeds received from the draw down of the second tranche of our Loan Agreement in March 2020, and $0.1 million related to the exercise of stock options.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and consisted primarily of the net proceeds of $23.6 million related to the sale of approximately 4.7 million Units under our 2019 Securities Purchase Agreement and $2.0 million in net proceeds from our debt refinancing, partially offset by $1.3 million in principal payments on our debt.
Funding Requirements
We have incurred operating losses since inception. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue our research and preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates; expand the scope of our current studies for our product candidates; initiate additional preclinical, clinical or other studies for our product candidates, including under any collaboration agreements; change or add additional manufacturers or suppliers; seek regulatory and marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical studies; seek to identify, evaluate and validate additional product candidates; acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; maintain, protect and expand our intellectual property portfolio; attract and retain skilled personnel; and experience any delays or encounter issues with any of the above. Additionally, we have ongoing obligations with respect to our Loan Agreement, as described above, and our Operating Lease and certain contingencies, as described below.
Operating Lease
In March 2019, we entered into a lease with ARE-Seattle No. 28, LLC, or the Landlord, for 27,164 square feet of office and laboratory space located at 188 East Blaine Street, Seattle, Washington. The term of the lease is 10.8 years with one option to extend the term by 5 years. The lease term commenced in June 2019. The “Rent Commencement Date” began in March 2020, nine months after the commencement date. We were not required to pay base rent from the Rent Commencement Date through November 2020, the last day of the ninth month following the Rent Commencement Date. The annual base rent under the lease is $1.7 million for the first year and will increase by 3.0% each year thereafter. We received a tenant improvement allowance of $5.4 million, which is included in our base rent, and a maximum additional tenant improvement allowance of $1.8 million, which will result in additional rent amortized over the term of the lease at an annual rate of 8.0%. The lease also requires us to pay additional amounts for operating and maintenance expenses. In March 2019, in connection with the lease, we provided a $254,000 letter of credit as a security deposit, which is recorded as restricted cash in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. See further discussion of our operating lease in Note 10.
Contingencies
Certain credits received related to our research and development expenditures and recorded within other income in our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) are subject to review by foreign taxing authorities. It is reasonably possible we may incur losses upon the completion of these reviews of up to approximately $1.8 million, which we would be required to repay to certain tax authorities.
Until such time as we can generate substantial product revenue, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity or debt financings and collaboration agreements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the future sale of equity or debt, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing common stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration agreements in the future, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Our future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors, including:
•the number and characteristics of the future product candidates we pursue either from our internal research efforts or through acquiring or in-licensing other product candidates or technologies;
•the scope, progress, results and costs of independently researching and developing any of our future product candidates, including conducting preclinical research and clinical trials;
•whether our existing collaborations generate substantial milestone payments and, ultimately, royalties on future approved products for us;
•the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for any future product candidates we develop independently;
•the cost of future commercialization activities, if any;
•the cost of manufacturing our future product candidates and products, if any;
•our ability to maintain our existing collaborations and to establish new collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such arrangements;
•the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patents, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; and
•the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, our current or future collaborators’ product candidates, and our future products, if any.
We have considered that our long-term operations anticipate continuing net losses and the need for potential equity or debt financing. We have also considered that new collaborations or selectively partnering our technology or programs may provide other sources of capital. However, there can be no assurances that additional funding or other sources of capital will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Based on our current operating plan, we believe our available cash and cash equivalents and investments, will be sufficient to fund our planned level of operations for at least the next 12 months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we expect. Additionally, the process of testing drug candidates in preclinical and clinical studies is costly, and the timing of progress in these studies remains uncertain. Further, inflation may affect our use of capital resources by increasing our cost of labor and clinical trial expenses. Our long-term funding requirements will consist of operational, capital, and manufacturing expenditures, including those contractual commitments described above. Because of the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of capital outflows and operating expenditures associated with our long-term anticipated preclinical studies and clinical trials.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.
Accrued Liabilities
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate accruals for professional services and research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing contracts and vendor agreements and communicating with applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf. We estimate the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. We estimate accrued liabilities as of each balance sheet date based on known facts and circumstances.
Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, we may report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, we have not experienced any significant adjustments to our estimates.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue recognition is a critical accounting estimate due to the magnitude and nature of the upfront cash and milestone payments we receive. Our primary sources of revenue is derived from our collaboration and licensing agreements.
Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Our steps for recognizing revenue consist of; (1) identifying the contract, (2) identifying the performance obligations as either distinct or bundled goods and services, (3) determining the transaction price associated with each performance obligation for which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring such goods and services, (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5) recognizing revenue upon satisfaction of performance obligations.
Our collaboration agreements principally contain multiple performance obligations, which may include (1) grants of, or options to obtain, intellectual property licenses; (2) research and development services; and/or (3) manufacturing or supply services. Payments typically received under these arrangements include one or more of the following: non-refundable upfront license fees, option exercise fees, payment for research and/or development efforts, amounts due upon the achievement of specified objectives, and/or royalties on future product sales. Our revenue is primarily derived from our collaboration agreements with Adaptimmune, AbbVie, and Horizon. See further discussion of our collaboration agreements in Note 11.
We allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine stand-alone selling prices at the inception of the contract based on our best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable was regularly sold by us on a stand-alone basis. Payments received prior to satisfying the relevant revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognized as revenue when the related revenue recognition criteria are met. We recognize revenue under our collaboration agreements by using a cost-based input method to measure progress toward completion of the performance obligation, including employee hours contributed to each performance obligation, and to calculate the corresponding revenue to recognize each period.
Our collaboration agreements provide for non-refundable milestone payments. We recognize revenue that is contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved. A milestone is considered substantive when the consideration payable to us for such milestone (1) is consistent with our performance necessary to achieve the milestone or the increase in value to the collaboration resulting from our performance; (2) relates solely to our past performance; and (3) is reasonable relative to all of the other deliverables and payments within the arrangement. In making this assessment, we consider all facts and circumstances relevant to the arrangement, including factors such as the scientific, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the milestone, the level of effort and investment required to achieve the milestone and whether any portion of the milestone consideration is related to future performance or deliverables.
We review the contributed employee hours and progress towards completion for each performance obligation under our collaboration agreements and adjust the revenue recognized to reflect changes in assumptions relating to the estimated satisfaction of the performance obligation. Revenue recognition may be accelerated in the event of early termination of programs or if our expectations change. Alternatively, revenue recognition may be decelerated if programs are extended or delayed. While such changes to our estimates have no impact on our reported cash flows, the timing of revenue recorded in future periods could be materially impacted.
Stock-based Compensation
Stock-based compensation is recognized for all share-based payments based on the estimated fair value as of the date of grant. The fair value of our stock options is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires us to apply our judgment regarding certain key assumptions including risk-free interest rate, expected term, volatility and dividend yield. For risk-free interest rate, we use the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury instruments security rate with a term equal to the expected life of the option. We use the “simplified method” for options to determine the expected term of stock options. Under this approach, the weighted-average expected life is presumed to be the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option. For volatility, we analyzed the stock price volatility of companies at a similar stage of development to estimate expected volatility of our stock price. Our assumed dividend yield is zero as we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash dividends. The fair value of restricted stock units, or RSUs, is based on the closing price of our common stock on the award date. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period of the awards, usually the vesting
period, on a straight-line basis. For performance-based awards where the vesting of the options may be accelerated upon the achievement of certain milestones, the related stock-based compensation is recognized as expense when it is probable the milestone will be met. We recognize forfeiture of awards as they occur rather than estimating the expected forfeiture rate.
If factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, or if we decide to use a different valuation model, the stock-based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our financial statements.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the applicable enacted tax rates. We will establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will expire before we are able to realize their benefits or that future deductibility is uncertain.
We recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense if incurred.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2019-12, Income Taxes, or Topic 740: Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This ASU simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and also improves consistent application by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2021, and concluded that the adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
