ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Understanding Our Financial Information
This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The following discussion includes statements that are forward-looking statements and are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in the section entitled "Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements" and in Item 1A. "Risk Factors." References to "fiscal year" or "fiscal" refer to our fiscal year ending on December 31 in each calendar year.
Overview
Company Background
Boise Cascade is a large, vertically-integrated wood products manufacturer and building materials distributor with widespread operations throughout the United States (U.S.) and one manufacturing facility in Canada. We completed an initial public offering of our common stock on February 11, 2013. We have two reportable segments: (i) Wood Products, which primarily manufactures engineered wood products (EWP) and plywood; and (ii) Building Materials Distribution (BMD), which is a wholesale distributor of building materials. For more information, see Note 3, Revenues, and Note 16, Segment Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" and "Item 1. Business" of this Form 10-K. Our products are used in the construction of new residential housing, including single-family, multi-family, and manufactured homes, the repair-and-remodeling of existing housing, the construction of light industrial and commercial buildings, and industrial applications. We have a broad base of customers, which includes a diverse mix of dealers, home improvement centers, leading wholesalers, specialty distributors, and industrial converters. Our Wood Products and BMD segments are vertically-integrated from wood fiber procurement through distribution. During 2021, approximately 62% of our Wood Products segment sales, or approximately 78% and 28% of our Wood Product segment's EWP and plywood sales volumes, respectively, were to our BMD segment.
Executive Summary
We recorded income from operations of $971.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with $335.0 million during the same period in the prior year. In our Wood Products segment, income increased by $403.5 million to $531.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $127.7 million in 2020. The increase in segment income was due primarily to higher plywood, EWP, and lumber sales prices, as well as higher EWP sales volumes and lower depreciation and amortization expense. These improvements were offset partially by higher wood fiber costs and other manufacturing costs. In our BMD segment, income improved $233.6 million to $481.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $247.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, driven by a gross margin increase of $296.8 million, resulting from improved gross margins across our EWP, general line, and commodity product categories. The margin improvement was offset partially by increased selling and distribution expenses and general and administrative expenses of $60.6 million and $2.9 million, respectively. These changes are discussed further in "Our Operating Results" below.
We ended 2021 with $748.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $444.6 million of debt. At December 31, 2021, we had $346.0 million of unused committed bank line availability. We generated $343.5 million of cash during the year ended December 31, 2021, as cash provided by operations was offset partially by capital spending and dividends paid on our common stock. A further description of our cash sources and uses for the comparative periods are discussed in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below.
During 2021, our Wood Products and BMD locations continued to experience periodic short-term disruptions due to COVID-19 as we continued efforts to increase production rates and distribution capabilities in response to strong end-product demand. Furthermore, supply-side constraints across product lines including shortages of materials, labor, and transportation resources limited the industry's ability to meet underlying demand. The effects of the COVID-19 vaccine and COVID-19 safety protocols helped slow pandemic-related disruptions at times; however, COVID-19 variants continue to spread throughout the United States, causing more short-term disruptions as we entered 2022. We continue to conduct business with certain modifications to mill and distribution center housekeeping and cleanliness protocols, employee travel, employee work locations, and virtualization or cancellation of certain sales and marketing events, among other modifications. In addition, we continue to actively monitor evolving developments, including the impact of COVID-19 variants, and may take actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers, communities, and stockholders.
Economic uncertainty due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues. However, mortgage rate levels, continuation of work-from-home practices by many in the economy, and demographics in the U.S. have created a favorable demand environment for new residential construction, which we expect to continue in 2022. As of February 2022, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators consensus forecast for 2022 single- and multi-family housing starts in the U.S. was 1.60 million units, compared with actual housing starts of 1.60 million in 2021 and 1.38 million in 2020, as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau. In addition, limited new and existing home inventory availability and the age of the U.S. housing stock will continue to provide a favorable backdrop for residential construction and repair-and-remodel spending. Although we believe that current U.S. demographics support the higher level of forecasted housing starts, and many national home builders are reporting strong near-term backlogs, labor shortages and supply induced constraints on residential construction activity may continue to extend build times and limit activity. In addition, the pace of residential construction and repair-and-modeling activity may be affected by the economic impact of the cost of building materials and construction, housing affordability, mortgage interest rates, wage growth, prospective home buyers' access to financing, consumer confidence, as well as other factors.
As a manufacturer of certain commodity products, we have sales and profitability exposure to declines in commodity product prices and rising input costs. Our distribution business purchases and sells a broad mix of commodity products with periods of increasing prices providing the opportunity for higher sales and increased margins, while declining price environments expose us to declines in sales and profitability. Our 2021 results were favorably impacted by historically high commodity wood products pricing, as well as rising prices for EWP and general line products. Composite lumber and panel prices were very volatile throughout 2021 with rapidly rising prices in second quarter, sharp price declines in third quarter, and prices steadily increasing again during fourth quarter. As we enter 2022, commodity wood products pricing continues to be above historical averages as strong demand and capacity constraints continue to create supply/demand imbalances in the marketplace. We expect future commodity product pricing and commodity input costs to be volatile in response to capacity restoration and industry operating rates, the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on residential construction, net import and export activity, transportation constraints or disruptions, inventory levels in various distribution channels, and seasonal demand patterns. EWP and general line products have historically experienced limited price volatility, and we expect the firm pricing environment to continue in 2022.
Factors That Affect Our Operating Results and Trends
Our results of operations and financial performance are influenced by a variety of factors, including: (i) the commodity nature of the products we manufacture and distribute; (ii) general economic and industry conditions affecting demand; and (iii) cost and availability of raw materials, including wood fiber and glues and resins. These factors have historically produced cyclicality in our results of operations, and we expect this cyclicality to continue in future periods.
Commodity Nature of Our Products
Many of the building products we manufacture or distribute, including OSB, plywood, and lumber, are commodities that are widely available from other manufacturers or distributors with prices and volumes determined frequently in an auction market based on participants' perceptions of short-term supply and demand factors. At times, the price for any one or more of the products we produce or distribute may fall below our cash production or purchase costs, requiring us to either incur short-term losses on product sales or cease production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities. Therefore, our profitability with respect to these commodity products depends, in significant part, on effective facilities maintenance programs, and on managing our cost structure, particularly raw materials and labor, which represent the largest components of our operating costs. Composite structural panel and lumber prices have been volatile historically.
The following table provides changes in the average composite panel, including certain panel subcategories, and average composite lumber prices as reflected by Random Lengths, an industry publication, for the periods noted below. In addition to the year-over-year average price changes, 2021 and 2020 were years of exceptional price volatility when compared to historical results.
In our Wood Products segment, we manufacture plywood, but not OSB, and therefore our reported prices may not trend with the overall composite panel price index. Our BMD segment purchases and resells a broad mix of commodity products with periods of increasing prices providing the opportunity for higher sales and increased margins, while declining price environments may result in declines in sales and profitability. For further discussion of the impact of commodity prices on historical periods, see "Our Operating Results" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
General Economic and Industry Conditions Affecting Demand
The level of housing starts is especially important to our results of operations. New residential construction activity has historically been volatile with demand influenced by several economic conditions, including domestic population growth, immigration rates, residential vacancy and foreclosure rates, demand for second homes, and existing home prices. The pace of household formation rates and residential repair-and-remodeling activity will also be affected by the economic impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, employment levels, demographic trends, wage growth, housing affordability, availability of construction labor, materials, and building lots, prospective home buyers' access to financing, consumer confidence, as well as other factors. Improved household formation rates in turn will help stimulate new construction. In addition, the size of new single-family residences as well as the mix of single and multi-family starts will influence product consumption. Increases in EWP demand will be highly influenced by single-family housing starts.
Industry supply for the products we produce and distribute is influenced primarily by price-induced changes in the operating rates of existing facilities, but is also influenced over time by the introduction of new product technologies, capacity additions and closures, restart of idled capacity, and log availability. The balance of supply and demand in the U.S. is also heavily influenced by imported products, principally from Canada and South America.
We believe that our product line diversification provides us some protection from declines in new residential construction. Our products are used not only in new residential construction, but also in residential repair-and-remodeling
projects. We believe the overall age of the U.S. housing stock, resales of existing homes, increased focus on making homes more energy efficient, rising home prices, and availability of consumer loans at low interest rates will continue to support long-term growth in repair-and-remodeling expenditures and increased demand through home improvement centers and our other customers that service professional contractors.
Cost and Availability of Raw Materials
Our principal raw material is wood fiber, which accounted for approximately 45% of the aggregate amount of materials, labor, and other operating expenses (excluding depreciation), for our Wood Products segment in 2021. Logs comprised approximately 66% of our wood fiber costs during 2021, and we satisfy our log requirements through a combination of purchases under supply agreements, open-market purchases, and purchases pursuant to contracts awarded under public auctions.
The following table provides changes in our average per-unit log costs for the periods noted below:
Our log requirements and our access to supply, as well as the cost of obtaining logs, are subject to change based on, among other things, the availability of logs in each of our operating areas, our operating schedules, competition from other manufacturers, the effect of governmental laws and regulations, impacts of weather or fire on log availability, and the status of environmental appeals. Per-unit log costs in the western U.S. are higher than per-unit log costs in the southern U.S. due to higher harvest and delivery costs, as well as various supply-side constraints, including seasonal weather-related restrictions, slower growth cycles, and a higher proportion of federal and state timberland ownership. Our aggregate cost of obtaining logs is also affected by fuel costs and the distance of the log source from our facilities, as we are often required to arrange for harvesting and delivery of the logs we purchase from the source to our facilities.
We also purchase OSB, which is used as the vertical web to assemble I-joists. OSB accounted for approximately 9% of the aggregate amount of materials, labor, and other operating expenses (excluding depreciation) for our Wood Products segment in 2021. OSB is a commodity, and prices have been historically volatile in response to industry capacity and operating rates, the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on residential construction, net import and export activity, transportation constraints or disruptions, inventory levels in various distribution channels, and seasonal demand patterns.
Wood fiber also includes, to a lesser extent than OSB, lumber purchased from third parties for I-joist production at our Canadian EWP facility and for production at our laminated beam plant in Idaho. Lumber input costs are subject to similar commodity-based volatility characteristics noted above for OSB.
We also use various resins and glues in our manufacturing processes, which accounted for approximately 5% of the aggregate amount of materials, labor, and other operating expenses (excluding depreciation) for our Wood Products segment in 2021. The costs of resins and glues are influenced by changes in the prices of raw material input costs, primarily fossil fuel products.
We purchase many of our raw materials through long-term contracts that contain price adjustment mechanisms that take into account changes in market prices. Therefore, although our long-term contracts provide us with supplies of raw materials and energy that are more stable than open-market purchases, in many cases, they may not alleviate fluctuations in market prices.

2021 Compared With 2020
Sales
For the year ended December 31, 2021, total sales increased $2,451.3 million, or 45%, to $7,926.1 million from $5,474.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. As described below, the increase in sales was driven by the changes in sales prices and volumes for the products we manufacture and distribute with single-family residential construction activity being the key demand driver for our sales. During 2021, U.S. housing starts increased 16%, with single-family starts up 14%, compared with 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, average composite panel and average composite lumber prices were 84% and 49% higher, respectively, compared with the same period in the prior year, as reflected by Random Lengths composite panel and lumber pricing. These increases in composite commodity pricing, as well as price increases across EWP and general line products, resulted in higher sales in both of our segments, as noted below.
Wood Products. During the year ended December 31, 2021, sales, including sales to our BMD segment, increased $646.9 million, or 49%, to $1,970.8 million from $1,323.9 million in 2020. The increase in sales was driven by higher plywood prices of 75%, resulting in increased sales of $326.5 million. Higher sales prices for I-joists and LVL (collectively referred to as EWP) of 22% and 19%, respectively, resulted in increased sales of $78.3 million and $63.1 million, respectively. The increase in EWP pricing was due to realizations of previously announced price increases and certain temporary price protection arrangements expiring in the current year. In addition, sales volumes for I-joists and LVL increased 21% and 5%, respectively, resulting in increased sales of $61.8 million and $16.2 million, respectively. Improved lumber sales prices and plywood sales volumes of 70% and 1%, respectively, contributed $33.2 million and $2.1 million, respectively, to the increase in sales. In addition, laminated beam and OSB rimboard sales, collectively, increased by approximately $39 million.
Building Materials Distribution. During the year ended December 31, 2021, sales increased $2,222.3 million, or 45%, to $7,174.3 million from $4,952.0 million in 2020. Compared with the prior year, the overall increase in sales was driven by sales price and sales volume increases of 42% and 3%, respectively. By product line, commodity sales increased 60%, or $1,394.8 million, general line product sales increased 23%, or $402.7 million, and sales of EWP (substantially all of which is sourced through our Wood Products segment) increased 48%, or $424.8 million.
Costs and Expenses
Materials, labor, and other operating expenses (excluding depreciation) increased $1,764.0 million, or 39%, to $6,300.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with $4,536.1 million during the prior year. In our Wood Products segment, materials, labor, and other operating expenses increased due to higher EWP sales volumes, as well as higher per-unit costs of OSB (used in the manufacture of I-joists) and logs of approximately 17% and 14%, compared with 2020. However, materials, labor, and other operating expenses as a percentage of sales (MLO rate) in our Wood Products segment decreased by 1,360 basis points, which was primarily due to higher plywood, EWP, and lumber sales prices, resulting in improved leveraging of labor cost, wood fiber costs, and other manufacturing costs. In BMD, the increase in materials, labor, and other operating expenses was driven primarily by higher purchased materials costs as a result of higher prices, as well as a 20 basis point increase in the MLO rate, compared with 2020. Our BMD MLO rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was negatively impacted by a sharp decline in commodity prices during the third quarter of 2021, offset partially by improved gross margin percentages on our EWP and general line sales.
Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $14.4 million, or 15%, to $80.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with $95.2 million during the prior year. The decrease was due primarily to recording accelerated depreciation of $15.0 million in first quarter 2020 to fully depreciate the curtailed I-joist production assets at our Roxboro, North Carolina facility, offset partially by an increase in purchases of property and equipment. For additional information, see Note 6, Curtailment of Manufacturing Facility, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.
Selling and distribution expenses increased $62.7 million, or 15%, to $491.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with $428.3 million for the prior year. The increase was due primarily to higher employee-related expenses, including base pay increases, special bonuses, and sales and incentive compensation, of $42.5 million, as well as higher shipping and handling costs and occupancy expenses of $8.9 million and $5.1 million, respectively.
General and administrative expenses increased $4.6 million, or 6%, to $83.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with $78.6 million for the prior year. The increase was due primarily to higher employee-related expenses of $4.0 million.
Loss on curtailment of facility of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, represents various closure-related costs due to the permanent curtailment of I-joist production at our Roxboro, North Carolina, facility. For additional information, see Note 6, Curtailment of Manufacturing Facility, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.
Income From Operations
Income from operations increased $636.8 million to $971.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with $335.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Wood Products. For the year ended December 31, 2021, segment income increased $403.5 million to $531.2 million from $127.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in segment income was due primarily to higher plywood, EWP, and lumber sales prices, as well as higher EWP sales volumes. In addition, 2020 results included accelerated depreciation of $15.0 million and other closure-related costs of $1.7 million at our Roxboro, North Carolina facility. These increases were offset partially by higher wood fiber costs and other manufacturing costs. In addition, selling and distribution expenses and general and administrative expenses increased $2.4 million and $0.6 million, respectively.
Building Materials Distribution. For the year ended December 31, 2021, segment income increased $233.6 million to $481.1 million from $247.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in segment income was driven by a gross margin increase of $296.8 million, resulting from improved gross margins across our EWP, general line, and commodity product categories compared with 2020. The improvement was offset partially by increased selling and distribution expenses and general and administrative expenses of $60.6 million and $2.9 million, respectively.
Corporate. Unallocated corporate expenses increased $0.3 million to $40.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $40.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due primarily to higher employee-related expenses, offset partially by lower self-insurance losses during 2021.
Other
Pension expense (excluding service costs). In December 2020, we eliminated our qualified defined benefit pension plan (Pension Plan). The process of eliminating the Pension Plan included lump-sum payments made to eligible plan participants at their election and the purchase of a buy-out group annuity contract (Buy-Out) from The Prudential Insurance Company of America (Prudential), which was funded with plan assets. When the Buy-Out became effective on December 31, 2020, we irrevocably transferred to Prudential the future benefit obligations and annuity administration for all remaining plan participants (or their beneficiaries) in the Pension Plan. These transactions fully eliminated the liabilities of our Pension Plan, resulting in a non-cash settlement charge of $6.2 million in fourth quarter 2020. For additional information related to our Pension Plan, see Note 11, Retirement and Benefit Plans, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.
Change in fair value of interest rate swaps. For information related to our interest rate swaps, see the discussion under "Disclosures of Financial Market Risks" and "Financial Instruments" included in this "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Form 10-K.
Loss on extinguishment of debt. In connection with the issuance of the $400 million of 4.875% senior notes due July 1, 2030 (2030 Notes), we commenced a tender offer to purchase any and all of our $350 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due September 1, 2024 (2024 Notes) then outstanding. On July 27, 2020, we accepted for purchase an aggregate principal amount of $212.5 million of the 2024 Notes that were tendered. On September 1, 2020, we redeemed the remaining $137.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes outstanding. In connection with these transactions, we recognized a pre-tax loss on the extinguishment of debt of $14.0 million during 2020. The loss includes $10.8 million in debt extinguishment premium payments and $3.2 million for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. For more information related to our indebtedness, see Note 9, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.
2020 Compared With 2019
Sales
For the year ended December 31, 2020, total sales increased $831.4 million, or 18%, to $5,474.8 million from $4,643.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. As described below, the increase in sales was driven by the
changes in sales prices and volumes for the products we manufacture and distribute with single-family residential construction activity being the key demand driver of our sales. During 2020, U.S. housing starts increased 7%, with single-family starts up 12%, compared with 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, average composite lumber and average composite panel prices were 57% and 54% higher, respectively, compared with the same period in the prior year, as reflected by Random Lengths composite lumber and panel pricing. These increases in composite commodity pricing resulted in higher sales in both of our segments, as noted below.
Wood Products. During the year ended December 31, 2020, sales, including sales to our BMD segment, increased $48.7 million, or 4%, to $1,323.9 million from $1,275.2 million in 2019. The increase in sales was driven primarily by higher plywood prices of 30%, resulting in increased sales of $101.0 million. In addition, higher sales volumes for I-joists of 6% resulted in increased sales of $18.1 million. These increases were offset partially by lower sales volumes for plywood and LVL of 6% and 3%, respectively, resulting in decreased sales of $22.4 million and $10.4 million, respectively. The lower volume for plywood sales reflects our continued work to optimize veneer into EWP production, as well as periodic short-term disruptions related to COVID-19. Net sales prices for LVL and I-joists each decreased 2%, resulting in decreased sales of $6.9 million and $6.2 million, respectively. In addition, other sales, including by-products, freight, and logs, decreased compared with the prior year period.
Building Materials Distribution. During the year ended December 31, 2020, sales increased $814.3 million, or 20%, to $4,952.0 million from $4,137.7 million in 2019. Compared with the prior year, the overall increase in sales was driven by sales price and sales volume increases of 13% and 7%, respectively. By product line, commodity sales increased 34%, or $584.4 million, general line product sales increased 11%, or $181.7 million, and sales of EWP (substantially all of which is sourced through our Wood Products segment) increased 6%, or $48.2 million.
Costs and Expenses
Materials, labor, and other operating expenses (excluding depreciation) increased $570.3 million, or 14%, to $4,536.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with $3,965.8 million during the prior year. In our Wood Products segment, materials, labor, and other operating expenses decreased, due to lower sales volumes, offset partially by higher per-unit costs of OSB (used in the manufacture of I-joists) of 36%, compared with 2019. The MLO rate in our Wood Products segment decreased by 640 basis points, which was primarily due to higher plywood sales prices, resulting in improved leveraging of manufacturing costs, including labor and wood fiber costs. In BMD, the increase in materials, labor, and other operating expenses was driven by higher purchased materials costs as a result of higher commodity prices and higher sales volumes, compared with 2019. However, the BMD segment MLO rate improved 140 basis points compared with 2019 due primarily to improved gross margin percentages for our commodity product sales, driven by an increasing commodity price environment during the majority of 2020.
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $15.0 million, or 19%, to $95.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with $80.1 million during the prior year. The increase was due primarily to recording accelerated depreciation of $15.0 million in first quarter 2020 to fully depreciate the curtailed I-joist production assets at our Roxboro, North Carolina facility. For additional information, see Note 6, Curtailment of Manufacturing Facility, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.
Selling and distribution expenses increased $37.5 million, or 10%, to $428.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with $390.7 million for the prior year. The increase was due primarily to higher employee-related expenses, mostly incentive compensation, of $34.0 million, as well as higher shipping and handling costs of $3.3 million. These increases were offset partially by lower travel and entertainment expenses of $5.7 million.
General and administrative expenses increased $7.6 million, or 11%, to $78.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with $71.1 million for the prior year. The increase was due primarily to higher employee-related expenses, mostly incentive compensation, of $11.8 million, offset partially by lower travel and entertainment expenses of $2.2 million and other discretionary expenses.
For more information related to our loss on curtailment of facility during 2020, reference the discussion above, "2021 Compared With 2020."
Income From Operations
Income from operations increased $198.6 million to $335.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with $136.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Wood Products. For the year ended December 31, 2020, segment income increased $73.5 million to $127.7 million from $54.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in segment income was due primarily to higher plywood sales prices, as well as higher I-joist sales volumes and lower manufacturing costs. These improvements were offset partially by accelerated depreciation of $15.0 million and other closure-related costs of $1.7 million at our Roxboro, North Carolina facility, as well as lower EWP prices and higher wood fiber costs. In addition, selling and distribution expenses and general and administrative expenses increased $1.9 million and $0.6 million, respectively.
Building Materials Distribution. For the year ended December 31, 2020, segment income increased $131.3 million to
$247.5 million from $116.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in segment income was driven by a gross margin increase of $173.0 million, resulting primarily from improved gross margins on commodity products, as well as higher sales of general line products compared with 2019. The margin improvement was offset partially by increased selling and distribution expenses and general and administrative expenses of $35.7 million and $4.2 million, respectively.
Corporate. Unallocated corporate expenses increased $6.2 million to $40.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due primarily to higher incentive compensation and business interruption losses. As part of our self-insured risk retention program, corporate absorbed approximately $3.5 million of estimated business interruption losses at Wood Products facilities in 2020. The losses resulted from downtime at our Louisiana manufacturing facilities due to hurricanes and from a fire-related production disruption at our Chester, South Carolina, plywood plant.
Other
Pension expense (excluding service costs). We recognized a non-cash pension settlement charge of $6.2 million in fourth quarter 2020. For more information, reference the discussion above, "2021 Compared With 2020."
On September 30, 2019, we transferred $19.8 million of our Pension Plan assets to Prudential for the purchase of a group annuity contract. Under the arrangement, Prudential assumed ongoing responsibility for administration and benefit payments for approximately 10% of our U.S. qualified pension plan projected benefit obligations at the time of the transaction. As a result of the transaction, we recognized a non-cash settlement charge of $1.3 million in third quarter 2019.

Income Tax Provision
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we recorded $236.4 million, $111.3 million, and $27.3 million, respectively, of income tax expense and had an effective rate of 24.9%, 38.9%, and 25.2%, respectively. Our rate is affected by recurring items, such as state income taxes, and discrete items that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the primary reason for the difference between the federal statutory income tax rate of 21% and the effective tax rate was a $35.7 million increase in income tax expense, or an effect of 3.8%, from state income taxes.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the primary reasons for the difference between the federal statutory income tax rate of 21% and the effective tax rate were the effect of the following:
•A $38.8 million increase in income tax expense, or an effect of 13.5%, from the required release of stranded tax effects upon elimination of our Pension Plan in December 2020 (Plan Termination). For additional information related to the Plan Termination and the related release of stranded tax effects, see Note 4, Income Taxes, and Note 11, Retirement
and Benefit Plans, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.
•A $12.3 million increase in income tax expense, or an effect of 4.3%, from state income taxes.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the primary reasons for the difference between the federal statutory income tax rate of 21% and the effective tax rate were the effect of the following:
•A $4.4 million increase in income tax expense, or an effect of 4.1%, from state income taxes.
•A $1.7 million increase in income tax expense, or an effect of 1.6%, from permanent differences, including meals and entertainment and nondeductible executive compensation.
•A $1.3 million reduction in income tax expense, or an effect of 1.2%, from tax credits and excess tax benefits of share-based payment awards.
Industry Mergers and Acquisitions
On August 27, 2020, Builders FirstSource, Inc. (BFS) and BMC Stock Holdings (BMC) announced a definitive merger agreement. The merger closed in early January 2021. Prior to the merger, BFS and BMC were both customers of ours. We believe we have a good relationship with the combined company and the transaction has not, and we do not expect it to have, a material impact on our future results of operations. The merger resulted in the combined company accounting for 20% of total receivables as of December 31, 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We ended 2021 with $748.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $444.6 million of debt. At December 31, 2021, we had $1,094.9 million of available liquidity (cash and cash equivalents and undrawn committed bank line availability). Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $343.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, as cash provided by operations was offset partially by capital spending, dividends paid on our common stock, and tax withholding payments on stock-based awards, as further discussed below.
At December 31, 2021, our cash was invested in high-quality, short-term investments, which we record in "Cash and cash equivalents." The majority of our cash and cash equivalents is comprised of money market funds that are broadly diversified and invested in high-quality, short-duration securities, including commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. government agency securities, and similar instruments. We have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents that are in excess of federally insured limits. Though we have not experienced any losses on our cash and cash equivalents to date and we do not anticipate incurring any losses, we cannot be assured that we will not experience losses on our short-term investments.
We believe that our cash flows from operations, combined with our current cash levels and available borrowing capacity, will be adequate to fund debt service requirements and provide cash, as required, to support our ongoing operations, capital expenditures, lease obligations, working capital, income tax payments, and to pay cash dividends to holders of our common stock over the next 12 months. We expect to fund our seasonal and intra-month working capital requirements in 2022 from cash on hand and, if necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Consistent with our historical patterns, we expect working capital increases to use cash in the first quarter of 2022.
Sources and Uses of Cash
We generate cash primarily from sales of our products, as well as short-term and long-term borrowings. Our primary uses of cash are for expenses related to the manufacture and distribution of building products, including inventory purchased for resale, wood fiber, labor, energy, and glues and resins. In addition to paying for ongoing operating costs, we use cash to invest in our business, service our debt and lease obligations, and return cash to our shareholders through dividends or common stock repurchases. Below is a discussion of our sources and uses of cash for operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.
Operating Activities
2021 Compared With 2020
In 2021, our operating activities generated $667.0 million of cash, compared with $294.5 million in 2020. The $372.5 million increase in cash provided by operations in 2021 relates primarily to the following:
•A $403.5 million increase in income in our Wood Products segment and a $233.6 million increase in income in our BMD segment. See "Operating Results" above for a discussion on our results for 2021.
•A decrease in cash contributions to our pension plans of $12.3 million. During 2021, we used $0.5 million of cash to make pension contributions to the nonqualified plan participants, compared with $12.8 million of pension contributions to the qualified and nonqualified plans during 2020.
•A $185.0 million increase in cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds. During 2021, cash paid for taxes, net of refunds received was $260.1 million, compared to $75.1 million in 2020. The increase in cash paid for income taxes is primarily due to an increase in income from operations.
•A $109.2 million increase in working capital during 2021, compared with a $35.7 million increase in working capital during 2020. Working capital is subject to cyclical operating needs, seasonal buying patterns for inventory purchased for resale and logs, the timing of the collection of receivables, and the timing of payment of payables and expenses. The increase in working capital in 2021 was primarily attributable to higher receivables and inventories, offset partially by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The increase in receivables in 2021 primarily reflects increased sales of approximately 20%, comparing sales for the month of December 2021 with sales for the month of December 2020. Inventories increased in 2021 primarily due to increased cost of inventory purchased for resale and higher production costs for our manufactured products. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in 2021 was related to the increase in inventories and higher accrued rebates as of December 31, 2021. The increase in working capital in 2020 was primarily attributable to higher receivables and inventories, offset partially by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The increase in receivables in 2020 primarily reflects increased sales of approximately 55%, comparing sales for the month of December 2020 with sales for the month of December 2019. Inventories increased in 2020 primarily due to an increase in finished goods inventory in our BMD segment. However, inventories in our Wood Products segment decreased in 2020 due to strong product demand, lower log inventory, and reduced production levels as a result of periodic short-term disruptions at many locations due to COVID-19. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in 2020 was greater than the 2019 increase, reflecting the increase in inventories as of December 31, 2020, and higher incentive compensation accruals.
2020 Compared With 2019
In 2020, our operating activities generated $294.5 million of cash, compared with $245.6 million in 2019. The $48.9 million increase in cash provided by operations in 2020 relates primarily to the following:
•A $131.3 million increase in income in our BMD segment and a $73.5 million increase in income in our Wood Products segment. See "Operating Results" above for a discussion on our results for 2020.
•A $35.7 million increase in working capital during 2020, compared with a $47.4 million decrease in working capital during 2019. Working capital is subject to cyclical operating needs, seasonal buying patterns for inventory purchased for resale and logs, the timing of the collection of receivables, and the timing of payment of payables and expenses. The increase in working capital in 2020 was primarily attributable to higher receivables and inventories, offset partially by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The increase in receivables in 2020 primarily reflects increased sales of approximately 55%, comparing sales for the month of December 2020 with sales for the month of December 2019. Inventories increased in 2020 primarily due to an increase in finished goods inventory in our BMD segment. However, inventories in our Wood Products segment decreased in 2020 due to strong product demand, lower log inventory, and reduced production levels as a result of periodic short-term disruptions at many locations due to COVID-19. The decrease in working capital in 2019 was primarily attributable to decreased inventories and higher accounts payable. Inventories decreased in 2019, particularly in our BMD segment, as a result of weaker commodity pricing during the period. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in 2020 was greater than the 2019 increase, reflecting the increase in inventories as of December 31, 2020, and higher incentive compensation accruals.
•A $76.5 million increase in cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds. During 2020, cash paid for taxes, net of refunds received was $75.1, compared to income tax refunds received, net of taxes paid of $1.4 million in 2019. The increase in cash paid for income taxes is primarily due to an increase in income from operations.
•An increase in cash contributions to our pension plans of $7.5 million. During 2020, we used $12.8 million of cash to make pension contributions, compared with $5.2 million during 2019.
Investment Activities
Net cash used for investing activities was $105.6 million, $78.7 million, and $94.1 million during 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we used approximately $106.5 million of cash for purchases of property and equipment, which included business improvement and quality/efficiency projects, replacement and expansion projects, and ongoing environmental compliance. Quality and efficiency projects include quality improvements, modernization, energy, and cost-saving projects. Included in our 2021 capital spending is the completion of a log utilization center project at our Florien, Louisiana, plywood and veneer plant, a new door assembly operation in Houston, Texas, the expansion of our distribution capabilities in the Nashville market, the purchase of a BMD property in Walton, Kentucky, that expands our service capabilities in the Cincinnati and surrounding markets, and the purchase of a previously leased BMD property in Saco, Maine. Purchases of property and equipment also included approximately $3 million for environmental compliance in 2021, and we expect to spend approximately $4 million in environmental compliance related spending in 2022.
Excluding potential acquisitions, we expect capital expenditures in 2022 to total approximately $110 million to $130 million. We expect our capital spending in 2022 will be for business improvement and quality/efficiency projects, replacement and expansion projects, and ongoing environmental compliance. Our 2022 capital expenditures range includes funding to complete our recently announced BMD organic expansions in Ohio, Kentucky, and Minnesota, and a new dryer at our Chester, South Carolina veneer and plywood plant. This level of capital expenditures could increase or decrease as a result of a number of factors, including acquisitions, efforts to further accelerate organic growth, exercise of lease purchase options, our financial results, future economic conditions, availability of engineering and construction resources, and timing and availability of equipment purchases.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we used approximately $79.4 million of cash for purchases of property and equipment, which included business improvement and quality/efficiency projects, replacement and expansion projects, and ongoing environmental compliance. Quality and efficiency projects include quality improvements, modernization, energy, and cost-saving projects. In 2020, purchases of property and equipment included approximately $1 million for environmental compliance.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we used approximately $82.7 million of cash for purchases of property and equipment, which included business improvement and quality/efficiency projects, replacement and expansion projects, and ongoing environmental compliance. Quality and efficiency projects include quality improvements, modernization, energy, and cost-saving projects. In 2019, purchases of property and equipment included approximately $2 million for environmental compliance. In addition, we used $15.7 million for the acquisition of a wholesale building materials distribution location in Birmingham, Alabama. For additional information related to the acquisition of the distribution facility, see Note 7, Acquisitions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we received asset sales proceeds of $2.5 million, from the sale of a hardwood plywood facility located in Moncure, North Carolina.
Financing Activities
During 2021, our financing activities used $217.9 million of cash, including $213.7 million for common stock dividend payments and $2.7 million of tax withholding payments on stock-based awards. See "Dividends on Common Stock" below for further discussion of common stock dividend payments. During 2021, we also borrowed $28.0 million under our revolving credit facility, which were subsequently repaid during the same period with cash on hand. At December 31, 2021, we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
During 2020, our financing activities used $95.7 million of cash. On July 27, 2020, we issued $400 million of 2030 Notes. With proceeds from the 2030 Notes issuance, we retired our $350 million of 2024 Notes and paid-off our American AgCredit term loan of $45.0 million. In connection with the retirement of the 2024 Notes, we made debt extinguishment premium payments of $10.8 million. During 2020, our financing activities also used $79.2 million for common stock dividend payments, $6.2 million for financing costs related to the 2030 Notes, and $3.3 million of tax withholding payments on stock-based awards. At December 31, 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
During 2019, our financing activities used $58.0 million of cash, including $54.0 million for common stock dividend payments and $3.6 million of tax withholding payments on stock-based awards. During 2019, we borrowed $5.5 million under our revolving credit facility to fund intra-month working capital needs, which were subsequently repaid during the same period with cash on hand. At December 31, 2019, we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
Debt Structure
For information related to our debt transactions and debt structure, see Note 9, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.
Dividends on Common Stock
On November 14, 2017, our board of directors approved a dividend policy to pay quarterly cash dividends to holders of our common stock. Future quarterly dividend declarations, including amount per share, record date and payment date, will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other things, legal capital requirements and surplus, our future operations and earnings, general financial condition, material cash requirements, restrictions imposed by our asset-based credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes, applicable laws, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. For a description of the restrictions in our asset-based credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes on our ability to pay dividends, see Note 9, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. The dividend policy may be suspended or canceled at the discretion of the board of directors at any time.
For more information regarding our dividend declarations and payments made during 2021, 2020, and 2019, see Note 13, Stockholders' Equity, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.
Stock Repurchase Program
For information related to our stock repurchases, see Note 13, Stockholders' Equity, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.
Other Material Cash Requirements
Long-term Debt and Interest
As of December 31, 2021, we had long-term debt with varying maturities totaling an aggregate principal of $450.0 million, with no principal payments required within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the long-term debt total $177.0 million, with $20.0 million payable within 12 months. Long-term debt and interest amounts assume our debt is held to maturity. For more information, see Note 9, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.
Leases
We enter into various operating and finance leases for our distribution centers, as well as other property and equipment. As of December 31, 2021, our minimum lease payments for operating leases were $82.7 million, with $14.3 million of lease payments required within 12 months. As of December 31, 2021, our minimum lease payments for finance leases were $56.2 million, with $4.0 million of lease payments required within 12 months. Some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property. The lease term includes any renewal option periods we are reasonably certain of exercising. Our operating and finance lease obligations could change based on whether we actually exercise these renewal options and/or if we entered into additional lease agreements. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Polices, and Note 10, Leases, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.
Purchase Obligations for Raw Materials
As of December 31, 2021, we have contracts to purchase approximately $190 million of logs, approximately $42 million of which will be purchased pursuant to fixed-price contracts and approximately $148 million of which will be purchased pursuant to variable-price contracts. The $148 million is estimated using current contractual index pricing, but actual prices depend on future market prices. We are required to purchase approximately $46 million of logs within 12 months. Under certain log agreements, we have the right to cancel or reduce our commitments in the event of a mill curtailment or shutdown. Future purchase prices under most of the variable-price agreements will be set quarterly or semiannually based on regional market prices. Our log requirements and our access to supply, as well as the cost of obtaining logs, are subject to change based on, among other things, the effect of governmental laws and regulations, our manufacturing operations not operating in the normal course of business, log availability, and the status of environmental appeals. Except for deposits required pursuant to log supply contracts, these obligations are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements until contract payment terms take effect.
Guarantees
Note 9, Debt, and Note 17, Commitments, Legal Proceedings and Contingencies, and Guarantees, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K describe the nature of our guarantees, including the approximate terms of the guarantees, how the guarantees arose, the events or circumstances that would require us to perform under the guarantees, and the maximum potential undiscounted amounts of future payments we could be required to make.
Seasonal Influences
We are exposed to fluctuations in quarterly sales volumes and expenses due to seasonal factors. These seasonal factors are common in the building products industry. Seasonal changes in levels of building activity affect our building products businesses, which are dependent on housing starts, repair-and-remodeling activities, and light commercial construction activities. We typically report lower sales volumes in the first and fourth quarters due to the impact of poor weather on the construction market, and we generally have higher sales volumes in the second and third quarters, reflecting an increase in construction due to more favorable weather conditions. We typically have higher working capital in the first and second quarters in preparation and response to the building season. Seasonally cold weather increases costs, especially energy consumption costs, at most of our manufacturing facilities.
Disclosures of Financial Market Risks
In the normal course of business, we are exposed to financial risks such as changes in commodity prices, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates. In 2021, 2020, and 2019, we did not use derivative instruments to manage these risks, except for interest rate swaps as discussed below.
Commodity Price Risk
Many of the products we manufacture or purchase and resell and some of our key production inputs are commodities whose price is determined by the market's supply and demand for such products. Price fluctuations in our selling prices and key costs have a significant effect on our financial performance. The markets for most of these commodities are cyclical and are primarily affected by various economic and industry factors, including industry operating rates, the impact of COVID-19 on residential construction, net import and export activity, changes in or disruptions to industry production capacity, transportation constraints or disruptions, changes in inventory levels, and other factors beyond our control. For further discussion of commodity price risk, refer to "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Form 10-K and "Factors That Affect Our Operating Results and Trends" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in variable-rate LIBOR on our term loan and when we have loan amounts outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2021, we had $50.0 million of variable-rate debt outstanding based on one-month LIBOR. Our objective is to limit the variability of interest payments on our debt. To meet this objective, we enter into receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps to change the variable-rate cash flow exposure to fixed-rate cash flows. In accordance with our risk management strategy, we actively monitor our interest rate exposure and use derivative instruments from time to time to manage the related risk. We do not speculate using derivative instruments.
At December 31, 2021, we had two interest rate swap agreements. Under the interest rate swaps, we receive one-month LIBOR-based variable interest rate payments and make fixed interest rate payments, thereby fixing the interest rate on $50.0 million of variable rate debt exposure. Payments on one interest rate swap, entered into in 2016, with a notional principal amount of $50.0 million are due on a monthly basis at an annual fixed rate of 1.007%, and this swap expires in February 2022 (Initial Swap). During second quarter 2020, we entered into another forward interest rate swap agreement which commences on the expiration date of the Initial Swap. Payments on this interest rate swap with a notional principal amount of $50.0 million will be due on a monthly basis at an annual fixed rate of 0.39%, and this swap expires in June 2025.
The interest rate swap agreements were not designated as cash flow hedges, and as a result, all changes in the fair value are recognized in "Change in fair value of interest rate swaps" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations rather than through other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2021, we recorded a long-term asset of $1.2 million in "Other assets" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and we also recorded a long-term liability of $0.1 million in "Other long-term liabilities" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, representing the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2020, we recorded a long-term liability of $0.6 million in "Other long-term liabilities" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, representing the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements. The swaps were valued based on observable inputs for similar assets and liabilities and other observable inputs for interest rates and yield curves (Level 2 inputs).
Foreign Currency Risk
We have sales in countries outside the U.S. As a result, we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in Canada, but we do not believe our exposure to currency fluctuations is significant.
Financial Instruments
The table below provides information as of December 31, 2021, about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For obligations with variable interest rate sensitivity, the table sets forth payout amounts based on December 31, 2021 rates and does not attempt to project future rates.
_______________________________________
(a) These obligations are further explained in Note 9, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. The table assumes our long-term debt is held to maturity.
(b) We estimated the fair value using quoted market prices of our debt in inactive markets.
The table below provides information as of December 31, 2021, about our interest rate swaps. For information on interest rate swaps, see Interest Rate Risk and Interest Rate Swaps of Note 15, Financial Instrument Risk, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. The following is information about the notional amount and interest rate by contractual maturity date for our interest rate swap agreements, as well as the fair value at December 31, 2021:
_______________________________________
(a) We have one interest rate swap with a notional principal amount of $50.0 million that expires in February 2022 (Initial Swap). Another forward interest rate swap agreement commences on the expiration date of the Initial Swap and expires in June 2025.
(b) At December 31, 2021, we recorded a long-term asset of $1.2 million in "Other assets" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and we also recorded a long-term liability of $0.1 million.in "Other long-term liabilities" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, representing the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements.
(c) Represents the weighted average actual fixed interest rate payable on our interest rate swaps.
(d) Represents the weighted average variable interest rate receivable on our interest rate swaps at December 31, 2021.
Environmental
We are subject to a wide range of general and industry-specific environmental laws and regulations. In particular, we are affected by laws and regulations covering air emissions, wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous waste management, and site remediation. Compliance with these laws and regulations is a significant factor in the operation of our businesses. We believe that we have created a corporate culture of strong compliance by taking a conservative approach to environmental issues in order to assure that we are operating within the bounds of regulatory requirements. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be in compliance with environmental requirements at all times, and we cannot guarantee that we will not incur fines and penalties in the future. In 2021, we paid an insignificant amount in environmental fines and penalties.
We incur capital and operating expenditures to comply with federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or in enforcement actions. Our failure to comply could also result in governmental or judicial orders that stop or interrupt our operations or require us to take corrective measures, install additional pollution control equipment, or take other remedial actions. During 2021 and 2020, we spent approximately $3 million and $1 million, respectively, on capital expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. We expect to spend approximately $4 million in 2022 for this purpose.
As an owner and operator of real estate, we may be liable under environmental laws for the cleanup of past and present spills and releases of hazardous or toxic substances on or from our properties and operations. We may also be contractually obligated to indemnify third parties under environmental laws for the cleanup of past spills and releases of hazardous or toxic substances for properties which we no longer own and operate. We could be found liable under these laws whether or not we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of such substances. In some cases, this liability may exceed the value of the property itself.
In connection with prior transactions, certain third parties are generally obligated to indemnify us for hazardous substance releases and other environmental violations that occurred prior to such transactions. However, these third parties may not have sufficient funds to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations when required, and in some cases, we may not be contractually entitled to indemnification by them.
Climate Change
We source logs from responsibly managed working forests. Our log procurement practices are internally and third-party audited to meet the requirements of forest certification standards. When logs arrive at our facilities, they are processed into products that store carbon such as plywood, lumber and EWP. Bark and manufacturing residuals are used as biomass fuel, which allows us to generate the majority of the energy needed to manufacture our products. All manufacturing energy not derived from biomass is sourced from natural gas. None of our manufacturing facilities use coal or fuel oil as primary energy sources to manufacture products.
The use of our products is an energy efficient building choice, and when used in place of fossil fuel-intensive materials avoids greenhouse gases (GHG) that would have been emitted during manufacturing. We are assessing opportunities related to increased interest or demand for wood-based building materials due to their role in climate mitigation.
In recent years, various legislative and regulatory proposals to restrict GHG emissions, such as CO2, have been under consideration in state legislative bodies and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These proposals have included regulations to reduce GHG emissions from new and existing electric utilities, which may result in increased electricity and natural gas costs to our businesses. This impact may be partially mitigated, as the majority of the energy used to manufacture our products is generated from biomass fuel, which reduces our reliance on fossil fuels. There are currently no specific regulations that require our wood products plants to reduce GHG emissions, and the current EPA administration has not announced plans to develop such federal regulations.
States are taking various positions on climate change regulation. In 2021, Oregon adopted new regulations which required reduction of GHG emissions. The rules do not directly affect our facilities, but will likely result in increased natural gas, transportation fuel, and/or electricity costs. In 2021, Washington enacted new legislation establishing a cap and invest program intended to reduce GHG emissions, which may impact our operations by increasing natural gas, transportation fuel, and/or electricity costs. Our manufacturing operations in these states derive a significant amount of their energy from biomass fuel, a carbon neutral emission, which may not be directly regulated. However, changes in biomass fuel regulations may increase our costs for fuel and electricity. We are not aware of any plans to regulate GHG emissions by other states in which we have manufacturing operations. There are ongoing efforts by various organizations to encourage and/or require companies to
calculate, report, and reduce their carbon footprint. Furthermore, our customers may impose carbon footprint standards on their vendors, which may require us to incur additional costs associated with the evaluation and reduction of GHGs. Given the high degree of uncertainty about the ultimate parameters of any GHG regulatory initiatives, it is premature to make any prediction concerning such impacts.
Other Regulatory Initiatives
From time to time, legislative bodies and environmental regulatory agencies may promulgate new or revised regulatory programs imposing significant incremental operating costs or capital costs on us. In 2021, the EPA announced plans to reconsider both the Particulate Matter (PM) and ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). This review will likely result in more stringent PM and ozone NAAQS. It is too early to predict what NAAQS the EPA will establish and the specific impact to our facilities. However, any reduction in the NAAQS may require additional improvements to ensure compliance and may restrict our future growth due to emission limitations.
In 2016, our facilities began complying with the final Boiler Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) regulations, which regulate emissions of hazardous air pollutants from industrial boilers and process heaters. Following litigation of the standards, in 2020 the EPA proposed more stringent MACT emission standards for several types of boilers, including boilers common to our facilities. The EPA has not finalized those standards and therefore, the proposal remains subject to change. We expect our manufacturing facilities will meet the proposed limits, although certain of our boilers may require additional improvements to ensure continuous compliance. We continue to monitor and evaluate the EPA's revisions to the Boiler MACT emission limits.
Some of our wood products facilities are subject to the Plywood and Composite Wood Products (PCWP) MACT standards for hazardous air pollutants, and they have complied with these standards since 2007 or 2008. In August 2020, the EPA published its Risk and Technology Review (RTR) for PCWP MACT standards, which concluded additional controls were not required for PCWP sources. However, the RTR Rule did not address certain remanded sources, including plywood presses, lumber kilns, and various other emission sources at wood products manufacturing mills. Furthermore, soon after publication of the RTR Rule, an environmental organization filed a petition for reconsideration which the EPA has granted. The EPA has a court-ordered deadline to complete the revised rule by November 2023. It is expected that manufacturing facilities subject to PCWP MACT standards will have three years after publication of the revised rule for compliance. At this time we are unable to predict the impact of the revised final rules to our business.
The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) Cleaner Air Oregon (CAO) rules regulate toxic air emissions from manufacturing facilities located in Oregon. The rules are risk-based, and in March 2019, the ODEQ released their prioritization list establishing which facilities within the state likely pose the greatest risk to their communities based on emissions inventories that facilities submitted to the ODEQ. The ODEQ established four risk groups. None of our mills were identified in the first tier risk group. Our Medford plywood mill was identified in the second tier group, which initially was expected to be selected into the program in 2021 or 2022; however, to date the ODEQ has not completed the program for first tier risk group and has not updated their timeline for the second tier group. Our other Oregon mills were identified in the third and fourth tier groups and will likely not be selected for several more years. When selected into the program, the facilities may incur expenses to evaluate the risk to the public and may be required to incur additional operating or capital expenditures to mitigate any significant risk.
The Regional Haze Rule, promulgated by the EPA, sets standards for visual air clarity in "Federal Class I" areas such as national parks and wilderness areas. In 2020, the ODEQ required our Medford and Elgin plywood mills to submit a cost/benefit analysis of emission controls that would reduce pollution at the mills associated with regional haze. In January 2021, both facilities received a preliminary determination from the ODEQ that additional controls would “likely” be required for the facilities’ boilers. Our Medford plywood mill negotiated permit emission reductions sufficient to reduce their potential regional haze impact to below the ODEQ threshold, and therefore, will not be required to install additional controls or take other actions. The emission reductions are not expected to impact the facility's ability to meet production goals. Our Elgin plywood mill is required to conduct a study to determine what levels of emission reduction can be achieved by installation of improved boiler controls, begin install of boiler combustion improvements in July 2023, monitor emissions and propose new emission limits by December 2025, and then be fully compliant with those new emission limits by August 2026.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from these estimates. We believe that the accounting estimates discussed below represent the accounting estimates requiring the exercise of judgment where a different set of judgments could result in the greatest changes to reported results. We reviewed the development, selection, and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our board of directors. Our current critical accounting estimates are as follows:
EWP Rebates and Allowances
We provide EWP rebates at various stages of the supply chain (including distributors, dealers, and homebuilders) as a means to increase sales. EWP rebates are based on the volume of purchases (measured in dollars or units), among other factors such as customer loyalty, conversion, and commitment incentives, as well as temporary protection from price increases. EWP rebate estimates are based on the expected amount to be paid and are recorded as a decrease in "Sales" as revenue is recognized. The estimate of EWP rebates is inherently difficult due to the time lag of information and it is challenging to estimate sales subject to rebate as the products transition beyond our wholesale customers and through the supply chain to homebuilders. In addition, some EWP rebate accruals are estimated based on achievement of tiered sales levels, which require management to forecast sales throughout the supply chain, using incentive terms that vary at each level. Information that we consider when estimating sales activity at dealers and homebuilders includes historical sales information, sales projections, publicly available information of housing starts by homebuilder, residential development audits, and economic forecasts of new residential construction, among other economic data. We update these forecasts on a regular basis. We adjust our estimate of revenue at the earlier of the time when the probability of EWP rebates paid changes or the time when the amounts of rebates become fixed. Because of the complexity of some of these rebates, the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimate of EWP rebates payable. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $117.5 million and $40.7 million, respectively, of EWP rebates payable recorded in "Accrued liabilities, Other" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Long-Lived Asset Impairment
We review the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable (triggering event). No triggering event was identified during the year ended December 31, 2021. An impairment of a long-lived asset exists when the carrying value is not recoverable through future undiscounted cash flows from operations and when the carrying value of an asset or asset group exceeds its fair value.
To the extent the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds future undiscounted cash flows, we would be required to estimate the fair value of the asset or asset group, and long-lived asset impairment would become a critical accounting estimate. To measure future cash flows, we are required to make assumptions about future sales volumes, future product pricing, and future expenses to be incurred. Estimates of future cash flows may change based on overall economic conditions, the cost and availability of wood fiber, environmental requirements, capital spending, and other strategic management decisions. We estimate the fair value of an asset or asset group based on quoted market prices for similar assets (the amount for which the asset(s) could be bought or sold in a current transaction with a third party) when available (Level 2 measurement) or the expected proceeds from the sale of the assets (Level 3 measurement). When quoted market prices are not available, we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value (Level 3 measurement).
Future events or circumstances such as sustained negative economic impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, declines in single-family housing starts, environmental regulations or restrictions, sustained periods of weak commodity prices, loss of key customers, capacity additions by competitors, changes in the competitive position of our products, or changes in raw materials or manufacturing costs that lead us to believe the long-lived asset will no longer provide a sufficient return on investment, could prompt decisions to invest capital differently than expected, sell facilities, or to curtail operations. Any of these factors, among others, could result in non-cash impairment or accelerated depreciation charges in the future with respect to long-lived assets, which could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period in which an impairment is recognized. Due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of assets and the effects of changes on these valuations, the timing, precision, and reliability of our estimates are subject to uncertainty. As additional information becomes known, we may change our estimates.
