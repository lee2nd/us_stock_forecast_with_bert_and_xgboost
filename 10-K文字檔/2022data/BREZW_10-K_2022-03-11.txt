ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Amendment including, without limitation, statements under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” regarding the Company’s financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. When used in this Amendment, words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend” and similar expressions, as they relate to us or the Company’s management, identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, the Company’s management. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Amendment. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
Overview
We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 11, 2020 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses. We intend to effectuate our business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.
As indicated in the accompanying financial statements, at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had $5,403 and $693,818 in cash, respectively, and a working capital deficit of $1,667,202 and surplus of $626,554, respectively (excluding franchise tax payable and common stock payable). We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete our initial business combination will be successful.
Results of Operations
We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from June 11, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2021 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below, and, after our Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for a business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the trust account, and changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had net income of $8,703,976 which consisted of a change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $10,378,500, interest income in our money market account of $764, and an unrealized gain on marketable securities held in our trust account of $47,076, offset by operating and formation costs of $1,722,364.
For the period from June 11, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020, we had a net loss of $2,537,690 which consisted of operating and formation costs of $344,223, expensed offering costs of $395,625, and a change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $1,807,500, offset by interest income in our money market account of $178, and an unrealized gain on marketable securities held in our trust account of $9,480.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
On November 25, 2020, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 11,500,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit (including 1,500,000 units from the full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option), generating gross proceeds of $115,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 5,425,000 private placement warrants to the Sponsor at a price of $1.00 per warrant, generating gross proceeds of $5,425,000.
Following the Initial Public Offering, the exercise of the over-allotment option and the sale of the private placement warrants, a total of $116,725,000 was placed in the trust account. We incurred $4,099,907 in transaction costs, including $2,300,000 of underwriting fees, $1,322,350 of representative share offering costs, and $477,557 of other offering costs.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and marketable securities held in the trust account of $117,931,556 (including $56,556 of unrealized gains) consisting of U.S. Treasury Bills with a maturity of 180 days or less. Interest income on the balance in the trust account may be used by us to pay taxes. Through December 31, 2021, we did not withdraw any interest earned on the trust account.
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and marketable securities held in the trust account of $116,734,480 (including $9,480 of unrealized gains) consisting of U.S. Treasury Bills with a maturity of 180 days or less. Interest income on the balance in the trust account may be used by us to pay taxes.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, cash used in operating activities was $688,415 which was due to a change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $10,378,500, and an unrealized gain on marketable securities held in Trust Account of $47,076, offset in part by our net income of $8,703,976, compensation expense for common stock purchased by Directors from Sponsor of $401,000, and changes in working capital of $632,185.
For the period from June 11, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020, cash used in operating activities was $253,625, which was due to our net loss of $2,537,690, and unrealized gains on marketable securities held in Trust Account of $9,480, offset in part by a change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $1,807,500, and expensed offering costs added back to net loss of $395,625, and changes in working capital of $90,420.
We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account (less deferred underwriting commissions and income taxes payable), to complete our business combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had $5,403 and $693,818, respectively, in cash held outside of the Trust Account and a working capital deficit of $1,667,202 and surplus of $626,554, respectively, (excluding franchise tax payable and common stock payable).
In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, the initial stockholders or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,000,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants identical to the private placement warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.
On November 19, 2021, the Sponsor loaned the Company an aggregate of $1,150,000 pursuant to an unsecured promissory note to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from November 25, 2021 to February 25, 2022. This unsecured promissory note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) the consummation of an initial Business Combination, or (ii) August 31, 2022.
On February 18, 2022, the Sponsor loaned the Company an aggregate of $1,150,000 pursuant to an unsecured promissory note to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from February 25, 2022 to May 25, 2022. This unsecured promissory note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) the consummation of an initial Business Combination, or (ii) August 31, 2022.
We believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. If our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon consummation of our business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. If we are unable to complete our business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In addition, following our business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations.
Off-balance sheet financing arrangements
We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Contractual obligations
On November 19, 2021, the Sponsor loaned the Company an aggregate of $1,150,000 pursuant to an unsecured promissory note to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from November 25, 2021 to February 25, 2022. This unsecured promissory note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) the consummation of an initial Business Combination, or (ii) August 31, 2022.
On February 18, 2022, the Sponsor loaned the Company an aggregate of $1,150,000 pursuant to an unsecured promissory note to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from February 25, 2022 to May 25, 2022. This unsecured promissory note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) the consummation of an initial Business Combination, or (ii) August 31, 2022.
We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay Breeze Financial, Inc. a monthly fee of $5,000 for office space, administrative and support services to the Company, and monthly D&O insurance premium payments of $11,697 ending February 28, 2022. We began incurring these fees on November 23, 2020 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the business combination and the Company’s liquidation.
The underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of $0.275 per share, or $3,162,500 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the trust account solely in the event that we complete a business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies:
Warrant Liabilities
We account for the warrants issued in connection with our initial public offering in accordance with ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (“ASC 815”), under which the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity classification and must be recorded as liabilities. As the warrants meet the definition of a derivative as contemplated in ASC 815, the Warrants are measured at fair value at inception and at each reporting date in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, with changes in fair value recognized in the Statement of Operations in the period of change.
Representative and Consultant Shares
Pursuant to the underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) between the Company and I-Bankers Securities (the “Representative”), on November 23, 2020, the Company issued to the Representative and its designee 250,000 shares of common stock and separately agreed to issue the Company’s Consultant 15,000 shares of common stock for nominal consideration in a private placement intended to be exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Act. The Company accounts for the Representative Shares and Consultant Shares as a deferred offering cost of the Initial Public Offering. Accordingly, the offering cost will be allocated to the separable financial instruments issued in the Initial Public Offering based on a relative fair value basis, compared to total proceeds received. Offering costs allocated to the Warrants will be expensed immediately in the Statement of Operations, while offering costs allocated to the redeemable Public Shares will be deferred and subsequently charged to temporary stockholders’ equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering.
Common stock subject to possible redemption
We account for common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. Our common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ deficit section of our balance sheet.
Net Income (Loss) Per Share
Net income (loss) per share of common stock is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. As the Public Shares are considered to be redeemable at fair value, and a redemption at fair value does not amount to a distribution different than other stockholders, redeemable and non-redeemable shares of common stock are presented as one class of shares in calculating net income (loss) per share of common stock. As a result, the calculated net income (loss) per share is the same for redeemable and non-redeemable shares of common stock.
Emerging Growth Company
Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard.
This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company, which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period, difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
Recent Accounting Standards
In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (“ASU 2020-06”) to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity’s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity’s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective January 1, 2022 and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted beginning on January 1, 2021. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that ASU 2020-06 would have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
