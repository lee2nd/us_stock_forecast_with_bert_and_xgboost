ITEM 7. - MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Forward-Looking Statements
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with Item 1, “Business,” and the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
This discussion contains forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under Item 1, “Business-Forward-Looking Statements” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and elsewhere in this report. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
We use contribution margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow herein as non-GAAP measures of our financial performance. For further discussion of contribution margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, see the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We define various terms to simplify the presentation of information in this Report. All share amounts are presented in thousands.
Factors Impacting Comparability of Our Financial Results
Our historical results of operations and cash flows are not indicative of results of operations and cash flows to be expected in the future, principally for the following reasons:
•Litigation settlement. We entered into a Settlement Agreement with U.S. Well Services pursuant to which U.S. Well Services paid us a $35.0 million cash payment to settle $54.6 million of outstanding accounts receivable. The difference between the cash received and the outstanding accounts receivable balance was recorded as bad debt expense in the amount of $19.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.
•Impairment loss. In 2021, we recorded an inventory impairment loss of $2.2 million related to the write down of inventory driven by expected yield. In 2020, we recorded an impairment loss of $5.1 million to fully write down the value of our long-lived assets in the Permian basin as we have no intentions to develop these properties in the foreseeable future. In 2019, we recorded impairment losses of $15.5 million, of which $7.6 million related to our finite-lived developed technology intangible assets and $7.9 million relates to our Hixton, Wisconsin property. These amounts were recorded as an operating expense on the consolidated statements of operations. See our discussion in the section entitled “GAAP Results of Operations” for additional information regarding these transactions.
•Market Trends. In recent years, the increasing supply of sand, particularly in-basin sand, relative to demand, has led to a continued depression of frac sand prices. Demand was strong in the first half of 2019 before declining toward the end of 2019 as oil and gas companies exhausted their budgets and managed their capital spending to be in line with their expected operating cash flows. During most of 2020, demand for frac sand declined significantly due to decreased demand for oil and natural gas as a result of the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a global decrease in all means of travel, the closure of borders between countries and a general slowing of economic activity worldwide. Activity in the oil and gas industry began to rebound in the fourth quarter of 2020 and through the year ended 2021 as the global distribution of COVID-19 vaccines ramped up and travel restrictions lessened. We have seen an increase in the volume of sand sold since the global economy began reopening, however the prices of frac sand have continued to be depressed due to overbuilt capacity. Increased supply of sand coupled with volatility in oil demand has resulted in lower prices for our products and has led to reduced interest in long-term contracts as customers have instead trended toward purchasing their frac sand supply in the spot market at current market prices. However, we expect that the recent higher demand for frac sand could lead to better pricing opportunities, although we cannot predict when frac sand prices will increase or stabilize, if at all.

Overview
We are a fully integrated frac sand supply and services company, offering complete mine to wellsite proppant supply and logistics solutions to our customers. We produce low-cost, high quality Northern White frac sand, which is a premium proppant used to enhance hydrocarbon recovery rates in the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells. We also offer proppant logistics solutions to our customers through our in-basin transloading terminals and our SmartSystemsTM wellsite proppant storage capabilities. We market our products and services to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, oilfield service companies and industrial manufacturers, and sell our sand under a combination of long-term take-or-pay contracts and spot sales in the open market, and provide wellsite proppant storage solutions services and equipment under flexible contract terms custom tailored to meet customers’ needs. We believe that, among other things, the size and favorable geologic characteristics of our sand reserves, the strategic location and logistical advantages of our facilities, our proprietary SmartDepotTM portable wellsite proppant storage silos, SmartPathTM transloader and the industry experience of our senior management team make us as a highly attractive provider of frac sand and proppant logistics services from the mine to the wellsite.
We own and operate a frac sand mine and related processing facility near Oakdale, Wisconsin, at which we have approximately 250 million tons of proven and probable recoverable sand reserves as of December 31, 2021. We incorporated in Delaware in July 2011 and began operations with 1.1 million tons of annual nameplate processing capacity in July 2012. After several expansions, our current annual processing capacity at our Oakdale facility is approximately 5.5 million tons of frac sand. Our integrated Oakdale facility, with on-site rail infrastructure and wet and dry sand processing facilities, has access to two Class I rail lines and enables us to process and cost-effectively deliver products to our customers.
In September 2020, we acquired from Eagle all of the issued and outstanding interests in Eagle Proppants Holdings. The primary assets of Eagle Proppants Holdings and its subsidiaries include two frac sand mines and related processing facilities in Utica, Illinois and New Auburn, Wisconsin. The Utica mine has approximately 129 million tons of proven and probable reserves and 1.6 million tons of annual processing capacity with access to the BNSF Class I rail line through the Peru, Illinois transload facility. We began operating the Utica, Illinois mine and Peru, Illinois transload facility in October 2020. We currently have no intention of operating the New Auburn, Wisconsin mine for the foreseeable future. The acquisition also included rights to use a rail terminal located in El Reno, Oklahoma, which was idled at the time of the acquisition but has recently started operating again.
We operate a unit train capable transloading terminal in Van Hook, North Dakota to service the Bakken Formation in the Williston Basin. We operate this terminal under a long-term agreement with Canadian Pacific Railway to service the Van Hook terminal directly along with the other key oil and natural gas exploration and production basins of North America. The Van Hook terminal became operational in April 2018. Since operations commenced, we have been providing Northern White sand in-basin at this terminal to our contracted and spot sales customers. This terminal allows us to offer more efficient delivery options to customers operating in the Bakken Formation in the Williston Basin.
In September 2021, we acquired the rights to construct and operate another transloading terminal in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania to service the Appalachian Basin, including the Marcellus and Utica Formations. The Waynesburg terminal became operational in January 2022. We believe the Waynesburg terminal will allow us to be one of the most efficient and low-cost sources of frac sand in the Appalachian Basin.
We also offer to our customers portable wellsite proppant storage and management solutions through our SmartSystems products and services. Our SmartSystems provide our customers with the capability to unload, store and deliver proppant at the wellsite, as well as the ability to rapidly set up, takedown and transport the entire system. This capability creates flexibility in how the units are utilized at the wellsite, enhanced safety and reliability for customers and efficiencies in the delivery of frac sand to the wellsite which allows customers to reduce trucking requirements and diesel fuel consumption of their field operations.

Recent Developments
Waynesburg Transload Terminal
In September 2021, we acquired the rights to construct and operate a transloading terminal in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania to service the Appalachian Basin, including the Marcellus and Utica Formations. The Waynesburg terminal became operational in January 2022. We believe our Waynesburg terminal will allow us to be one of the most efficient and low-cost sources of frac sand in the Appalachian Basin.
Blair Mine and Processing Facility
On March 4, 2022, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with HCR and Blair, pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of Blair from HCR for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $6.5 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. Entities affiliated with Clearlake Capital (“Clearlake”), who collectively own approximately 24% of the Company’s outstanding common stock, also own a significant portion of the outstanding common stock of Hi-Crush, and representatives of Clearlake serve on our board of directors and HCR’s board of directors.
The primary assets of Blair consist of an idle frac sand mine and related processing facility located in Blair, Wisconsin. The Blair facility has approximately 2.8 million tons of total annual processing capacity and contains an onsite, unit train capable rail terminal with access to the Class 1 Canadian National Railway.
We believe this acquisition broadens our mine to wellsite capabilities by adding high quality sand mining and processing assets coupled with enhanced logistics options that provide direct access to an additional Class I rail line. We believe these additional mining and logistics resources help secure our ability to be the preferred provider of Northern White Sand in the proppants market. With this acquisition, we now have direct access to four Class I rail lines and the ability to access all Class 1 rail lines within the United States and Canada.
Assets and Operations
Oakdale, Wisconsin
Our sand reserves in Oakdale include a balanced concentration of coarse sand, (19% 20/40 and coarser), finer sand (41% of 40/70 mesh) and fine sand (40% 60/140 gradation, which we refer to in this annual report as “100 mesh”). Our 30/50 gradation is a derivative of the 20/40 and 40/70 blends. We believe that this mix of coarse and fine sand reserves, combined with contractual demand for our products across a range of mesh sizes, provides us with relatively higher mining yields and lower processing costs than frac sand mines with predominantly coarse sand reserves. We have approximately 250 million tons of proven and probable recoverable reserves, which brings our estimated life of mine to approximately 90 years, based on current volumes. This long reserve life enables us to better serve demand for different types of frac sand as compared to mines with shorter reserve lives.
Our Oakdale facility is purpose-built to exploit the reserve profile in place and produce high-quality frac sand. Unlike some of our competitors, our primary processing and rail loading facilities are located in close proximity to the mine site, which limits the need for us to truck sand on public roads between the mine and the production facility or between wet and dry processing facilities. Our on-site transportation assets include approximately nine miles of rail track in a triple-loop configuration and four railcar loading facilities that are connected to a Class I rail line owned by Canadian Pacific. This enables us to simultaneously accommodate multiple unit trains and significantly increases our efficiency in meeting our customers’ frac sand transportation needs. Our unit train capable transload facility approximately three miles from the Oakdale facility in Byron Township, Wisconsin, provides us with the ability to ship sand to our customers on the Union Pacific rail network. We believe that we are the only sand facility in Wisconsin that has dual served rail capabilities, which should create competition among our rail carriers and allow us to provide more competitive logistics options for our customers.
Utica & Peru, Illinois
Our Utica facility also has a large high-quality reserve base of primarily fine-mesh sand that is contiguous to the production facility and in close proximity to our Peru transload facility located on the BNSF railway. We have approximately
SMART SAND, INC.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(UNAUDITED)
129 million tons of proven and probable reserves, which gives us an estimated life of mine of approximately 161 years, based on current volumes. Our Utica facility provides us with significant logistics assets that further increases our logistics advantage, including access to BNSF, a Class I rail line, through our owned Peru transload facility. Additionally, the CSX and NS rail lines are available within short trucking distances. This facility is also capable of handling multiple unit trains simultaneously. These additional logistics options give us greater access to operating basins in the Western United States allowing us to offer more competitive pricing to existing and new customers in these markets.
Logistics
Through our transloading terminal in Van Hook, North Dakota, we provide one of the most efficient and lowest-cost sources of Northern White sand in-basin to customers operating in the Bakken Formation in the Williston Basin. With the addition of our Waynesburg terminal in the Appalachian Basin in 2021, we are now able to also provide one of the most efficient and lowest-cost sources of Northern White sand in-basin to customers operating in the Marcellus and Utica Formations. We also acquired a rail terminal from the Eagle acquisition located in El Reno, Oklahoma, which allows us to economically provide frac sand to customers operating nearby, including customers using our SmartSystems last mile equipment.
Through our SmartSystems offering, we have the technology, production capacity and management team to compete further in the frac sand supply chain for our customers by offering logistics services from the mine all the way to the wellsite. Our SmartSystems consist of our SmartDepot proppant storage silos, our SmartPath transloader and our rapid deployment trailer system.
We believe our patented SmartDepot silos will outperform our competitors in that they can be set up or taken down rapidly, they include industry-leading passive and active dust suppression technology, they have the capability of gravity-fed operation and they can be filled by both pneumatic and gravity dump trailers. Our trailers detach, which reduces their footprint on the wellsite. In 2020, we developed a self-contained SmartPath transloader, which is a mobile sand transloading system designed to work with bottom dump trailers and features a drive over conveyor, surge bin, and dust collection system, and we believe the system has the ability to keep up with any hydraulic fracturing operation. Our rapid deployment trailers are designed for quick setup, takedown and transportation of the entire SmartSystem, and they detach from the wellsite equipment, which allows for removal from the wellsite during operation. We have also developed a proprietary software program, the SmartSystem TrackerTM, which allows our SmartSystems customers to monitor silo-specific information, including location, proppant type and proppant inventory.
Through the expansion of our SmartSystems fleet and other logistics options, we continue evaluating ways to reduce the landed cost of our products in-basin and to the wellsite for our customers while increasing our customized service offerings to provide additional delivery and pricing alternatives, including selling product on an “as-delivered” basis to the wellsite. We believe that our SmartSystems reduce trucking and related fuel consumption for our customers, helping them meet their goals to reduce their carbon footprint in their daily operations.
In 2020, we significantly expanded our existing logistics infrastructure through the acquisition of Eagle Proppants Holdings by adding new origination and destination points to our existing capabilities. We expect to continue to capitalize on our Oakdale facility’s ability to simultaneously accommodate multiple unit trains on-site with the Canadian Pacific rail network and ship on two Class I rail carriers to maximize our product shipment rates, increase our railcar utilization and lower our transportation costs. Through our transloading facility located on the Union Pacific rail network approximately three miles from our Oakdale facility, we have the ability to ship our frac sand directly to our customers on a second Class I rail carrier. Our newly acquired Peru transload terminal, located just minutes away from our Utica mine and frac sand processing facility, offers additional capability to ship products on a third Class I rail carrier, the BNSF.
How We Generate Revenue
We generate revenue by excavating and processing frac sand, which we sell to our customers under long-term price agreements or as spot sales at prevailing market rates. In some instances, revenues also include a charge for transportation services provided to customers. Our transportation revenue fluctuates based on a number of factors, including the volume of product transported and the distance between the plant and our customers. Our long-term price agreements typically contain a minimum volume purchase requirement and provide for delivery of frac sand from one of our processing facilities, transloading terminals or another location specified by our customers. Revenue is generally recognized as products are delivered in accordance with the contract.
SMART SAND, INC.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(UNAUDITED)
We generate revenue on our SmartSystems by renting equipment to our customers under contract terms tailored to meet the short-term or long-term needs with any number of SmartDepots, SmartPaths or trailers they require. We recognize rental revenue when the equipment is made available for the customer to use or other obligations in the contract are met.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we expanded our product line to begin offering sand through IPS. Though sales of IPS were immaterial in 2021, we expect to expand and diversify to serve the major industrial markets throughout North America, including glass, foundry, building products, filtration, geothermal, renewables, ceramics, turf & landscape, retail, recreation and more in 2022.
Costs of Conducting Our Business
The principal direct costs involved in operating our business are freight charges, which consist of transportation, railcar rental and storage, and production costs, which consists of labor, maintenance, utilities, equipment, excavation and depreciation of our property, plant and equipment. We incur labor costs associated with employees at our processing facilities which represent the most significant cost of converting sand to finished products. Our sand processing and logistics facilities undergo maintenance to minimize unscheduled downtime and ensure the ongoing quality of our sand and ability to meet customer demands. We incur utility costs in connection with the operation of our processing and logistics facilities, primarily electricity and natural gas, which are both susceptible to market fluctuations. We lease equipment in many areas of our operations including our mining and hauling equipment and logistics services. Excavation costs relate to the blasting and excavation of sand and other materials in order to retrieve desirable sand products. In addition, other costs including processing costs, overhead allocation, depreciation and depletion are capitalized as a component of inventory and are reflected in cost of goods sold when inventory is sold.
Overall Trends and Outlook
Demand Trends
According to Spears, the North American proppant market, including frac sand, ceramic and resin-coated proppant, was approximately 73 million tons in 2021, which is approximately 26% increase from the 58 million tons Spears reported for 2020. Spears estimates that 2022 demand will increase to 90 million tons, which is approximately 23% increase over 2021.
Supply Trends
There has been consolidation activity including mergers, acquisitions, closures of mines and bankruptcy filings among our peers. Additional consolidation activity could occur in 2022 in the mining, transloading and logistics businesses. Many large oil and natural gas exploration and production companies have continued to integrate vertically by sourcing their own proppant and some own their own sand mines.
Supplies of high-quality Northern White frac sand are limited to select areas, predominantly in western Wisconsin and limited areas of Minnesota and Illinois. We believe the ability to obtain large contiguous reserves in these areas is a key constraint and can be an important supply consideration when assessing the economic viability of a potential frac sand facility. Further constraining the supply and throughput of Northern White frac sand is that not all of the large reserve mines have on-site excavation, processing or logistics capabilities. Historically, much of the capital investment in Northern White frac sand mines was used for the development of coarser deposits in western Wisconsin, which is inconsistent with the increasing demand for finer mesh frac sand in recent years. As such, we’ve seen competitors in the Northern White frac sand market reduce their capacity by shuttering or idling operations as the shift to finer sands in hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells erodes the ongoing economic viability of producing coarser grades of sand.

Management’s Outlook
In 2021, we started several strategic initiatives to take advantage of the current market downturn and set ourselves up for success in 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2021 we expanded our product line to begin offering IPS. Though sales to IPS customers were immaterial in 2021, we expect to expand and diversify our customer base to serve the major industrial markets throughout North America, including glass, foundry, building products, filtration, geothermal, renewables, ceramics, turf & landscape, retail and recreation beginning in 2022. In 2021, we also acquired the rights to construct and operate a transloading terminal in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania to service the Appalachian Basin, including the Marcellus and Utica Formations. The Waynesburg terminal became operational in January 2022. We believe Waynesburg terminal will allow us to be one of the most efficient and low-cost sources of frac sand in the Appalachian Basin. In March 2022, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with HCR to Purchase its Blair facility. The primary assets of Blair consist of a frac sand mine and related processing facility located in Blair, Wisconsin, which has approximately 2.8 million tons of total annual processing capacity and contains an onsite, unit train capable rail terminal with access to the Class 1 Canadian National Railway. With this acquisition, we now have direct access to four Class I rail lines and the ability to access all Class 1 rail lines within the United States and Canada.
We expect the demand to improve for frac sand in 2022. We believe higher demand driven by increased drilling and completion activity should also lead to the opportunity for price improvement for frac sand over the course of 2022. Demand for both frac sand and our SmartSystems is influenced by the volume of oil and natural gas well drilling and completion activity, as well as the types of wells that are completed. We expect the Bakken and Marcellus formations to continue to be key markets for us and we look to expand our market share in these key areas through our current strategic initiatives.
The industry trends continue towards drilling and completing wells with longer laterals and more frac stages per lateral foot drilled. This trend is leading to higher volumes of sand per well and the need for oil and natural gas exploration companies to manage larger volumes of sand at the wellsite. We believe these trends support continued demand for frac sand and increased demand for SmartSystems as customers look to create synergies in the time and cost of managing their sand needs at the wellsite.
We generally expect the price of frac sand to fluctuate based on the level of drilling and completions activity for oil and natural gas as well as overall supply for frac sand relative to demand. In recent years, an increasing supply of sand has kept prices depressed. We believe the supply of sand to be stabilizing or contracting as consolidation in the industry continues. The willingness of exploration and production companies to engage in new drilling is determined by a number of factors, the most important of which are the prevailing and projected prices of oil and natural gas, the cost to drill, complete and operate a well, the availability and cost of capital and environmental and government regulations, as well as their ability to source sand delivered to the wellsite. We generally expect the level of drilling to correlate with long-term trends in commodity prices. Similarly, oil and natural gas production levels nationally and regionally generally tend to correlate with drilling activity.

GAAP Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2021 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020:
Revenue
Revenue was $126.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, during which we sold approximately 3,189,000 tons of sand. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $122.3 million, during which we sold approximately 1,886,000 tons of sand. The key factors contributing to the increase in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 were as follows:
•Sand sales revenue increased from $70.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $117.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as a result of higher total volumes sold. The volumes sold in 2020 were negatively impacted by depressed oil prices driven by continued oversupply relative to the decreased demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sand volumes increased by 69% from 2020 to 2021, however, due to lower average sand prices, total revenue did not increase at the same rate.
•We had $4.4 million of contractual shortfall revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively. We recognize revenue to the extent of the unfulfilled minimum
SMART SAND, INC.

(UNAUDITED)
contracted quantity at the shortfall price per ton as stated in the contract. Shortfall revenue of $14.0 million in 2020 was from a customer with which we settled litigation.
•Logistics revenue, which includes freight for certain mine gate sand sales, railcar usage, logistics services and SmartSystems rentals, was $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $23.3 million when compared to logistics revenue of $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in logistics revenue was due to the shift from mine gate sales to in-basin sales, which include transportation and any other handling services.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold was $140.4 million and $104.2 million, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes sold and increased freight cost due to the shift of sales to more in-basin deliveries in 2021. During 2020, headcount reductions and other cost savings measures were implemented as a result of the onset of COVID-19. Headcount and production costs increased in 2021 to support increased sales activity, though we remain focused on other cost-saving measures.
Gross Profit
Gross profit was $(15.9) million and $18.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The decline in gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to decreased shortfall revenue and low average sales price of our sand relative to the cost to produce and deliver products to our customers. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2021 included $2.2 million related to a write-down of inventory based on expected yield.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses were $47.6 million and $31.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. In 2021, we recorded $19.6 million as non-cash bad debt expense, which is the difference between the $54.6 million accounts receivable balance that was subject to litigation and the $35.0 million cash payment received under the Settlement Agreement. Salaries, benefits and payroll taxes increased to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, as we increased headcount to support higher levels of production activity and restored the variable compensation in 2021. Depreciation and amortization was largely consistent in 2021 as compared to 2020. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of decreased professional fees in 2021 as we settled our ongoing litigation with U.S. Well Services. December 31, 2020 included an impairment charge of $5.1 million related to the full impairment of long-lived assets in the Permian basin as we have no intentions to develop these properties in the foreseeable future.
Other Income
We qualified for federal government assistance through employee retention credit provisions of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded $5.0 million of employee retention credits. The calculation of the credit is based on employees continued employment and represents a portion of the wages paid to them. For income tax purposes, the credit will result in decreased expense related to the wages it offsets in the period received. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a gain on bargain purchase of $39.6 million related to our acquisition of Eagle Proppants Holdings. The gain was a result of the total fair value of net assets acquired in the transaction of $41.7 million, which exceeded the total consideration of $2.1 million paid to Eagle for such assets.
Interest Expense
We incurred $2.0 million and $2.1 million of net interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We continue to reduce debt levels and decrease interest expense through scheduled amortizing payments.
Income Tax (Benefit) Expense
Income tax benefit was $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to income tax expense of $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our effective tax rate was approximately 15.1% and (52.0)%, respectively, based on the annual effective tax rate net of discrete federal and state taxes.
SMART SAND, INC.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(UNAUDITED)
The computation of the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 included modifications from the statutory rate such as income tax credits, depletion deductions, carrybacks as a result of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, and state apportionment changes, among other items. The bargain purchase gain related to our acquisition of Eagle Proppants Holdings that we recorded during the third quarter of 2020 is not taxable.
Net (Loss) Income
Net loss was $(50.7) million for year ended December 31, 2021 compared to net income of $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The net loss in 2021 was primarily due to reduced gross profit on our sand sales and non-cash bad debt expense of $19.6 million related to our settlement with U.S. Well Services. Net income in 2020 was primarily due to shortfall revenue and the gain on bargain purchase related to our acquisition of Eagle Proppants Holdings.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019:
Revenue
Revenue was $122.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, during which we sold approximately 1,886,000 tons of sand. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $233.1 million, during which we sold approximately 2,462,000 tons of sand. The key factors contributing to the decrease in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 were as follows.
SMART SAND, INC.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
(UNAUDITED)
•Sand sales revenue decreased from $109.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $70.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of lower total volumes sold. The volumes sold in 2020 were negatively impacted by depressed oil prices driven by continued oversupply relative to the decreased demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
•We had $23.3 million of contractual shortfall revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $49.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively. We recognize revenue to the extent of the unfulfilled minimum contracted quantity at the shortfall price per ton as stated in the contract.
•Logistics revenue, which includes freight for certain mine gate sand sales, railcar usage, logistics services and SmartSystems rentals, was $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $46 million when compared to logistics revenue of $74.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in logistics revenue was due primarily to lower in basin sales due to the drop in demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold was $104.2 million and $152.0 million, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Cost of goods sold decreased primarily due to expense reduction efforts put in place and due to lower production costs and freight expense from lower sales volumes due to lower demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Gross Profit
Gross profit was $18.1 million and $81.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to lower total sales volumes and reduced shortfall revenue.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses were $31.1 million and $37.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Salaries, benefits and payroll taxes were reduced to $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, as we reduced headcount and suspended certain variable cash compensation programs for all employees. Depreciation and amortization decreased from $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of reduced amortization of certain intangible assets that were previously impaired in 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased from $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of increased professional fees related to litigation, acquisition costs related to our purchase of Eagle Proppants Holdings in the amount of $0.9 million and settlement of a multi-year sales tax audit in the amount of $1.3 million.
Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 included an impairment charge of $5.1 million related to the full impairment of long-lived assets in the Permian basin as we have no intentions to develop these properties in the foreseeable future. Operating expenses for year ended December 31, 2019 include an impairment charge of $7.6 million related to the Quickload system that we acquired in connection with our acquisition of Quickthree in 2018 and $7.9 million related to our Hixton, Wisconsin property in property, plant and equipment, net on the balance sheet. We had no plans to actively market the Quickload system, which resulted in the impairment charge. All developed technology intangible assets related to the Quickload system have been impaired of as of December 31, 2019.
Gain on Bargain Purchase
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a gain on bargain purchase of $39.6 million related to our acquisition of Eagle Proppants Holdings. The gain was a result of the total fair value of net assets acquired in the transaction of $41.7 million, which exceeded the total consideration of $2.1 million paid to Eagle for such assets.
Interest Expense
We incurred $2.1 million and $3.6 million of net interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to reduced interest rates on lower average total debt outstanding.

(UNAUDITED)
In 2019, we also recognized $0.6 million of costs due to the extinguishment of the Former Credit Facility. Our borrowings and total debt were reduced late in 2019 as a result of the payment in full and termination of the Former Credit Facility and our entry into the ABL Credit Facility.
Income Tax (Benefit) Expense
Income tax expense was $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to income tax expense of $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our effective tax rate was approximately (52.0)% and 19.8%, respectively, based on the annual effective tax rate net of discrete federal and state taxes. The computation of the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 included modifications from the statutory rate such as income tax credits, depletion deductions, carrybacks as a result of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, and state apportionment changes, among other items. The bargain purchase gain related to our acquisition of Eagle Proppants Holdings that we recorded during the third quarter of 2020 is not taxable.
Net Income
Net income was $38.0 million for year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net income was primarily due to the gain on bargain purchase related to our acquisition of Eagle Proppants Holdings, current year income tax benefit and the impairment of intangible assets in the prior period, offset by the lower tons sold during 2020 driven largely by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Contribution margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are not financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Gross profit is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to contribution margin, net income is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and net cash provided by operating activities is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to free cash flow. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider contribution margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA or free cash flow in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because contribution margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.
Contribution Margin
We use contribution margin, which we define as total revenues less costs of goods sold excluding depreciation, depletion and accretion of asset retirement obligations, to measure our financial and operating performance. Contribution margin excludes other operating expenses and income, including costs not directly associated with the operations of our business such as accounting, human resources, information technology, legal, sales and other administrative activities.
Gross profit is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to contribution margin. Contribution margin should not be considered an alternative to gross profit presented in accordance with GAAP. Because contribution margin may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of contribution margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility. The following table presents a reconciliation of contribution margin to gross profit.
Contribution margin was $10.5 million, or $3.30 per ton sold, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $39.1 million, or $20.75 per ton sold, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in overall contribution margin and contribution margin per ton sold for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to $18.9 million higher shortfall revenue in the prior period and low average sale price relative to our cost to produce and deliver sand to our customers in the current period.
Contribution margin was $39.1 million, or $20.75 per ton sold, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $106.5 million, or $43.24 per ton sold, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in overall contribution margin and contribution margin per ton sold for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to lower volumes sold during the period and decreased shortfall revenue.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
We define EBITDA as net income, plus: (i) depreciation, depletion and amortization expense; (ii) income tax expense (benefit); (iii) interest expense; and (iv) franchise taxes. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, plus: (i) gain or loss on sale of fixed assets or discontinued operations; (ii) integration and transition costs associated with specified transactions; (iii) equity compensation; (iv) acquisition and development costs; (v) non-recurring cash charges related to restructuring, retention and other similar actions; (vi) earn-out, contingent consideration obligations and other acquisition and development costs; and (vii) non-cash charges and unusual or non-recurring charges. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess:
•the financial performance of our assets without regard to the impact of financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis of our assets;
•the viability of capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities;
•our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures;
•our operating performance as compared to those of other companies in our industry without regard to the impact of financing methods or capital structure; and
•our debt covenant compliance, as Adjusted EBITDA is a key component of critical covenants to the ABL Credit Facility.

We believe that our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Net income is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net income presented in accordance with GAAP. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. The following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income for each of the periods indicated.
(1) Represents the non-cash expenses for stock-based awards issued to our employees and employee stock purchase plan compensation expense.
(2) Employee retention credit is part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and is recorded in other income on the statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021.
(3) Represents costs incurred related to the business combinations and current development project activities. The year ended December 31, 2020 includes $891 of costs related to the acquisition of Eagle Proppants Holdings and $1,410 decrease in the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Quickthree. The year ended December 31, 2019 includes $3,272 decrease in the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Quickthree and $225 of development project activities.
(4) The year ended December 31, 2021 represents a write-down of our inventory based on expected yield. December 31, 2020 represents a $5,115 full impairment of long-lived assets in the Permian basin. The year ended December 31, 2019 includes an impairment charge of $7,628 related to the Quickload system and $7,914 related to our Hixton Wisconsin property.

Adjusted EBITDA was $(30.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to $18.9 million less shortfall revenue in the current period, non-cash bad debt expense of $19.6 million related to our settlement with U.S. Well Services, and low average sale prices of our sand relative to the cost to produce and deliver it despite having higher overall volumes in the current period.
Adjusted EBITDA was $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $87.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to lower total volumes sold and decreased shortfall revenue in 2020 than in 2019.

Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment, is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to measure the liquidity of our business.
Net cash provided by operating activities is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to free cash flows. Free cash flows should not be considered an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities presented in accordance with GAAP. Because free cash flows may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of free cash flows may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility. The following table presents a reconciliation of free cash flows to net cash provided by operating activities.
Free cash flow was $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in free cash flow was primarily attributable to a slightly longer cash collection cycle on strong fourth quarter 2021 sales volumes and lower average sales prices of our sand, partially offset by $35.0 million cash payment received under the Settlement Agreement in 2021 as compared to 2020. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $11.2 million compared to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Free cash flow was $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in free cash flow was attributable to lower total volumes sold as a result of the decreased demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This decrease was offset by our reduction in our 2020 capital expenditure budget to align with slowdown of well completion activities by the exploration and production companies and oilfield service companies during 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow generated from operations and availability under our ABL Credit Facility and other equipment financing sources. As of December 31, 2021, cash on hand was $25.6 million and we had $14.9 million in undrawn availability on our ABL Credit Facility.
Based on our balance sheet, cash flows, current market conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and information available to us at this time, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and other available capital resources, to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months, including continued investment in our SmartSystems wellsite proppant storage solutions and other capital projects.
Material Cash Requirements
Capital Requirements
We expect 2022 capital expenditures to be between $25.0 million and $30.0 million, consisting primarily of capital for efficiency projects at Oakdale and Utica, capital related to the Waynesburg terminal and acquisition and incremental capital to purchase the Blair mine and processing facility, acquired on March 4, 2022, and to bring it online over the course of the year. We expect to fund these capital expenditures with existing cash, cash generated from operations, or borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility or other financing sources, such as equipment finance providers.

Indebtedness
We have several debt facilities including the Oakdale Equipment Financing, various notes payable and our ABL Credit Facility. Our Oakdale Equipment Financing is secured by substantially all of the assets at our Oakdale facility. The balance on this facility as of December 31, 2021 was $15.4 million. Minimum cash payments on this facility in 2022 are $4.6 million. Our various notes payable are primarily secured by our manufactured SmartSystems equipment. Total debt under these notes payable as of December 31, 2021 was $6.7 million. Minimum cash payments on these notes payable in 2022 are $3.6 million. There were no borrowings outstanding out our ABL Credit Facility as of December 31, 2021.
Operating Leases
We use leases primarily to procure certain office space, railcars and heavy equipment as part of its operations. The majority of our lease payments are fixed and determinable. Our operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2021 were $32.7 million. Minimum cash payments on operating leases in 2022 are $10.7 million.
Mineral Rights Property
The Company is obligated under certain contracts for minimum payments for the right to use land for extractive activities. The annual minimum payments under these contracts is approximately $2.5 million per year for the next 15 years.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We had $8.6 million and $10.0 million of outstanding performance bonds as of each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These performance bonds assure our performance under our reclamation plan, maintenance and restoration of public roadways.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, hazardous materials, air and water emissions, environmental contamination and reclamation and the protection of the environment and natural resources. We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures.
Seasonality
Our business is affected to some extent by seasonal fluctuations in weather that impact the production levels for a portion of our wet sand processing capacity. While our dry plants are able to process finished product volumes evenly throughout the year, our excavation and our wet sand processing activities have historically been limited to primarily non-winter months. As a consequence, we have experienced lower cash operating costs in the first and fourth quarter of each calendar year, and higher cash operating costs in the second and third quarter of each calendar year when we overproduced to meet demand in the winter months. These higher cash operating costs were capitalized into inventory and expensed when these tons are sold, which can lead to us having higher overall cost of production in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year as we expense inventory costs that were previously capitalized. We have indoor wet processing facilities at each of our plant locations which allow us to produce wet sand inventory year-round to support a portion of our dry sand processing capacity, which may reduce certain of the effects of this seasonality. We may also sell frac sand for use in oil and natural gas producing basins where severe weather conditions may curtail drilling activities and, as a result, our sales volumes to those areas may be reduced during such severe weather periods.
Customer Concentration
For the year ended December 31, 2021, Rice Energy (a subsidiary of EQT Corporation), Halliburton, and Liberty accounted for 24.3%, 18.3%, and 14.8%, respectively, of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Rice Energy (a subsidiary of EQT Corporation), Liberty, and U.S. Well Services accounted for 28.1%, 21.7%, and 14.0%, respectively, of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2019, Liberty, Rice Energy (a subsidiary of EQT Corporation), Hess Corporation, and U.S. Well Services accounted for 23.8%, 19.0%, 15.5%, and 14.7%, respectively, of total revenue.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Our actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
Listed below are the accounting estimates that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved.
Asset Retirement Obligation
We estimate the future cost of dismantling, restoring and reclaiming operating excavation sites and related facilities in accordance with federal, state and local regulatory requirements and recognize reclamation obligations when extraction occurs and record them as liabilities at estimated fair value. In addition, a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related asset is recorded and depreciated over such asset’s useful life or the estimated number of years of extraction. The reclamation liability is accreted to expense over the estimated productive life of the related asset and is subject to adjustments to reflect changes in value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation costs. If the asset retirement obligation is settled for more or less than the carrying amount of the liability, a loss or gain will be recognized, respectively. The asset retirement obligation estimate is calculated by estimating the cost to reclaim an area as of the estimation date and inflating that cost to an estimated reclamation date, then discounting that inflated cost back to the reporting period date. Changes in the current estimate or the interest rates used for inflation or discount can have a material effect on the liability reported. In addition, due to the nature or our business, changes in mine planning can result in changes to our estimated future reclamation dates. At December 31, 2021, we reduced our existing asset retirement obligation, which was offset by a new asset retirement obligation, resulting in a net immaterial change to the balance sheet and no change to the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Inventory Valuation
Sand inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the average cost method. Costs applied to inventory include direct excavation costs, processing costs, overhead allocation, depreciation and depletion. Reserves are estimated for moisture loss and waste during production. Stockpile tonnages are calculated by measuring the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile. Tonnages are verified periodically by a survey. Costs are calculated on a per ton basis and are applied to the stockpiles based on the number of tons in the stockpile. There was no writedown of inventory value based on the lower of cost or net realizable value calculation. However, anticipated waste is considered obsolete inventory. At December 31, 2021, we performed an analysis on our existing inventory and estimated the expected production yield based on waste sand produced in recent months and determined that a portion of our inventory is considered obsolete. We adjusted our inventory down by $2.2 million on December 31, 2021.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We periodically evaluate whether current events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable. If circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, we estimate future undiscounted net cash flows, estimated future sales prices (considering historical and current prices, price trends and related factors) and anticipated operating costs and capital expenditures. If the carrying value of our long-lived assets is less than the undiscounted cash flows, the assets are measured at fair value and an impairment is recorded if that fair value is less than the carrying value.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not record any impairment charges based on the analysis of our long-lived assets. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of $5.1 million related to the full impairment of long-lived assets in the Permian basin as we have no intentions to develop these properties in the foreseeable

future. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded impairment loss of $15.5 million, of which $7.6 million relates to our finite-lived developed technology intangible assets and $7.9 million relates to our Hixton, Wisconsin property. The impairment of the finite-lived intangible assets is from our developed technology allocated to the Quickload acquired in connection with the acquisition of Quickthree in 2018.
Income Taxes
Under the balance sheet approach to provide for income taxes, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible. If we determine it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize the benefits of the deductible temporary differences, we would record a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset.
We recognize the impact of uncertain tax positions at the largest amount that, in our judgment, is more-likely-than-not to be required to be recognized upon examination by a taxing authority.
We have recorded a liability of $2.2 million for uncertain tax positions included in deferred tax liabilities, long-term, net on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021, related to our depletion deduction methodology, and a corresponding increase to the income tax expense on our consolidated statements of operations. There was no liability for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2021, we determined it is more likely than not that we will not be able to fully realize the benefits of certain existing deductible temporary differences and have recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax liabilities, long-term, net on our consolidated balance sheet in the amount of $1.6 million, and a corresponding increase to the income tax expense on our consolidated statements of operations.
