ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following provides a narrative discussion and analysis of The First Bancshares’ financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the supplemental financial data included in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included elsewhere in this report.
Critical Accounting Policies
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Accounting policies considered critical to our financial results include the allowance for credit losses and related provision, income taxes, goodwill and business combinations. The most critical of these is the accounting policy related to the allowance for credit losses. The allowance is based in large measure upon management's evaluation of borrowers' abilities to make loan payments, local and national economic conditions, and other subjective factors. If any of these factors were to deteriorate, management would update its estimates and judgments which may require additional loss provisions.
As a result of the Company's immediate response to COVID-19, including loan modifications/payment deferral programs and the PPP, as well as acquisition and integration of SWG and Cadence Branches, and increased uncertainty related to certain judgments and estimates, the Company has elected to temporarily defer or suspend the application of one provision of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as allowed by the CARES Act, which was signed into law by the President on March 27, 2020. Sections 4013 and 4014 of the CARES Act provide the Company with temporary relief from troubled debt restructurings which the Company believes prudent to elect in these challenging times to allow us time to provide consistent, high-quality financial information to our investors and other stakeholders. Temporary relief was set to expire on the earlier of the first day of the fiscal year that begins after the date on which the national emergency concerning COVID-19 terminates or January 1, 2022. The Company adopted CECL as of January 1, 2021.
COVID-19 IMPACT
In March 2020, the World Health Organization recognized the novel COVID-19 as a pandemic. The spread of COVID-19 has created a global public health crisis that has resulted in unprecedented uncertainty, volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity in the United States and globally. In response to the outbreak, federal and state authorities in the U.S. introduced various measures to try to limit or slow the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions, nonessential business closures, stay-at-home orders, and strict social distancing and shelter in place. These actions, together with responses to the pandemic by businesses and individuals, have resulted in rapid decreases in commercial and consumer activity, temporary closures of many businesses that have led to a loss of revenues and a rapid increase in unemployment, material decreases in oil and gas prices and in business valuations, disrupted global supply chains, market downturns and volatility, changes in consumer behavior related to pandemic fears, related emergency response legislation and an expectation that Federal Reserve policy will maintain a low interest rate environment for the foreseeable future. These disruptions may result in a decline in demand for banking products or services, including loans and deposits, which could impact our future financial condition, result of operations and liquidity. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and the banking industry are rapidly evolving and the future effects are unknown at this time. The Company is working to adapt to the changing environment and proactively plan for contingencies. To that end, the Company has and is taking steps to protect the health of our employees and to work with our customers experiencing difficulties as a result of this virus. The Company has many non-branch personnel working remotely. We have also been working through loan modifications and payment deferral programs to assist affected customers.
The pandemic has had and in some cases is continuing to have an adverse impact on certain industries the Company serves, including hotels, restaurants, retail, and direct energy. As of December 31, 2021, the Company's aggregate outstanding exposure in these segments was $478.9 million, or 16.2% of total loans. While it is not yet possible to know the full effect that the pandemic will have on the economy, or to what extent this crisis will impact the Company, all available current industry statistics and internal monitoring of loan repayment ability and payment forgiveness across the portfolio has been analyzed in an attempt to understand the correlation with asset quality and degree of possible deterioration.
On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. The CARES Act is a $2 trillion stimulus package that is intended to provide relief to U.S businesses and consumers struggling as a result of the pandemic. A provision in the CARES Act includes a $349 billion fund for the creation of the PPP through the Small Business Administration ("SBA") and Treasury Department. The PPP is intended to provide loans to small businesses to pay their employees, rent, mortgage interest, and utilities. The loans may be forgiven conditioned upon the client providing payroll deductions evidencing their compliant use of funds and otherwise complying with the terms of the program. The PPP was amended in April of 2020 to include an additional $320 billion in funding. On June 5, 2020, President Trump signed into law the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act of 2020 ("PPPFA") that amends the CARES Act. The PPPFA extended the covered period in which to use PPP loans, extended the forgiveness period from eight weeks to a maximum of 24 weeks and increased flexibility for small businesses that have had issues with rehiring employees and attempting to fill vacant positions due to COVID-19. The program reduced the proportion of proceeds that must be spent on payroll costs from 75% to 60%. In addition, the PPPFA also extended the payment deferral period for the PPP loans until the date when the amount of loan forgiveness is determined and remitted to the lender.
Section 4013 of the CARES Act, "Temporary Relief from Troubled Debt Restructurings," provides banks the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under U.S. GAAP related to troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") for a limited period of time to account for the effects of COVID-19. To qualify for Section 4013 of the CARES Act, borrowers must have been current at December 31, 2019. All modifications are eligible as long as they are executed between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of (i) December 31, 2020, or (ii) the 60th day after the end of the COVID-19 national emergency declared by the President of the U.S. Loans that were current as of December 31, 2019 are not TDRs. In addition, under guidance from the federal banking agencies, other short-term modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were current prior to any relief are not TDRs under ASC Subtopic 310-40, "Troubled Debt Restructuring by Creditors." These modifications include short-term (e.g., up to six months) modifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or delays in payment that are insignificant. Borrowers considered current are those that are less than 30 days past due on their contractual payments at the time a modification program is implemented. We began receiving requests from our borrowers for loan and lease deferrals in March 2020. Payment modifications include the deferral of principal payments or the deferral of principal and interest payments for terms generally 90-180 days. Requests are evaluated individually and approved modifications are based on the unique circumstances of each borrower. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we have modified approximately 1,643 loans for $710.7 million, of which 1,391 loans for $582.3 million were modified to defer monthly principal and interest payments and 252 loans for $128.4 million were modified from monthly principal and interest payments to interest only. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we have approximately 419 PPP loans approved through the SBA for a balance of $41.1 million.
Effective January 1, 2021, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Measurement of Current Expected Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“CECL”), which modified the accounting for the allowance for loan losses from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model, as discussed more fully under “Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note B - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of this report.
Companies are required to perform periodic reviews of individual securities in their investment portfolios to determine whether decline in the value of a security is other than temporary. A review of other-than-temporary impairment requires companies to make certain judgments regarding the materiality of the decline, its effect on the financial statements and the probability, extent and timing of a valuation recovery and the company’s intent and ability to hold the security. Pursuant to these requirements, management assesses valuation declines to determine the extent to which such changes are attributable to fundamental factors specific to the issuer, such as financial condition, business prospects or other factors or market-related factors, such as interest rates. Declines in the fair value of securities below their cost that are deemed to be other-than-temporary are recorded in earnings as realized losses.
Goodwill is assessed for impairment both annually and when events or circumstances occur that make it more likely than not that impairment has occurred. As part of its testing, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines the fair value of a reporting
unit is less than its carrying amount using these qualitative factors, the Company compares the fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount, and then measures impaired loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Other intangibles are also assessed for impairment, both annually and when events or circumstances occur, that make it more likely than not that impairment has occurred.
During the first quarter of 2020, management determined that the deterioration in the general economic conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic represented a triggering event prompting an evaluation of goodwill impairment. Based on the analyses performed in the first quarter of 2020, we determined that goodwill was not impaired. Due to the ongoing economic uncertainty present at the end of the second quarter, the Company prepared a Step 1 goodwill impairment analysis as of June 30, 2020. In testing goodwill for impairment, the Company compared the estimated fair value of its reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value.
In 2021, the Company elected to perform qualitative assessments, on a quarterly basis, to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded their carrying values. The qualitative assessments indicated that is was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded it carrying value, resulting in no impairment. As a result, we do not believe there exists any impairment to goodwill and intangible assets or long-lived assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, in future periods the Company will be required to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the carrying value of certain of its assets, including goodwill, and to conduct impairments tests on those assets, which may result in impairment charges on these assets in future periods that could be material.
Overview
The First Bancshares, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated on June 23, 1995, and serves as a bank holding company for The First Bank (“The First”), formerly known as The First, A National Banking Association, located in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. The First began operations on August 5, 1996, from its main office in the Oak Grove community, which is now incorporated within the city of Hattiesburg. Currently, the First has 90 locations in Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Louisiana. The Company and The First engage in a general commercial and retail banking business characterized by personalized service and local decision-making, emphasizing the banking needs of small to medium-sized businesses, professional concerns, and individuals.
The Company’s primary source of revenue is interest income and fees, which it earns by lending and investing the funds which are held on deposit. Because loans generally earn higher rates of interest than investments, the Company seeks to employ as much of its deposit funds as possible in the form of loans to individuals, businesses, and other organizations. To ensure sufficient liquidity, the Company also maintains a portion of its deposits in cash, government securities, deposits with other financial institutions, and overnight loans of excess reserves (known as “Federal Funds Sold”) to correspondent banks. The revenue which the Company earns (prior to deducting its overhead expenses) is essentially a function of the amount of the Company’s loans and deposits, as well as the profit margin (“interest spread”) and fee income which can be generated on these amounts.
Highlights for the year ended December 31, 2021 include:
● During the first quarter of 2021, the Company adopted CECL methodology for estimating credit losses, effective January 1, 2021.
● In year-over-year comparison, net income available to common shareholders increased $11.7 million, or 22.2%, from $52.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $64.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
● In year-over-year comparison, net interest income, excluding accretion income and PPP fee income increased $2.7 million, or 1.8%.
● On December 3, 2021, the Company closed its acquisition of seven branches from Cadence Bank which included $40.5 million in loans and $410.2 million in deposits. The Company recorded a bargain purchase gain of $1.3 million related to this acquisition.
● On December 14, 2021, the U.S. Department of Treasury informed the Company of its eligibility to receive $175.0 million of non-dilutive Tier 1 perpetual preferred capital under the Emergency Capital Investment Program (“ECIP”), subject to the Company’s acceptance of the final terms of the ECIP.
● Subsequent to year end, on January 15, 2022, the Bank converted from a national banking association to a Mississippi state-chartered bank and became a member bank of the Federal Reserve System.
At December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $6.077 billion in total assets, an increase of $924.7 million compared to $5.153 billion at December 31, 2020. Loans, including mortgage loans held for sale and net of the allowance for credit losses, decreased to $2.936 billion at December 31, 2021 from $3.109 billion at December 31, 2020. Deposits increased to $5.227 billion at December 31, 2021 from $4.215 billion at December 31, 2020. Stockholders’ equity increased to $676.2 million at December 31, 2021 from $644.8 million at December 31, 2020. The addition of the seven Cadence Bank branches during 2021 contributed, at acquisition, $412.9 million, $40.5 million and $410.2 million in assets, loans, and deposits, respectively.
The First (Bank only) reported net income of $73.9 million, $60.0 million and $51.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company reported consolidated net income available to common stockholders of $64.2 million, $52.5 million and $43.7 million, respectively. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Selected Consolidated Financial Data and the Company's consolidated financial statements and the Notes thereto and the other financial data included elsewhere.

The following reconciles the above table to the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Company at December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 ($ in thousands):
Consolidated Net Income
The Company reported consolidated net income available to common stockholders of $64.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a consolidated net income of $52.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in provision for credit loss expenses in year over year comparison accounted for $19.6 million, net of tax of the change. The Company recorded a bargain purchase gain and loss on sale of land of $674 thousand, net of tax for the year end December 31, 2021 compared to a bargain purchase and sale of land gains of $8.3 million, net of tax for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Net interest income increased $4.4 million in year-over-year comparison, primarily due to interest income earned on a higher volume of securities and a reduction in interest expense due to changes in rates. Non-interest income increased $2.3 million in year-over-year comparison excluding the gains mentioned above. Interchange fee income increased $2.1 million and the U.S. Treasury Rapid Response Program (“RRP”) grant of $1.4 million, net of tax accounted for the increase in year-over-year comparison. Non-interest expense was $114.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $8.2 million as compared to the same period ended December 31, 2020. An increase of $4.6 million in salaries and employee benefits and an increase of $1.7 million in occupancy expense contributed to the increase.
The Company reported consolidated net income available to common stockholders of $52.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a consolidated net income of $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Excluding the bargain purchase and sale of land gains of $8.3 million, net of tax, and the increased provision expense of $16.5 million, net of tax, net income available to common shareholders increased $17.0 million in year-over-year comparison. Net interest income increased $30.9 million in year-over-year comparison, primarily due to interest income earned on a higher volume of loans and securities. Non-interest income increased $6.5 million in year-over-year comparison excluding the awards and gains mentioned above. Mortgage income increased $4.5 million and interchange fee income increased $1.4 million in the year-over-year comparison. Non-interest expense was $106.3 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $17.8 million in year-over-year comparison, of which $12.3 million is related to the operations of First Florida Bank (“FFB”) and SWG.

Consolidated Net Interest Income
The largest component of net income for the Company is net interest income, which is the difference between the income earned on assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowings used to support such assets. Net interest income is determined by the rates earned on the Company’s interest-earning assets and the rates paid on its interest-bearing liabilities, the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the degree of mismatch and the maturity and repricing characteristics of its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.
Consolidated net interest income was approximately $157.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $152.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was the direct result of higher volume of securities and a reduction in interest expense due to changes in rates during 2021 as compared to 2020. Average interest-bearing liabilities for the year 2021 were
$4.548 billion compared to $3.902 billion for the year 2020. At December 31, 2021, the fully tax equivalent (“FTE”) net interest spread, which is the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, was 3.18% compared to 3.59% at December 31, 2020. Net interest margin, which is net interest income divided by average earning assets, was 3.21% for the year 2021 compared to 3.64% for the year 2020. At December 31, 2021, the FTE average yield on all earning assets decreased 66 basis points to 3.61% compared to 4.27% at December 31, 2020. Rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities decreased to 0.43% for the year 2021 compared to 0.68% for the year 2020. Interest earned on assets and interest accrued on liabilities is significantly influenced by market factors, specifically interest rates as set by Federal agencies. Average loans comprised 60.8% of average earnings assets for the year 2021 compared to 71.0% for the year 2020.
Consolidated net interest income was approximately $152.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $121.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was the direct result of higher volume of loans and securities during 2020 as compared to 2019. Average interest-bearing liabilities for the year 2020 were $3.902 billion compared to $2.345 billion for the year 2019. At December 31, 2020, the fully tax equivalent (“FTE”) net interest spread, which is the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, was 3.59% compared to 3.75% at December 31, 2019. Net interest margin, which is net interest income divided by average earning assets, was 3.64% for the year 2020 compared to 4.02% for the year 2019. At December 31, 2020, the FTE average yield on all earning assets decreased 62 basis points to 4.27% compared to 4.89% at December 31, 2019. Rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities decreased to 0.68% for the year 2020 compared to 1.14% for the year 2019. Interest earned on assets and interest accrued on liabilities is significantly influenced by market factors, specifically interest rates as set by Federal agencies. Average loans comprised 71.0% of average earnings assets for the year 2020 compared to 76.5% for the year 2019.
Average Balances, Income and Expenses, and Rates. The following tables depict, for the periods indicated, certain information related to the average balance sheet and average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities. Such yields are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities. Average balances have been derived from daily averages.
Average Balances, Income and Expenses, and Rates
(1) All loans and deposits were made to borrowers or received from depositors in the United States. Includes nonaccrual loans of $28,013, $33,774, and $38,835 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Loans include held for sale loans.
(2) Includes loan fees of $17,138, $9,899, and $4,322 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
(3) Includes Excess Balance Account-Mississippi National Banker’s Bank.
(4) Fully tax equivalent yield assuming a 25.3% tax rate.
Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income. The following table presents the consolidated dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in volume and to changes in rate. The combined effect in both volume and rate which cannot be separately identified has been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and due to rate.
Analysis of Changes in Consolidated Net Interest Income
(1)Fully tax equivalent yield assuming a 25.3% tax rate.
Interest Sensitivity. The Company monitors and manages the pricing and maturity of its assets and liabilities in order to diminish the potential adverse impact that changes in interest rates could have on its net interest income. A monitoring technique employed by the Company is the measurement of the Company’s interest sensitivity "gap," which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time. The Company also performs asset/liability modeling to assess the impact varying interest rates and balance sheet mix assumptions will have on net interest income. Interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing assets or liabilities, selling securities available-for-sale, replacing an asset or liability at maturity, or adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability. Managing the amount of assets and liabilities repricing in the same time interval helps to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net interest income of rising or falling interest rates. The Company evaluates interest sensitivity risk and then formulates guidelines regarding asset generation and repricing, funding sources and pricing, and off-balance sheet commitments in order to decrease interest rate sensitivity risk.
The following tables illustrate the Company’s consolidated interest rate sensitivity and consolidated cumulative gap position by maturity at December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 ($ in thousands):
(1) NOW and savings accounts are subject to immediate withdrawal and repricing. These deposits do not tend to immediately react to changes in interest rates and the Company believes these deposits are fairly stable. Therefore, these deposits are included in the repricing period that management believes most closely matches the periods in which they are likely to reprice rather than the period in which the funds can be withdrawn contractually.
(2) Securities include mortgage backed and other installment paying obligations based upon stated maturity dates.
(3) Does not include subordinated debentures of $144,726, $144,592, $80,678 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
The Company generally would benefit from increasing market rates of interest when it has an asset-sensitive gap and generally from decreasing market rates of interest when it is liability sensitive. The Company currently is asset sensitive within the one-year time frame based on effective GAP which uses behavioral assumptions that model the rate sensitivity of non-maturity deposits by looking at the deposits’ behavior rather than their contractual ability to re-price. The cash flows used in the analysis are the projected dollars of assets and liabilities that “reprice” (including maturities, repricing, likely calls, prepayments, etc.). However, the Company's gap analysis is not a precise indicator of its interest sensitivity position. The analysis presents only a static view of the timing of maturities and repricing opportunities, without taking into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally. For example, rates paid on a substantial portion of core deposits may change contractually within a relatively short time frame, but those rates are viewed by management as significantly less interest-sensitive than market-based rates such as those paid on non-core deposits. Accordingly, management believes a liability sensitive-position within one year would not be as indicative of the Company’s true interest sensitivity as it would be for an organization which depends to a greater extent on purchased funds to support earning assets. Net interest income is also affected by other significant factors, including changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.
The following tables depict, for the periods indicated, certain information related to interest rate sensitivity in net interest income and market value of equity:

Allowance and Provision for Credit Losses
On January 1, 2021, the Company adopted the ASC 326. The FASB issued ASC 326 to replace the incurred loss model for loans and other financial assets with an expected loss model and requires consideration of a wider range of reasonable and supportable information to determine credit losses. In accordance with ASC 326, the Company has developed an ACL methodology effective January 1, 2021, which replaces its previous allowance for loan losses methodology. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from loans’ amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans are charged-off against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off.
Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environment conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates, property values, or other relevant factors. Management may selectively apply external market data to subjectively adjust the Company’s own loss history including index or peer data. Management evaluates the adequacy of the ACL quarterly and makes provisions for credit losses based on this evaluation. See Note B - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a complete description of the Company’s methodology and the quantitative and qualitative factors included in the calculation.
Upon the adoption of ASC 326, the Company recorded a $397 thousand increase to the ACL. At December 31, 2021, the ACL was $30.7 million, or 1.0% of LHFI, a decrease of $5.1 million, or 14.2% when compared to December 31, 2020. The decrease is related to charge-offs taken on several loans during 2021 and was offset by a slight increase related to the ASC 326 transition entry. At December 31, 2020, the allowance for loan losses was approximately $35.8 million, which was 1.2% of LHFI. The Company maintains the allowance at a level that management believes is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Specifically, identifiable and quantifiable losses are immediately charged-off against the allowance; recoveries are generally recorded only when sufficient cash payments are received subsequent to the charge-off.
The provision for credit losses is a charge to earnings to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level consistent with management’s assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio in light of current economic conditions and market trends. The Company’s provision for credit losses was a negative $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the provision for loan losses was $25.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The improved macroeconomic outlook for 2021 and the Company’s ACL calculation under ASC 326 resulted in a negative provision for 2021. The $21.4 million increase in 2020 was related to our estimates of probable incurred losses associated with COVID-19 pandemic.
At December 31, 2021, management believes the allowance is appropriate and has been derived from consistent application of our methodology. Should any of the factors considered by management in evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses change, management’s estimate of inherent losses in the portfolio could also change, which would affect the level of future provisions for loan losses. During the first quarter of 2020, the World Health Organization declared the spread of the COVID-19 virus to be a global pandemic. That has caused significant disruptions to the U.S. economy across all industries. With the number of diagnosed cases of the virus rising throughout the year, it is still impossible to foresee how long the pandemic will last and what effect it will have on the economy, or to what extent this crisis will impact the Company. All available industry statistics and trends, as well as internal tracking of loan repayment ability and payment forgiveness across the portfolio is being analyzed in an attempt to understand the correlation with asset quality and degree of possible deterioration. This ongoing analysis of the possibility of increasing credit losses resulted in the need for additional provision expense in 2020. If economic conditions worsen, further funding to the allowance may be required in future periods.
Allowance for Credit Losses on Off Balance Sheet Credit Exposures
On January 1, 2021, the Company adopted ASC 326. The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The ACL on off-balance sheet credit (“OBSC”) exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. Upon adoption of ASC 326, the Company recorded an ACL on unfunded commitments of $718 thousand. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a $352 thousand provision for credit losses on OBSC exposures.
Non-Performing Assets
A loan is placed on non-accrual and the accrual of interest discontinued, when based on all available information and events, it displays characteristics causing management to determine that the collection of all principal, interest, and other related fees due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement is not probable. Also identified along with these loans in nonaccrual status, are loans determined by management to be labelled as “troubled debt restructure” based on regulatory guidance, as well as loans 90 days or greater past due and still accruing interest.
Once these loans are identified, they are evaluated to determine whether the ultimate repayment source will be liquidation of collateral or some future source of cash flow. If the only source of repayment will come from the liquidation of collateral, they are analyzed and documented as to whether any impairment exists. This method considers collateral exposure, as well as all expected expenses related to the disposal of the collateral. If there is any impairment, specific allowances for these loans are then accounted for on a per loan basis. Loans that are identified as criticized or classified based on unsatisfactory repayment performance, or other evidence of deteriorating credit quality, are not reviewed until they meet one of the three criteria described above.
Total nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2021, were $28.0 million, a decrease of $5.8 million compared to $33.8 million at December 31, 2020. A majority of the decrease is related to charge-offs of $4.8 million during 2021. Management believes these relationships were adequately reserved at December 31, 2021. Restructured loans not reported as past due or nonaccrual at December 31, 2021 totaled $5.2 million. See Note E - Loans in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a description of restructured loans.
A potential problem loan is one in which management has serious doubts about the borrower’s future performance under the terms of the loan contract and does not meet the standard of a non-performing asset as outlined by regulatory guidance. These loans may or may not be current as to principal and interest repayment, but they still possess some asset quality characteristics that give management a reason to believe that repayment in full under the contractual terms of the agreement are possible. The level of potential problem loans is one factor used in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, The First had potential problem loans of $154.8 million and $161.7 million, respectively. The decrease of $6.9 million during 2021 was largely attributable to the related charge-offs mentioned above.
Summary of Loan Loss Experience
Consolidated Allowance for Credit Losses
(1)
Effective January 1, 2021, The Company adopted ASC 326 using the modified retrospective approach; therefore, prior period balances are presented under legacy GAAP.
(2)
The negative provision of $1.1 million for credit losses on the consolidated statements of income includes a $1.5 million negative loan loss provision and a $352 thousand provision for OBSC exposures for the year ended December 31, 2021.
At December 31, 2021, allowance as of percent of total loans decreased 0.10% to 1.04% when compared to 1.14% at December 31, 2020. The decrease is attributed to the $1.5 million in negative credit loss and a $177.9 million decrease in loans outstanding at year end compared the year end 2020. At December 31, 2021, nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total loans decreased 0.13% to 0.94% when compared to 1.07% at December 31, 2020. The decrease is attributed to a $5.8 million decrease in nonaccrual loans and a decrease in loans outstanding mentioned above.
At December 31, 2021, the components of the ACL consisted of the following ($ in thousands):

Non-interest Income
The Company's primary sources of non-interest income are mortgage banking operations and service charges on deposit accounts. Other sources of non-interest income include bankcard fees, commissions on check sales, safe deposit box rent, wire transfer fees, official check fees and bank owned life insurance income.
Non-interest income was $37.5 million at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $4.4 million or 10.5% compared to December 31, 2020. The decrease includes a $7.6 million decrease in the bargain purchase gain and loss on the sale of land, a decrease in mortgage income of $1.6 million, an increase of $1.1 million in other income and an increase in interchange fees of $2.1 million. Non-interest income was $41.9 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $14.9 million or 55.4% compared to December 31, 2019. The increase includes an $8.3 million, net of tax, bargain purchase gain and sale of land, an increase in mortgage income of $4.5 million and an increase in interchange fee income of $1.4 million.
Non-interest Expense
Non-interest expense was $114.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $8.2 million, or 7.7% in year-over-year comparison. An increase of $4.6 million in salaries and employee benefits and an increase of $1.7 million in occupancy expense contributed to the increase. Non-interest expense was $106.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $17.8 million compared to December 31, 2019, of which $12.3 million is related to the operations of FFB and SWG. The remaining
increase of $5.5 million in expenses are related to increases in salaries and employee benefits of $6.3 million and increases in occupancy of $386 thousand. Other expenses decreased $1.2 million in the year-over-year comparison.
The following table sets forth the primary components of non-interest expense for the periods indicated ($ in thousands):
Non-interest Expense
Amounts previously reported have been adjusted to reflect the breakout of acquisition expenses. Total non-interest expense did not change.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense consists of two components. The first is the current tax expense which represents the expected income tax to be paid to taxing authorities. The Company also recognizes deferred tax for future income/deductible amounts resulting from differences in the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Income tax expense was $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company’s effective income tax rate was 20.9%, 16.8% and 22.5% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective tax rate differs each year primarily due to our investments in bank-qualified municipal securities, bank-owed life insurance, and certain merger related expenses. The increase in the Company’s effective rate for 2021 compared 2020 was primarily due to the $6.9 million, non-taxable, decrease in the bargain purchase gain. The reduction in the Company’s effective rate for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to the $7.8 million, non-taxable, bargain purchase gain related to the SWG acquisition and the CARES Act that was signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act includes several significant provisions for corporations including increasing the amount of deductible interest under section 163(j), allowing companies to carryback certain net operating losses, and increasing the amount of net operating loss that corporations can use to offset income. Income taxes are discussed more fully under Note K - Income Tax of this report.
Analysis of Financial Condition
Earning Assets
Loans. Loans typically provide higher yields than the other types of earning assets, and thus one of the Company's goals is for loans to be the largest category of the Company's earning assets. At December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, average loans accounted for 60.8%, 71.0% and 76.5% of average earning assets. Management attempts to control and counterbalance the inherent credit and liquidity risks associated with the higher loan yields without sacrificing asset quality to achieve its asset mix goals. Loans,
excluding mortgage loans held for sale, averaged $3.020 billion during 2021 and $3.020 billion during 2020, as compared to $2.341 billion during 2019.
In the context of this discussion, a "real estate mortgage loan" is defined as any loan, other than loans for construction purposes, secured by real estate, regardless of the purpose of the loan. The Company follows the common practice of financial institutions in the Company’s market area of obtaining a security interest in real estate whenever possible, in addition to any other available collateral. This collateral is taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan and tends to increase the magnitude of the real estate loan portfolio component. Generally, the Company limits its loan-to-value ratio to 80%. Management attempts to maintain a conservative philosophy regarding its underwriting guidelines and believes it will reduce the risk elements of its loan portfolio through strategies that diversify the lending mix.
Loans held for sale consist of mortgage loans originated by the Bank and sold into the secondary market. Commitments from investors to purchase the loans are obtained upon origination.
The following table sets forth the Company’s commercial and construction real estate loans maturing within specified intervals at December 31, 2021 ($ in thousands):
Loan Maturity Schedule and Sensitivity to Changes in Interest Rates
The information presented in the above table is based on the contractual maturities of the individual loans, including loans which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity. Renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval, as well as modification of terms upon their maturity.
Investment Securities. The investment securities portfolio is a significant component of the Company’s total earning assets. Total securities averaged $1.305 billion in 2021, as compared to $917.9 million in 2020, and $636.0 million in 2019. This represents 26.3%, 21.6%, and 20.8% of the average earning assets for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2021, investment securities, including equity securities, were $1.774 billion and represented 29.6% of earning assets. The Company attempts to maintain a portfolio of high quality, highly liquid investments with returns competitive with short-term U.S. Treasury or agency obligations. This objective is particularly important as the Company focuses on growing its loan portfolio. The
Company primarily invests in securities of U.S. Government agencies, municipals, and corporate obligations with maturities up to ten years.
Short-Term Investments. Short-term investments, consisting of Federal Funds Sold, funds due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks, averaged $642.0 million in 2021, $317.8 million in 2020, and $84.2 million in 2019. There were no federal funds sold at December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. These funds are a primary source of the Company's liquidity and are generally invested in an earning capacity on an overnight basis.
Deposits
Deposits. Average total deposits at December 31, 2021 were $4.631 billion, an increase of $713.7 thousand, or 18.2% compared to 2020. Average total deposits at December 31, 2020 were $3.918 billion, an increase of $1.118 billion, or 39.9% compared to $2.799 billion in 2019. At December 31, 2021, total deposits were $5.227 billion, compared to $4.215 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $1.012 billion, or 24.0%, and $3.077 billion at December 31, 2019. Deposits of $410.2 million were acquired in 2021 with the acquisition of the Cadence branches. Deposits of $476.1 million were acquired in 2020 with the acquisition of SWG. Deposits of $686.4 million were acquired in 2019 with the acquisitions of FPB and FFB.
The Company implemented Deposit Reclassification at the beginning of 2020. This program reclassifies non-interest-bearing deposits and NOW deposit balances to money market accounts. This program reduces our reserve balance required at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and provides additional funds for liquidity or lending. At December 31, 2021, $794.3 million in non-interest deposit balances and $1.032 billion in NOW deposit accounts were reclassified as money market accounts. A distribution of the Company’s deposits with reclassification showing the average balances of deposits by type and weighted-average rates paid during the years presented ($ in thousands):
Average deposits increased $738.4 million, or 18.7%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The most significant growth during 2021 compared to 2020 was in money market accounts. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits and total deposits was 0.27% and 0.26% during 2021 compared to 0.53% and 0.49% in 2020. The decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing deposit during 2021 compared to 2020 was related to lower average interest rates paid on most of our interest-bearing deposit products as a result of lower average market interest rates.
The Company’s loan-to-deposit ratio, which excludes mortgage loans held for sale, was 56.6% at December 31, 2021, 74.1% at December 31, 2020 and 84.5% at December 31, 2019. The loan-to-deposit ratio averaged 65.2% during 2021. Core deposits, which exclude time deposits of $250,000 or more in 2021 and time deposits of $100,000 or more in 2020 and 2019, provide a relatively stable funding source for the Company's loan portfolio and other earning assets. The Company's core deposits were $4.504 billion at December 31, 2021, $3.853 billion at December 31, 2020, and $2.650 billion at December 31, 2019. Management anticipates that a stable base of deposits will be the Company's primary source of funding to meet both its short-term and long-term liquidity needs in the future. The Company has purchased brokered deposits from time to time to help fund loan growth. Brokered deposits and jumbo certificates of deposit generally carry a higher interest rate than traditional core deposits. Further, brokered deposit customers typically do not have loan or other relationships with the Company. The Company has adopted a policy not to permit brokered deposits to represent more than 10% of all of the Company’s deposits. Transaction account balances were above normal as of December 31, 2020, due to PPP loan proceeds.
Maturities of Certificates of Deposit
of $250,000 or More
Borrowed Funds
Borrowed funds consist of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas (“FHLB”), loans from First Horizon Bank, federal funds purchased and reverse repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2021, advances from the FHLB totaled $0 compared to $110.0 million at December 31, 2020 and $206.3 million at December 31, 2019. The advances are collateralized by a blanket lien on the first mortgage loans in the amount of the outstanding borrowings, FHLB capital stock, and amounts on deposit with the FHLB. There were $0, $0 and $2.7 million federal funds purchased at December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. As part of the FFB acquisition, the Company assumed two loans in the amount of $3.5 million and $2.0 million with First Horizon Bank. Principal and interest are payable quarterly at rates ranging from 3.80% - 4.10%. In 2021, the Company repaid the two loans acquired from the FFB acquisition.
Subordinated Debentures
In 2006, the Company issued subordinated debentures of $4.1 million to The First Bancshares, Inc. Statutory Trust 2 (“Trust 2”). The Company is the sole owner of the equity of the Trust 2. The Trust 2 issued $4,000,000 of preferred securities to investors. The Company makes interest payments and will make principal payments on the debentures to the Trust 2. These payments will be the source of funds used to retire the preferred securities, which are redeemable at any time beginning in 2011 and thereafter, and mature in 2036. The Company entered into this arrangement to provide funding for expected growth.
In 2007, the Company issued subordinated debentures of $6.2 million to The First Bancshares, Inc. Statutory Trust 3 (“Trust 3”). The Company is the sole owner of the equity of the Trust 3. The Trust 3 issued $6,000,000 of preferred securities to investors. The Company makes interest payments and will make principal payments on the debentures to the Trust 3. These payments will be the source of funds used to retire the preferred securities, which are redeemable at any time beginning in 2012 and thereafter, and mature in 2037. The Company entered into this arrangement to provide funding for expected growth.
In 2018, the Company acquired FMB’s Capital Trust 1 (“Trust 1”), which consisted of $6.1 million of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures in which the Company owns all of the common equity. The Company is the sole owner of the equity of Trust 1. The Trust 1 issued $6,000,000 of preferred securities to investors. The Company makes interest payments and will make principal payments on the debentures to the Trust 1. These payments will be the source of funds used to retire the preferred securities, which are redeemable at any time beginning in 2008 and thereafter, and mature in 2033.
Subordinated Notes
April 30, 2018, the Company entered into two Subordinated Note Purchase Agreements pursuant to which the Company sold and issued $24.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.875% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2028 and $42.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.40% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2033 (collectively, the “Notes”). Deferred issuance costs included in the subordinated debt were $961 thousand and $1.1 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
The Notes are not convertible into or exchangeable for any other securities or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The Notes are not subject to redemption at the option of the holder. Principal and interest on the Notes are subject to acceleration only in limited circumstances. The Notes are unsecured, subordinated obligations of the Company and rank junior in right to payment to the Company’s current and future senior indebtedness, and each Note is pari passu in right to payment with respect to the other Notes. The Company entered into this arrangement to provide funding for expected growth.
On September 25, 2020, the Company entered into a Subordinated Note Purchase Agreement with certain qualified institutional buyers pursuant to which the Company sold and issued $65.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 4.25% Fixed to Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2030. The Notes are unsecured and have a ten-year term, maturing October 1, 2030, and will bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 4.25%, payable semi-annually in arrears, for the first five years of the term. Thereafter, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to a benchmark rate (which is expected to be the Three-Month Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus 412.6 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears. As provided in the Notes, under specified conditions the interest rate on the Notes during the applicable floating rate period may be determined based on a rate other than Three-Month Term SOFR. The Company is entitled to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, on any interest payment date on or after October 1, 2025, and to redeem the Notes at any time in whole upon certain other specified events.
The Company had $144.7 million of subordinated debt, net of deferred issuance costs $2.1 million and unamortized fair value mark $646 thousand, at December 31, 2021, compared to $144.6 million, net of deferred issuance costs $2.2 million and unamortized fair value mark $700 thousand, at December 31, 2020.
Capital
The Federal Reserve Board and bank regulatory agencies require bank holding companies and financial institutions to maintain capital at adequate levels based on a percentage of assets and off-balance sheet exposures, adjusted for risk weights ranging from 0% for U.S government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures. In November 2019, the federal banking agencies adopted a rule revising the scope of commercial real estate mortgages subject to a 150% risk weight. Under the risk-based standard, capital is classified into two tiers. Tier 1 capital consists of common stockholders’ equity, excluding the unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale securities, minus certain intangible assets. Tier 2 capital consists of the general reserve for loan losses, subject to certain limitations. An institution’s total risk-based capital for purposes of its risk-based capital ratio consists of the sum of its Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. The risk-based regulatory minimum requirements are 6% for Tier 1 and 8% for total risk-based capital.
Bank holding companies and banks are also required to maintain capital at a minimum level based on total assets, which is known as the leverage ratio. The minimum requirement for the leverage ratio is 4%. All but the highest rated institutions are required to maintain ratios 100 to 200 basis points above the minimum. The Company and The First exceeded their minimum regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation approved final capital rules in July 2013, that substantially amended the existing capital rules for banks. These new rules reflect, in part, certain standards initially adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2010 (which standards are commonly referred to as “Basel III”) as well as requirements contemplated by the Dodd-Frank Act.
Under the Basel III capital rules, the Company is required to meet certain minimum capital requirements that differ from past capital requirements. The rules implement a new capital ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets. Common equity Tier 1 capital generally consists of retained earnings and common stock (subject to certain adjustments) as well as accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), however, the Company exercised a one-time irrevocable option to exclude certain components of AOCI as of March 31, 2015. The Company is required to establish a “conservation buffer,” consisting of a common equity Tier 1 capital amount equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets effective January 2019. An institution that does not meet the conservation buffer will be subject to restrictions on certain activities including payment of dividends, stock repurchases, and discretionary bonuses to executive officers.
The prompt corrective action rules have been modified to include the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio and to increase the Tier 1 capital ratio requirements for the various thresholds. For example, the requirements for the Company to be considered well-capitalized under the rules include a 5.0% leverage ratio, a 6.5% common equity Tier 1capital ratio, an 8.0% Tier 1 capital ratio, and a 10.0% total capital ratio.
The rules modify the manner in which certain capital elements are determined. The rules make changes to the methods of calculating the risk-weighting of certain assets, which in turn affects the calculation of the risk-weighted capital ratios. Higher risk weights are assigned to various categories of assets, including commercial real estate loans, credit facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property, certain exposures or credit that are 90 days past due or are nonaccrual, securitization exposures, and in certain cases mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets.
The Company was required to comply with the new capital rules on January 1, 2015, with a measurement date of March 31, 2015. The conservation buffer was phased-in beginning in 2016, and took full effect on January 1, 2019. Certain calculations under the rules will also have phase-in periods. Under this guidance banking institutions with a CETI, Tier 1 Capital Ratio and Total Risk Based Capital above the minimum regulatory adequate capital ratios but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on their ability to pay dividends, repurchase equity and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers, based on the amount of the shortfall.
On December 14, 2021, the U.S. Department of Treasury informed the Company of its eligibility to receive $175.0 million of non-dilutive Tier 1 perpetual preferred capital under the ECIP. Established by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, the ECIP was created to encourage low-and moderate-income community financial institutions to augment their efforts to support small businesses and consumers in their communities.
Analysis of Capital
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity management involves monitoring the Company’s sources and uses of funds in order to meet its day-to-day cash flow requirements while maximizing profits. Liquidity represents the ability of a company to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities. Liquidity management is made more complicated because different balance sheet components are subject to varying degrees of management control. For example, the timing of maturities of the investment portfolio is very predictable and subject to a high degree of control at the time investment decisions are made; however, net deposit inflows and outflows are far less predictable and are not subject to the same degree of control. Asset liquidity is provided by cash and assets which are readily marketable, which can be pledged, or which will mature in the near future. Liability liquidity is provided by access to core funding sources, principally the ability to generate customer deposits in the Company’s market area.
The Company’s federal funds sold position, which includes funds due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks, is typically its primary source of liquidity. Federal funds sold averaged $642.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 and averaged $317.8 million at December 31, 2020. In addition, the Company has available advances from the FHLB. Advances available are generally based upon the amount of qualified first mortgage loans which can be used for collateral. At December 31, 2021, advances available totaled approximately $1.478 billion, of which $5.2 million had been drawn, or used for letters of credit.
As of December 31, 2021, the market value of unpledged debt securities plus pledged securities in excess of current pledging requirements comprised $985.4 million of the Company’s investment balances, compared to $513.2 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in unpledged debt securities from December 2021 compared to December 2020 is primarily due to an increase in acquired deposits. Other forms of balance sheet liquidity include but are not necessarily limited to any outstanding federal funds sold and vault cash. Management believes that available investments and other potentially liquid assets, along with the standby funding sources it has arranged, are more than sufficient to meet the Company’s current and anticipated short-term liquidity needs.
The Company’s liquidity ratio as of December 31, 2021 was 41.1%, as compared to internal liquidity policy guidelines of 10% minimum. Other liquidity ratios reviewed include the following along with policy guidelines for the periods indicated:
Continued growth in core deposits and relatively high levels of potentially liquid investments have had a positive impact on our liquidity position in recent periods, but no assurance can be provided that our liquidity will continue at current robust levels.
The holding company’s primary uses of funds are ordinary operating expenses and stockholder dividends, and its primary source of funds is dividends from the Bank since the holding company does not conduct regular banking operations. Management anticipates that the Bank will have sufficient earnings to provide dividends to the holding company to meet its funding requirements for the foreseeable future.
Management regularly reviews the liquidity position of the Company and has implemented internal policies which establish guidelines for sources of asset-based liquidity and limit the total amount of purchased funds used to support the balance sheet and funding from non-core sources. During March 2020, in response to COVID-19, the Federal Reserve lowered the primary credit rate by 150 basis points to 0.25 percent and extended terms to 90 days to enhance market liquidity and encourage use of the discount window. In addition, the Federal Reserve announced it would begin quantitative easing, or large-scale asset purchases, consisting primarily of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities to stem the effects of the pandemic on the financial markets. A prolonged outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic could cause a widespread liquidity crisis, and the availability of these funds or the options to sell securities currently held could be hindered. The full impact and duration of COVID-19 on our business is unknown but if it continues to curtail economic activity, it could impact our ability to obtain funding and result in the reduction of or the cessation of dividends.
On March 28, 2019, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to purchase up to an aggregate of $20 million of the Company’s common stock (the “March 2019 program”). This share repurchase program had an expiration date of December 31, 2019. Under the March 2019 program, the Company could repurchase shares of its common stock periodically in a manner determined by the Company’s management. The actual means and timing of purchase, target number of shares and maximum price or range of prices under the program was determined by management at its discretion and depended on a number of factors, including the market price of the Company’s common stock, general market and economic conditions, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The Company repurchased 168,188 shares under the March 2019 program in 2019.
On May 7, 2020, the Company announced the renewal of its share repurchase program that previously expired on December 31, 2019. Under the program, the Company could from time to time repurchase up to $15 million in shares of its common stock in any manner determined appropriate by the Company's management. The actual timing and method of any purchases, the target number of shares and the maximum price (or range of prices) under the program, was determined by management at its discretion and depended on a number of factors, including the market price of the Company's common stock, general market and economic conditions, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The renewed share repurchase program expired on December 31, 2020. The Company repurchased 289,302 shares in 2020 pursuant to the program.
On December 16, 2020, the Company announced that its Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program (the “2021 Repurchase Program”), pursuant to which the Company may purchase up to an aggregate of $30 million in shares of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock. Under the program, the Company could, but is not required to, from time to time repurchase up $30 million of its own common stock in any manner determined appropriate by the Company’s management. The actual timing and method of any purchases, the target number of shares and the maximum price (or range of prices) under the program, was be determined by management at is discretion and depended on a number of factors, including the market price of the Company’s common stock, general market and economic conditions, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

Impact of Inflation
Unlike most industrial companies, the assets and liabilities of financial institutions such as the Company are primarily monetary in nature. Therefore, interest rates have a more significant effect on the Company’s performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and change in prices. In addition, interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. As discussed previously, management seeks to manage the relationships between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations, including those resulting from inflation.
