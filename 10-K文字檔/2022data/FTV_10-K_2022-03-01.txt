ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Fortive Corporation (the “Company,” “Fortive,” “we,” “our,” and “us”) is a provider of essential technologies for connected workflow solutions across a range of attractive end-markets. Our strategic segments - Intelligent Operating Solutions, Precision Technologies, and Advanced Healthcare Solutions - include well-known brands with leading positions in their markets. Our businesses design, develop, manufacture, and service professional and engineered products, software, and services, building upon leading brand names, innovative technologies, and significant market positions. We are headquartered in Everett, Washington and employ a team of more than 18,000 research and development, manufacturing, sales, distribution, service, and administrative employees in more than 50 countries around the world.
This MD&A is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. Our MD&A is divided into seven sections:
•Basis of Presentation
•Overview
•Results of Operations
•Financial Instruments and Risk Management
•Liquidity and Capital Resources
•Critical Accounting Estimates
•New Accounting Standards
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
On October 9, 2020, we completed the separation of Vontier Corporation (“Vontier”), the entity we created to hold our former Industrial Technologies segment (the “Separation”). The accounting requirements for reporting the Vontier business as a discontinued operation were met when the Separation was completed. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements reflect the results of the Vontier business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.
OVERVIEW
General
Fortive is a multinational business with global operations with approximately 49% of our sales derived from customers outside the United States in 2021. As a company with global operations, our businesses are affected by worldwide, regional, and industry-specific economic and political factors. Our geographic and industry diversity, as well as the range of products, software, and services we offer, typically help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country (except for the United States) on our operating results. Given the broad range of products manufactured, software and services provided, and geographies served, we do not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the Company. Our individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including their sales, to the extent possible, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future.
As a result of our geographic and industry diversity, we face a variety of opportunities and challenges, including technological development in most of the markets we serve, the expansion and evolution of opportunities in high-growth markets, trends and costs associated with a global labor force, and consolidation of our competitors. We define high-growth markets as developing markets of the world experiencing extended periods of accelerated growth in gross domestic product and infrastructure which include Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Asia with the exception of Japan and Australia. We operate in a highly competitive business environment in most markets, and our long-term growth and profitability will depend, in particular, on our ability to expand our business across geographies and market segments, identify, consummate, and integrate appropriate acquisitions, develop innovative and differentiated new products, services, and software, expand and improve the effectiveness of our sales force, continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, attract relevant talent and retain, grow, and empower our talented workforce, and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated environment. We are making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address technological change in the markets we serve and to improve our manufacturing, research and development, and customer-facing resources in order to be responsive to our customers throughout the world.
In this report, references to sales from existing businesses refer to sales from operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) but excluding (1) the impact from acquired businesses and (2) the impact of currency translation. References to sales attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to GAAP sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition and the effect of purchase accounting adjustments of the acquisition less the amount of sales attributable to certain divested businesses or product lines not considered discontinued operations prior to the first anniversary of the divestiture. The portion of sales attributable to the impact of currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in sales (excluding sales impact from acquired businesses) and (b) the period-to-period change in sales (excluding sales impact from acquired businesses) after applying the current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. Sales from existing businesses should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, sales, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Management believes that reporting the non-GAAP financial measure of sales from existing businesses provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating comparisons of our sales performance with our performance in prior and future periods and to our peers. We exclude the effect of acquisition and divestiture related items because the nature, size, and number of such transactions can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers. We exclude the effect of currency translation from sales from existing businesses because the impact of currency translation is not under management’s control and is subject to volatility. Management believes the exclusion of the effect of acquisitions and divestitures and currency translation may facilitate the assessment of underlying business trends and may assist in comparisons of long-term performance. References to sales volume refer to the impact of both price and unit sales.
Business Performance and Outlook
Business Performance
Overall demand for our products and services accelerated during 2021, with aggregate year-over-year sales increasing by 13.4%. The increase was largely driven by demand from our existing businesses, which increased by 9.5% on broad-based momentum and focused execution across our portfolio, most notably within our short-cycle industrial and software as a service (“SaaS”) businesses.
Geographically, year-over-year sales from existing businesses in developed markets increased at a high single digit rate driven by high single digit increases in North America and Western Europe. Year-over-year sales from existing businesses in high
growth markets increased at a mid-teens rate driven by mid-twenties increases in Latin America and mid-teens increases in China.
In addition to increased demand, year-over-year price increases contributed 1.8% to sales growth during 2021, as compared to 2020, and is reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.
During 2021, widespread supply chain challenges emerged due to labor, raw material, and component shortages, as well as logistics issues, across multiple industries, resulting in increased material and shipping costs. We worked to mitigate the impact of the supply chain challenges by implementing solutions to support near-term operations, executing on countermeasures for material shortages, and managing production, all of which contributed to year-over-year revenue growth and margin expansion in 2021. However, due to the magnitude of the supply chain and logistics issues impacting the economy broadly and those related to electronic components in particular, demand for our products outpaced our ability to supply, and our backlog grew in the second half of 2021.
COVID-19 continues to have an impact on our business and results. In 2020, we experienced significant declines in demand as a result of broad disruption in the global economy. In 2021, we experienced a rebound of demand but also encountered operating challenges related to logistics, material availability and higher levels of absenteeism. We expect that the pandemic and its impact on global commerce will remain uncertain and we will continue to deploy FBS to countermeasure the challenges we encounter.
2022 Outlook
We anticipate the strong demand for our products and services will continue into 2022 with year-over-year revenue expected to increase between 9.0% and 12.0% for the full year, including growth from existing businesses of between 5.5% and 8.5% on anticipated strong demand in key end markets and continued deployment of FBS to drive share gains and innovation. This outlook is subject to various assumptions and risks, including but not limited to, the magnitude of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on macroeconomic conditions, continued strength of key end markets, elective surgery rates, the availability of electronic components, our ability to convert backlog, sustain our workforce levels and maintain manufacturing capacity.
We anticipate that supply chain and inflationary pressures will persist throughout 2022 and that although our backlog may decline compared to 2021, it may remain elevated compared to historical levels. We will continue to deploy FBS to actively manage production challenges, collaborate with customers and suppliers to minimize disruptions and utilize price increases and other countermeasures to offset inflationary pressures. We are monitoring the risks of new COVID-19 variants which may be more contagious or severe, or less responsive to treatment and vaccines, and may impact the rate that virus control measures ease or become more restrictive, which could impact our future results.
We are monitoring matters of international trade, monetary and fiscal policies, relations between the U.S. and China, as well as evaluating the impacts of proposed legislation and various investment and taxation policy initiatives being debated in the United States and by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”). As of the filing date of this report, we are, however, unable to quantify the anticipated impact of these matters on our financial results.
Completed Divestitures, Acquisitions, and Business Combinations
ServiceChannel Acquisition
On August 24, 2021, we acquired ServiceChannel Holdings, Inc. (“ServiceChannel”), a privately held, global provider of SaaS based multi-site facilities maintenance service solutions with an integrated service-provider network. The acquisition of ServiceChannel broadens our offering of software-enabled solutions for the facility and asset lifecycle workflow. The total consideration paid was approximately $1.2 billion, net of acquired cash, and includes approximately $28 million of deferred compensation consideration that is being recognized ratably over a twelve month service period. The ServiceChannel acquisition was primarily financed with available cash and proceeds from our financing activities. We preliminarily recorded approximately $873 million of goodwill related to the ServiceChannel acquisition, which is not tax deductible. ServiceChannel had revenue in 2020 of approximately $70 million and is an operating company within our Intelligent Operating Solutions segment.
Provation Acquisition
On December 27, 2021, we acquired Provation Software, Inc. (“Provation”), a leading provider of clinical workflow software solutions used in hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers. The acquisition of Provation extends our digital offering and software capabilities in the healthcare space. The total consideration paid was approximately $1.4 billion, net of acquired cash
and was primarily financed with proceeds from our financing activities and available cash. We preliminarily recorded $970 million of goodwill related to the acquisition, which is not tax deductible. Provation had revenue in 2020 of approximately $90 million and is an operating company within our Advanced Healthcare Solutions segment.
Vontier Separation
On October 9, 2020, we completed the Separation by distributing 80.1% of the outstanding shares of Vontier to our stockholders on a pro rata basis. To effect the Separation, we distributed to our stockholders two shares of Vontier common stock for every five shares of Fortive common stock outstanding held on September 25, 2020, the record date for the distribution, and retained 19.9% of the shares of Vontier common stock immediately following the Separation. The accounting requirements for reporting the Separation of Vontier as a discontinued operation were met when the Separation was completed.
On September 29, 2020, Vontier entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks, consisting of a three-year, $800 million senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility (the “Three-Year Term Loans”), a two-year, $1 billion senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility (the “Two-Year Term Loans” and together with the “Three-Year Term Loans”, the “Term Loans”) and a three-year, $750 million senior unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility” and, together with the Term Loans, the “Credit Facilities”). On the Distribution Date, Vontier drew down the full $1.8 billion available under the Term Loans. Vontier used the proceeds from the Term Loans to make payments to the Company, with $1.6 billion used as part of the consideration for the contribution of certain assets and liabilities to Vontier by the Company in connection with the Separation and $202 million used as an adjustment for excess cash balances remaining with Vontier (collectively, the “Cash Consideration”). We applied the Cash Consideration to repay certain outstanding indebtedness, interest on certain debt instruments, and to pay certain of the Company’s regular, quarterly cash dividends. Refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for the description of the debt repayments made.
On January 19, 2021, we completed the Debt-for-Equity Exchange of 33.5 million shares of common stock of Vontier, representing all of the Retained Vontier Shares, for $1.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness of the Company held by Goldman Sachs & Co., including (i) all $400.0 million of the Term Loan due March 2021 and (ii) $683.2 million of the Term Loan due May 2021. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of the debt included in the Debt-for-Equity Exchange of $94.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021.
In preparation for and executing the Separation, the Company incurred $84 million and $35 million in Vontier stand-up and separation-related transaction costs during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which have been reclassified to discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. These stand-up and separation-related costs primarily relate to professional and advisory fees associated with preparation of regulatory filings and separation activities within finance, tax, legal, and information system functions.
In connection with the Separation, Fortive and Vontier entered into various agreements to effect the Separation and provide a framework for Vontier’s relationship with Fortive after the Separation, including a transition services agreement, an employee matters agreement, a tax matters agreement, an intellectual property matters agreement, a FBS license agreement, and a stockholder’s and registration rights agreement. These agreements govern the separation between Fortive and Vontier of the assets, employees, liabilities, and obligations (including its investments, property, and employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) of Fortive and its subsidiaries attributable to periods prior to, at, and after Vontier’s separation, and also govern certain relationships between Fortive and Vontier after the Separation. As of December 31, 2021, all responsibilities and obligations under all agreements have been materially settled.
Advanced Sterilization Products Acquisition
On April 1, 2019 (the “Principal Closing Date”), we acquired the Advanced Sterilization Products business (“ASP”) of Johnson & Johnson, a New Jersey corporation (“Johnson & Johnson”) for an aggregate purchase price of $2.7 billion (the “Transaction”), subject to certain post-closing adjustments set forth in a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement, dated effective as of June 6, 2018, between the Company and Ethicon, Inc., a New Jersey corporation (“Ethicon”) and a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. ASP engages in the research, development, manufacture, marketing, distribution, and sale of low-temperature terminal sterilization and high-level disinfection products.
On the Principal Closing Date, we paid $2.7 billion in cash and obtained the transferred assets and assumed liabilities in 20 countries (“Principal Countries”), general patent and trademark assignments, and all transferred equity interests in ASP. ASP has operations in an additional 39 countries (“Non-Principal Countries”). The transferred assets and liabilities associated with these operations close when requirements of country-specific agreements or regulatory approvals are satisfied.
The $2.7 billion purchase price was paid in exchange for ASP’s businesses in both Principal and Non-Principal Countries. As of December 31, 2021 we have closed all Principal Countries and all Non-Principal Countries. All of the provisional goodwill associated with the Transaction is included in goodwill in our Advanced Healthcare Solutions segment at December 31, 2021, and the majority of the provisional goodwill is tax deductible.
In addition, the Company entered into a transition services agreement with Johnson & Johnson for certain administrative and operational services (“TSA”) with Principal Countries and distribution agreements in the Non-Principal Countries. Under the distribution agreements, ASP sells finished goods to Ethicon at prices agreed by the parties. ASP recognizes these sales as revenue when the conditions for revenue recognition are met. Following the sale of finished goods by ASP, Ethicon obtains title of the finished goods, has full authority to sell and market the finished goods to end customers as it sees fit, and retains any revenue and profit from sale. As of December 31, 2021, ASP had exited the TSAs and substantially all of the distribution agreements.
Prior to our acquisition of ASP, Johnson & Johnson received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) regarding a False Claims Act investigation arising from a whistleblower lawsuit pertaining to the pricing, quality, marketing, and promotion of certain of ASP’s products. Based on the totality of available information at the Principal Closing Date and throughout the applicable measurement period, management allocated $26 million of the $2.7 billion purchase price to a potential liability related to the aforementioned litigation. Following the Principal Closing Date, management continually evaluated the likelihood and magnitude of the asserted claims based on any new information that became available. In the second quarter of 2021, following the unsealing of the whistleblower lawsuit and DOJ’s declination to intervene in the litigation, the plaintiff dismissed the whistleblower lawsuit. Based on these developments, management derecognized the litigation liability from our Consolidated Balance Sheet and recorded the gain on litigation resolution of $26 million within Non-operating income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Other Acquisitions and Investments
In addition to the acquisition of ASP, during 2019, we acquired Intelex Technologies and Pruftechnik, both of which complement existing businesses in our Intelligent Operation Solutions segment, and Censis Technologies within our Advanced Healthcare Solutions segment, for total consideration of $1.2 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. We recorded an aggregate of $781 million of goodwill related to these acquisitions.
At the closing date of the purchase of Censis Technologies, a contractual liability existed which management allocated to the purchase price and was recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the fourth quarter of 2021, that liability was discharged for an amount less than the amount allocated, and the excess was recorded as a Gain on litigation resolution of $3.9 million within Non-operating income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Combination of the Tektronix Video Business with Telestream
On July 20, 2019, we completed the combination of the Tektronix Video test and monitoring equipment business (“Tektronix Video Business”) with Telestream, LLC (the “Combined Business”), a portfolio company of Genstar Capital LLC. We recognized a pretax gain of $41 million upon the combination, and hold a 33% equity stake in the Combined Business. This transaction did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations reporting, and therefore the operating results of the Tektronix Video Business prior to the combination with Telestream are included in continuing operations for all periods presented. Additionally, the loss from our equity investment in the Combined Business is included in Other non-operating expenses, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Refer to Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

2020 COMPARED TO 2019
Year-over-year sales of products and services from existing businesses of Intelligent Operating Solutions declined 7.2% during the year ended December 31, 2020. The results were driven by declines in demand for portable gas detection instruments, on-premise software license and professional service offerings, and demand from our industrial channel partners, all of which were impacted by COVID-19 in both direct and adjacent end markets. Partially offsetting these declines was increased demand for our industrial imaging products and certain of our critical workflow, safety, and maintenance SaaS product offerings. Despite the year-over-year declines in demand from our industrial channel partners, we realized sequential improvement in both the third and fourth quarters of 2020 from the low point in the second quarter of 2020.
Geographically, demand from existing businesses in Intelligent Operating Solutions decreased on a year-over-year basis in both developed and high-growth markets as growth in Asia, led by Japan and China, was more than offset by declines in North America, Western Europe, and Latin America.

2020 COMPARED TO 2019
Year-over-year sales of products and services from existing businesses of Advanced Healthcare Solutions increased 0.6% during 2020 as increased demand for cell therapy equipment design and manufacturing, radiation safety monitoring, and surgical instrument tracking SaaS products was mostly offset by a decrease in demand for consumables from our ASP business driven by a decline in elective surgical procedure volumes. Year-over-year demand for sterilization capital equipment increased slightly during 2020 as compared to 2019. Several of our Advanced Healthcare Solutions businesses are impacted by elective surgical procedure volumes, and year-over-year, elective surgical procedure volumes declined at a high-single digit rate across most major geographic markets, at rates that varied throughout the year based on COVID-19 patient hospitalizations and virus control measures in place.

•Operating expense savings from broad cost reduction efforts and price increases, and to a lesser extent, lower year-over-year material costs, incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with productivity improvement initiatives, and foreign currency exchange rates, that more than offset lower year-over-year sales volumes from existing businesses and an unfavorable sales mix - favorable 40 basis points
•The year-over-year effect of amortization from existing businesses - favorable 250 basis points
•The incremental year-over-year effect of acquired businesses, including amortization and acquisition-related fair value adjustments to deferred revenue and inventory which were less in 2020 than in 2019 - favorable 160 basis points
•Acquisition-related transaction costs, as the costs related to our acquisition and integration of ASP and Censis in 2020 were less than the costs recognized in the comparable period in 2019 - favorable 450 basis points
•The incremental year-over-year net dilutive effect of restructuring actions - unfavorable 40 basis points
COST OF SALES AND GROSS PROFIT
The year-over-year increase in cost of sales during 2021, as compared to 2020, is due primarily to higher year-over-year sales volumes from existing businesses, incremental costs from our recently acquired businesses, increasing material, freight and logistics costs, and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, all of which were partially offset by lower operating costs and gains from productivity improvement initiatives.
The year-over-year increase in gross profit and gross profit margin during 2021 as compared to 2020 is due primarily to higher year-over-year sales volumes from existing businesses, sales volumes from our recent acquisitions, price increases, favorable sales mix, lower operating costs and gains from productivity improvements, all of which were partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher material, freight, and logistics costs.
The year-over-year decrease in cost of sales during 2020 as compared to 2019 is due primarily to lower year-over-year sales volumes from existing businesses, lower year-over-year material costs, year-over-year net cost savings associated with restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives, and changes in currency exchange rates, which were partially offset by incremental cost of sales from our recently acquired businesses.
The year-over-year increase in gross profit and gross profit margin during 2020 as compared to 2019 is due primarily to the favorable impacts of pricing improvements from existing businesses, incremental year-over-year net cost savings associated with restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives, material cost and supply chain improvement actions, and changes in currency exchange rates, which were partially offset by lower year-over-year sales volumes.
OPERATING EXPENSES
SG&A expenses increased during 2021 as compared to 2020 due to higher intangible amortization and incremental expenses from our recent acquisitions, higher employee compensation costs and SG&A expenses at our existing businesses due to broad cost reduction efforts executed in 2020 to better align with reductions in demand, and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, all of which was partially offset by reductions in net acquisition-related costs and incremental savings associated with restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives. On a year-over-year basis, SG&A expenses declined by 270 basis points, as a percentage of revenue, when compared to 2020, reflecting that demand for our products and services grew at a faster rate than expenses.
SG&A expenses increased during 2020 as compared to 2019 due primarily to higher intangible amortization and incremental expenses from our recently acquired businesses that were mostly offset by broad cost reduction efforts that reduced labor expenses to better align with reductions in demand during the second and third quarter of 2020, primarily through the use of furloughs and reductions in salaried compensation costs, as well as other reductions in discretionary spending. To a lesser
extent, year-over-year SG&A expenses were reduced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and year-over-year net cost savings associated with restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales were relatively consistent year-over-year.
R&D expenses (consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs) increased during 2021 as compared to 2020 due to targeted investments in key growth initiatives and innovation. On a year-over-year basis, R&D expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 10 basis points in 2021 as compared to 2020, reflecting demand for our products and services that grew at a faster rate than our investments in key growth initiatives and innovation.
R&D expenses (consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs) increased slightly during 2020 as compared to 2019 due to incremental expenses from recently acquired businesses. On a year-over-year basis, R&D expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 10 basis points in 2020 as compared to 2019 as incremental sales from our recently acquired businesses increased at a faster rate than R&D investments.
INTEREST COSTS
For a discussion of our outstanding indebtedness, refer to Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Interest expense, net of $103 million was recorded during 2021 compared to $149 million during 2020 and $143 million during 2019. Year-over-year interest expense decreased in 2021 and increased in 2020 due to changes in year-over-year average debt balances. In the event that additional liquidity is required, particularly in connection with acquisitions, we may enter into additional borrowings under our commercial paper programs or credit facilities, and/or access the capital markets. If we enter into such additional financing transactions, the amount of annual interest expense will increase.
UNREALIZED GAIN ON INVESTMENT IN VONTIER CORPORATION
On October 9, 2020, we completed the Vontier separation and retained 19.9% of the shares of Vontier common stock immediately following the Separation. We did not retain a controlling interest in Vontier and therefore the subsequent fair value changes of the Retained Vontier Shares are included in our results from continuing operations. At December 31, 2020, the Retained Vontier Shares were remeasured at fair value based on Vontier’s closing stock price, with unrealized gains of $1.1 billion recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
On January 19, 2021, we completed an exchange of all of the Retained Vontier Shares as part of a noncash debt-for-equity exchange that reduced outstanding indebtedness of Fortive by $1.1 billion.
INCOME TAXES
General
Income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in our financial statements. We record the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur.
Our effective tax rate can be affected by, among others, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns (as discussed below), the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies, tax rulings, court decisions, settlements with tax authorities, and changes in tax laws.
The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audit by federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. The Company is subject to examination in the United States, various states and foreign jurisdiction for the tax years 2010 to 2021. These examinations include filings of tax returns prior to our separation from Danaher, tax returns of enterprises no longer in our portfolio, and tax returns for pre-acquisition periods of enterprises added to our portfolio. Significant obligations are detailed in our tax matters agreements in connection with the separation of Fortive from Danaher on July 1, 2016, the split-off of the Automation and Specialty business on October 1, 2018, and the Vontier separation on October 9, 2020. We review our global tax positions on a quarterly basis. Based on these reviews, the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities, tax rulings and court decisions, and the expiration of statutes of limitations reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary.
We conduct business globally, and, as part of our global business, we file numerous income tax returns in the U.S. federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions. Our ability to obtain a tax benefit in certain countries that continue to have lower statutory tax
rates than the United States is dependent on our levels of taxable income in such foreign countries. We believe that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual foreign country would not typically have a material effect on our financial statements given the geographic dispersion of our taxable income.
Changes by the U.S. in relation to international tax reform could increase uncertainty and may adversely affect our income tax provision, cash taxes paid, and effective tax rate. Comprehensive tax reform was enacted under the TCJA which includes numerous provisions that affect businesses and introduces changes that impact U.S. corporate tax rates, business-related exclusions, deductions, and credits. The taxing authorities continue to issue regulations and guidance, some with retrospective application, to the provisions of the TCJA and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. Any future adjustments resulting from retrospective regulations and guidance issued will be considered as discrete income tax expense or benefit in the interim period the guidance is issued.
Furthermore, changes in multilateral agreements and the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the OECD and could significantly increase our tax provision, cash taxes paid, and effective tax rate. The OECD has issued significant global tax policy changes that include both expanded reporting as well as technical global tax policy changes and many countries in which we operate have implemented tax law and administrative changes to align with new OECD policies. The Company will continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of OECD policy changes.
For a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019
Our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was 9.3%, 3.7% and 20.4%, respectively.
Our effective tax rate for 2021 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to the effect of the TCJA U.S. federal permanent differences, the impact of credits and deductions provided by law, earnings outside the United States that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, and a permanent difference on the realized gain on our Retained Vontier Shares due to the tax-free treatment of our disposition of the shares through the Debt-for-Equity Exchange that was completed on January 19, 2021. The Debt-for-Equity Exchange included an exchange of all of our Vontier common stock owned as of December 31, 2020.
Our effective tax rate for 2020 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to the effect of the TCJA U.S. federal permanent differences, the impact of credits and deductions provided by law, earnings outside the United States that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, offset by tax costs associated with repatriating a portion of our previously reinvested earnings outside of the United States, and a permanent difference on the unrealized gain on our Retained Vontier Shares due to the tax-free treatment of our disposition of the shares through the Debt-for-Equity Exchange that was completed on January 19, 2021. The Debt-for-Equity Exchange included an exchange of all of our Vontier common stock owned as of December 31, 2020.
Our effective tax rate for 2019 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to the effect of the TCJA U.S. federal permanent differences, the impact of credits and deductions provided by law, and earnings outside the United States that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
Comprehensive income decreased by $1.1 billion in 2021 as compared to 2020, due to a decrease in net earnings of $1.0 billion, including both continuing and discontinued operations, unfavorable changes in foreign currency translation adjustments of $132 million, and favorable changes in pension benefit adjustments of $38 million. The decrease in net earnings was due to the recognition of a $1.1 billion unrealized gain on the Retained Vontier Shares in 2020.
Comprehensive income increased by $895 million in 2020 as compared to 2019, due to an increase in net earnings of $874 million, including both continuing and discontinued operations, favorable changes in foreign currency translation adjustments of $13 million, and favorable changes in pension benefit adjustments of $8 million. The increase in net earnings from 2019 to 2020 was due to the recognition of a $1.1 billion unrealized gain on the Retained Vontier Shares.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit risk and commodity prices, each of which could impact our financial statements. We generally address our exposure to these risks through our
normal operating and financing activities. In addition, our broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on our operating profit as a whole.
Interest Rate Risk
We manage interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. A change in interest rates on long-term debt impacts the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt but not our earnings or cash flows because the interest on such debt is fixed. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of December 31, 2021, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt by approximately $134 million.
As of December 31, 2021, our variable-rate debt obligations consisted primarily of U.S. dollar commercial paper and term loans (refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2021). As a result, our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short-term interest rates. As these shorter duration obligations mature, we anticipate issuing additional short-term commercial paper obligations and/or term loans to refinance all or part of these borrowings. The annual effective rate associated with our outstanding U.S. dollar denominated commercial paper and delayed-draw term loan was approximately 0.32% and 0.70%, respectively, and we recorded interest expense of $0.4 million on these variable-rate obligations. On an annualized basis, a hypothetical 10 basis points increase in market interest rates as of December 31, 2021 on our variable-rate debt obligations as of December 31, 2021 would have increased our interest expense by $1.37 million in 2021.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We face transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside of the United States and from intercompany transactions between affiliates. Transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than our functional currency or the functional currency of an applicable subsidiary. We also face translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars, our functional currency. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on our net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of equity. A 10% depreciation in major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2021 would have resulted in a reduction of foreign currency-denominated net assets and stockholders’ equity of approximately $198 million.
Currency exchange rates favorably impacted 2021 reported sales by 1.5% as compared to 2020, as the U.S. dollar was, on average, weaker against most major currencies during 2021 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2020. If the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2021 were to prevail throughout 2022, currency exchange rates would negatively impact 2022 estimated sales by approximately 1.0% relative to our performance in 2021. In general, additional weakening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would further positively impact our sales and results of operations on an overall basis and any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would adversely impact our sales and results of operations.
We have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales, profit, and assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements.
Credit Risk
We are exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instruments. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist of cash and highly-liquid investment grade cash equivalents and receivables from customers. We place cash and cash equivalents with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although we typically do not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, we regularly monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents. We emphasize safety and liquidity of principal over yield on those funds. In addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of our customers. Our businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when appropriate.
Commodity Price Risk
For a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. We generate substantial cash from operating activities and believe that our operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity, which consist of access to term loans, commercial paper, and our revolving credit facility, in addition to short-term liquidity benefits provided by cash repatriation will be sufficient to allow us to continue funding and investing in our existing businesses, consummate strategic acquisitions, make interest and principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness, fulfill our contractual obligations, and manage our capital structure on a short and long-term basis.
On March 27, 2020, the U.S. federal government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), an emergency economic stimulus package in response to the COVID-19 outbreak which, among other things, contains numerous income tax provisions and short-term liquidity assistance measures. During 2020, we deferred remittance of approximately $35 million in payroll tax payments with half subsequently remitted in December of 2021 and the remainder to be remitted in December of 2022.
While COVID-19 has created volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets, we have not realized a significant impact on our financial position, liquidity, or ability to meet our debt covenants as of the filing date of this Report; however, we continue to monitor the capital markets and general global economic conditions. The financial markets worldwide, including the United States, have been impacted by COVID-19 and this volatility and disruption during the first half of 2020 impacted broad access to the capital markets and pricing on new indebtedness. Our credit facilities, including our revolving credit facility, are predominately with institutions that we believe, to date, have been relatively unaffected by the disruption. Due to the volatility and disruption in the commercial paper markets during the first six months of 2020, we temporarily reduced our reliance on this source of funding, and consequently paid down and refinanced our outstanding commercial paper with the Term Loan that was initially due March 2021 and was retired in the Debt-for-Equity Exchange. In August 2021, we resumed borrowing under our Commercial Paper Program to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.
2021 Financing and Capital Transactions
On January 19, 2021, we completed a noncash exchange (the “Debt-for-Equity Exchange”) of 33,507,410 shares of common stock of Vontier, representing all of the Retained Vontier Shares, for $1.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness of the Company held by Goldman Sachs & Co., including (i) all $400 million in term loan outstanding under the $750 million delayed draw term loan facility (“Term Loan due March 2021”) and (ii) $683.2 million of the $1.0 billion in term loan outstanding under the $1.0 billion delayed draw term loan facility (“Term Loan due May 2021”).
On January 21, 2021, we repaid the remaining $316.8 million outstanding of the Term Loan due May 2021 using the cash proceeds received from Vontier in the Separation. The fees associated with the prepayment were immaterial.
On February 9, 2021, we repurchased $281 million of the 0.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the “Convertible Notes”) using the remaining cash proceeds received from Vontier in the Separation and other cash on hand. In connection with the repurchase, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of $104.9 million in the first quarter of 2021.
On July 1, 2021, all outstanding shares of our 5.0% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“MCPS”) converted at a rate of 14.0978 common shares per share of preferred stock into an aggregate of approximately 19.4 million shares (net of fractional shares) of the Company’s common stock, pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Designation governing the Series A Preferred Stock. Fortive issued cash in lieu of fractional shares of common stock in the conversion. These payments were recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. The final dividend of $12.50 per share, or $17.2 million in the aggregate, was paid on July 1, 2021. The impact of the MCPS calculated under the if-converted method was anti-dilutive for the periods in 2021 prior to conversion.
In August 2021, we resumed borrowing under our Commercial Paper Program to fund, in part, acquisition activities.
On December 16, 2021, we entered into a term loan credit agreement, which provides for a 364-day delayed-draw term loan facility up to an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion. Borrowings under the Delayed-Draw Term Loan facility may be Base Rate Loans, Daily Floating London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans and bear interest as follows: (1) Eurodollar Rate Loans bear interest at a variable rate equal to the London inter-bank offered rate plus a margin of between 60.0 and 80.0 basis points, depending on the Company’s long-term debt credit rating; (2) Daily Floating LIBOR Rate Loans, like Eurodollar Rate Loans, bear interest at a variable rate equal to the London inter-bank offered rate plus a margin of between 60.0 and 80.0 basis points, depending on the Company’s long-term debt credit rating; and (3) Base Rate Loans bear interest at a variable rate equal to the highest of (a) the Federal funds rate (as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from time to time) plus 1/2 of 1%, (b) Bank of America’s prime rate as publicly announced from time to time and (c) the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus 1%; provided that in no event will the Eurodollar Rate be less than 0.0%.
We immediately drew down the full $1.0 billion available under the facility as a daily floating LIBOR rate loan (“Delayed-Draw Term Loan”) with repayment of the principal due December 15, 2022. The Delayed-Draw Term Loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to the daily LIBOR rate plus a spread of 60 basis points, based on Fortive’s current credit rating. Borrowings under the Delayed-Draw Term Loan facility are prepayable at the Company’s option in whole or in part without premium or penalty and amounts borrowed may not be reborrowed once repaid.
Subsequent Event
On February 15, 2022, the maturity date of the Convertible Notes, Fortive repaid, in cash, $1.2 billion in outstanding principal and accrued interest thereon.
2020 Financing and Capital Transactions
In prior periods, we generally satisfied any short-term liquidity needs that are not met through operating cash flows and available cash through issuances of commercial paper under our U.S. dollar and Euro-denominated commercial paper programs (“Commercial Paper Programs”). Due to the volatility and disruption in the commercial paper markets during the first six months of 2020, we temporarily reduced our reliance on this source of funding, and consequently paid down and refinanced our outstanding commercial paper with the Term Loan Due March 2021. Credit support for the Commercial Paper Programs is provided by a five-year $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on November 30, 2023 (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) which, to the extent not otherwise providing credit support for the commercial paper programs, can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2021, no borrowings were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.
On April 24, 2020, we amended (the “Amendments”) the credit agreement for each of our (i) $500 million delayed draw term loan facility, which has been repaid as of December 31, 2020 (“2020 Term Loan”), (ii) Term Loan Due May 2021, with $1.0 billion in principal amount outstanding as of December 31, 2020, (iii) Term Loan due March 2021, with $400 million in principal amount outstanding as of December 31, 2020, and (iv) $2.0 billion Revolving Credit Facility, with no borrowings thereunder as of December 31, 2020 as follows:
•For any four fiscal quarters ending in the periods noted below (each an “Adjusted Four Quarters”) that end prior to the maturity date of the applicable facility, the maximum permitted consolidated net leverage ratio of consolidated net funded indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA was increased from 3.50 to 1.00 to, (i) with respect to the four fiscal quarters ending June 26, 2020, September 25, 2020, December 31, 2020, or April 2, 2021, 4.75 to 1.00, (ii) with respect to the four fiscal quarters ending July 2, 2021, 4.5 to 1.0, (iii) with respect to the four fiscal quarters ending October 1, 2021, 4.25 to 1.0 and (iv) with respect to the four fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2021, 3.75 to 1.0; provided however, that for any four fiscal quarters that are not an Adjusted Four Quarters, the maximum permitted consolidated net leverage ratio remains at 3.5 to 1.0, as may be increased to 4.0 to 1.0 following a material acquisition (the “Unadjusted Maximum Ratio”).
•The maturity date for the Term Loan Due May 2021 was extended from August 28, 2020 to May 30, 2021.
•From April 24, 2020 to December 31, 2021, the minimum London inter-bank offered rate (“LIBOR”) for each of the facilities will increase from 0% to 0.25%, and the minimum base rate for each of the facilities will increase from 1.00% to 1.25%. In addition, with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility and for any Adjusted Four Quarters in which the consolidated net leverage ratio is greater than the Unadjusted Maximum Ratio, the applicable margin (as determined based on our long-term debt credit rating) for any LIBOR rate loans will increase from a range of 80.5 and 117.5 basis points to a range of 118.0 and 155.0 basis points and for any base rate loans from a range of 0.0 and 17.5 basis points to a range of 18.0 and 55.0 basis points. Furthermore, with respect to the Term Loan Due May 2021, the applicable margin (as determined based on our long-term debt credit rating) for any LIBOR rate loans will increase
from a range of 75.0 and 97.5 basis points to a range of 155.0 and 180.0 basis points and for any base rate loans from 0.0 to a range of 55.0 and 80.0 basis points.
•From April 24, 2020 to December 31, 2021, the maximum principal amount of secured indebtedness, other than certain types of secured indebtedness expressly permitted under each credit agreement, is decreased from 15% of our consolidated net assets (when added together with indebtedness incurred or guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries) to 11.25% of our consolidated net assets (when added together with indebtedness incurred or guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries).
In connection with the Amendments, we incurred approximately $6.5 million of fees. Our credit facility agreements require, among others, that we maintain certain financial covenants and we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants on December 31, 2021.
During 2020, we completed the following financing and capital transactions:
•On February 25, 2020, we extended the maturity of the Term Loan Due May 2021 to August 28, 2020. Additionally, on April 24, 2020 we further extended the maturity to May 30, 2021. We were in compliance with our covenants both before and after the extension. The Term Loan due May 2021 was not callable and remained prepayable at our option.
•On February 26, 2020, we prepaid $250 million and on October 9, 2020, we repaid the remaining $250 million of the 2020 Term Loan. The fees associated with both prepayments were immaterial.
•On March 23, 2020, we entered into a credit facility agreement that provided for the Term Loan due March 2021 in an aggregate principal amount of $425 million. On the same day, we drew down $375 million available under the Term Loan due March 2021. We subsequently increased the size of this facility by $325 million on April 3, 2020, and drew the additional $375 million in April 2020, resulting in an outstanding amount of $750 million. We paid approximately $2 million in debt issuance costs associated with the Term Loan Due March 2021. The borrowings from this credit facility were used for settlement of outstanding commercial paper. Term Loan due March 2021 bore interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus a ratings-based margin currently at 155 basis points. As of December 31, 2020 borrowings under this facility bore an interest rate of 1.80% per annum. The Term Loan due March 2021 was due on March 19, 2021 and prepayable at our option. We are not permitted to re-borrow once the term loan is repaid. The terms and conditions, including covenants, applicable to the Term Loan due March 2021, are substantially similar to those applicable to our Revolving Credit Facility.
•On October 9, 2020, we repaid $350 million of the outstanding $750 million of the Term Loan due March 2021. The fees associated with the prepayment were immaterial.
•On October 15, 2020, we repaid the outstanding ¥13.8 billion balance of the Yen variable interest rate term loan due 2022 which approximated $131 million.
•On November 13, 2020, we redeemed for cash all $750 million aggregate principal of our outstanding 2.35% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “Notes”) in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the Notes. In connection with the transaction, we wrote-off the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs of $0.7 million and recorded a loss on extinguishment of $8 million.
2019 Financing and Capital Transactions
During 2019, we completed the following financing and capital transactions:
•On February 22, 2019, we issued $1.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of our Convertible Notes, including $187.5 million in aggregate principal amount resulting from an exercise in full of an over-allotment option. The Convertible Notes were sold in a private placement to certain initial purchasers for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933.
The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.875% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2019. The Convertible Notes mature on February 15, 2022, unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. As a result of the Separation and in accordance with the anti-dilution provisions of the Convertible Notes, effective October 9, 2020, the Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an adjusted conversion rate of 10.9568 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $91.27 per share), subject to future adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. Upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, holders will receive cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof, at Fortive’s election. Our current intention is to settle such conversions through cash up to the principal amount of the converted Convertible Notes and, if applicable, through shares of our common stock for conversion value, if any, in excess of the principal amount of the converted Convertible Notes.
Of the $1.4 billion in proceeds received from the issuance of the Convertible Notes, $1.3 billion was classified as debt and $102.2 million was classified as equity, using an assumed effective interest rate of 3.38%. Debt issuance costs of $24.3 million were proportionately allocated to debt and equity. The discount at issuance was $102.2 million and is being amortized over a three-year period.
•On February 28, 2019, we prepaid the remaining $400.0 million outstanding principal and accrued interest under the Delayed-Draw Term Loan due 2019. The prepayment fees associated with this payment were immaterial.
•On March 1, 2019, we entered into a credit facility agreement that provides for a 364-day delayed-draw term loan facility (“Term Loan due May 2021”) in an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion. On March 20, 2019, we drew down the full $1.0 billion available under the Term Loan due May 2021 in order to fund, in part, the ASP acquisition. The original maturity date of the Term Loan due May 2021 was February 28, 2020; however on February 25, 2020, we extended the maturity date to August 28, 2020. The Term Loan due May 2021 was prepayable at our option. We are not permitted to re-borrow once the term loan is repaid. The terms and conditions, including covenants, applicable to the Term Loan due May 2021 are substantially similar to those applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility.
•On June 15, 2019 we repaid the remaining outstanding principal of $55.3 million of our 1.80% senior unsecured notes.
•On October 25, 2019, we entered into a credit facility agreement that provides for a 364-day term loan facility (“2020 Term Loan”) in an aggregate principal amount of $300 million. On October 25, 2019, we drew down the full $300 million available under the 2020 Term Loan in order to fund, in part, the Censis acquisition. We subsequently increased the size of this facility by $200 million on November 8, 2019 and drew the additional amount on the same day resulting in an outstanding amount of $500 million. The 2020 Term Loan was due on October 23, 2020 and prepayable at our option. On February 26, 2020, we prepaid $250 million of the 2020 Term Loan and on October 9, 2020, we repaid the remaining $250 million of the 2020 Term Loan. The fees associated with both prepayments were immaterial. We are not permitted to re-borrow once the term loan is repaid. The terms and conditions, including covenants, applicable to the 2020 Term Loan are substantially similar to those applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility.
Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity
Following is an overview of our cash flows and liquidity:
Operating Activities
Operating cash flows from continuing operations can fluctuate significantly from period-to-period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, pension funding, and other items impact reported cash flows.
Operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $993 million in 2021, an increase of $15 million, or approximately 2%, as compared to 2020. This year-over-year change in operating cash flows from continuing operations was primarily attributable to the following factors:
•2021 operating cash flows were impacted by lower net earnings from continuing operations as compared to 2020, which were driven by a year-over-year increase in operating profits of $273 million, a decrease in interest expense of $45 million associated with the net repayment of debt, a gain on the Retained Vontier Shares of $57 million and a gain on litigation resolution of $30 million, which were partially offset by the loss on extinguishment of debt of $105 million. The gain on the Retained Vontier Shares and litigation dismissal, and substantially all of the loss on the extinguishment of debt, are noncash items that impact net earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows.
•The aggregate of accounts receivable, inventories, and trade accounts payable used $64 million of cash during 2021 compared to providing $93 million of cash during 2020. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of accounts receivable, inventories, and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively we manage the cash conversion cycle, which generally represents the number of days that elapse from the day we pay for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from our customers, and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period. During 2021 we experienced an increase in inventory due, in part, to higher safety stock levels, which were increased to buffer the impact of supply chain and logistics challenges and to fulfill customer demand.
•The aggregate of prepaid expenses and other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities used $6 million of cash in 2021 as compared to providing $208 million in 2020 with year-over-year change largely driven by the funding of a $28 million deferred compensation liability, which was associated with the ServiceChannel acquisition and was paid into escrow upon closing of the transaction, as well as other routine changes in various compensation and benefit payments.
Operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $978 million in 2020, an increase of $276 million, or approximately 39%, as compared to 2019. This year-over-year change in operating cash flows from continuing operations was primarily attributable to the following factors:
•2020 operating cash flows were impacted by higher net earnings from continuing operations as compared to 2019, which were driven by a year-over-year increase in operating profits of $96 million and a year-over-year increase in interest expense of $6 million primarily associated with our financing activities. The year-over-year increase in operating profit was partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses of $43 million largely attributable to our recently acquired businesses. Further, the year-over-year increase in net earnings for 2020 was impacted by the recognition of a $1.1 billion unrealized gain on the Retained Vontier Shares. Depreciation, amortization, and the unrealized gain are noncash expenses that impact earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows.
•The aggregate of accounts receivable, inventories, and trade accounts payable provided $93 million of operating cash flows during 2020 compared to using $59 million of cash during 2019. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of accounts receivable, inventories, and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively we manage the cash conversion cycle, which effectively represents the number of days that elapse from the day we pay for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from our customers, and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period.
•The aggregate of prepaid expenses and other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities provided $208 million of cash in 2020 as compared to providing $148 million in 2019. The year over year change was largely driven by the timing of tax payments and various employee benefit accruals.
Investing Activities
Investing cash flows from continuing operations consist primarily of cash paid for acquisitions and capital expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was approximately $2.6 billion during 2021 compared to approximately $0.1 billion and $4.0 billion of net cash used in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in investing cash flows was driven by the acquisitions of ServiceChannel and Provation, which totaled approximately $2.6 billion, partially offset by a year-over-year decrease in capital expenditures of $26 million. The reduction in capital expenditures was largely due to higher spending in the comparable period in 2020, which was related to the integration of the ASP business. For a discussion of our acquisitions refer to “-Overview.”
Capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting product development initiatives, improving information technology systems, and purchasing equipment that is used in revenue arrangements with customers. Capital expenditures totaled $50 million in 2021, $76 million in 2020, and $75 million in 2019. We expect capital
spending to be between approximately $80 million and $100 million in 2022, though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions.
Financing Activities and Indebtedness
Financing cash flows from continuing operations consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance of equity, the issuance and repayments of debt and commercial paper, payments of quarterly cash dividends to common and preferred shareholders, and cash consideration received from the Vontier Separation. Financing activities from continuing operations generated cash of $652 million in 2021 compared to using $676 million and generating $2.8 billion of cash in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2021, we repaid the remaining $317 million outstanding on the Delayed-Draw Term Loan Due 2020, repurchased $281 million of the 0.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022, and resumed borrowing under our Commercial Paper Programs, with proceeds being used for acquisitions and general corporate purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid $132 million of cash dividends to common shareholders and holders of our MCPS.
Refer to “-Liquidity and Capital Resources” section above for a description of our financing activities in 2021, 2020, and 2019.
We generally expect to satisfy any short-term liquidity needs that are not met through operating cash flows and available cash primarily through term loans or issuances of commercial paper under the Commercial Paper Programs, with credit support provided by the Revolving Credit Facility.
The carrying value of total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2021 was approximately $4.0 billion. We had $2.0 billion available under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our financing activities and indebtedness.
The availability of the Revolving Credit Facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of the Commercial Paper Programs when we have outstanding borrowings. As of December 31, 2021, we had $0.4 million borrowings outstanding under our Commercial Paper Program. We expect to limit any future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility to amounts that would leave sufficient credit available under the facility to allow us to borrow, if needed, to repay any outstanding commercial paper as it matures.
In 2020, we repaid $1.1 billion related to the issuance of commercial paper under the Commercial Paper Program, received proceeds from borrowings of $742 million, repaid $1.7 billion of borrowings, and paid $163 million of cash dividends to shareholders.
Subsequent Event
On February 17, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 20 million shares of the Company's outstanding common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. There is no expiration date for the repurchase program, and the timing and amount of repurchases under the program are determined by the Company's management based on market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time by the Board of Directors.
Dividends
On November 4, 2021, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.07 per common share paid on December 30, 2021 to holders of record on November 26, 2021.
Aggregate cash payments for both common and MCPS dividends paid to shareholders during the year ended December 31, 2021 were $132 million and were recorded as dividends to shareholders in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
On January 25, 2022, we declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share payable on March 25, 2022 to common stockholders of record on February 25, 2022.
Cash and Cash Requirements
Cash
As of December 31, 2021, we held approximately $819.3 million of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment-grade instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less. The annual effective rate was immaterial. Approximately 18% of our cash at December 31, 2021 was held in the U.S.
We have cash requirements to support working capital needs, capital expenditures and acquisitions, pay interest and service debt, pay taxes and any related interest or penalties, fund our pension plans as required, pay dividends to shareholders, and support other business needs or objectives. With respect to our cash requirements, we generally intend to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements, but in the event that additional liquidity is required, particularly in connection with acquisitions, we may also borrow under our commercial paper programs or credit facilities or enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under our commercial paper programs. We also may from time to time access the capital markets, including to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions.
We have made an assertion regarding the amount of current earnings that we do not intend to repatriate due to local working capital needs, local law restrictions, high foreign remittance costs, previous investments in physical assets and acquisitions, or future growth needs. For most of our foreign operations, we make an assertion regarding the amount of earnings in excess of intended repatriation that are expected to be held for indefinite reinvestment. The amount of foreign remittance taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given local law restrictions that may apply to a portion of such earnings, unknown changes in foreign tax law that may occur during the applicable restriction periods caused by applicable local corporate law for cash repatriation, and the various tax planning alternatives we could employ if we repatriated these earnings.
Cash Requirements
The following table sets forth a summary of our short-term and long-term cash requirements as of December 31, 2021 under (1) long-term debt principal and interest obligations, (2) leases, (3) purchase obligations and (4) other long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under GAAP. Certain of our acquisitions may involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table below does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts of any such payments are uncertain.
In addition to the obligations noted above, we have issued guarantees, consisting primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit, bank guarantees, and performance and bid bonds, in connection with certain arrangements with vendors, customers, financing counterparties, and governmental entities to secure our obligations and/or performance requirements related to specific transactions. These guarantees are not recorded on our balance sheet and $37 million in commitments expire within one year of December 31, 2021 and $27 million later than one year from December 31, 2021.
During 2021, we contributed $1 million and $10 million to our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, respectively. During 2022, our cash contribution requirements for our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately $2 million and $12 million, respectively. The ultimate amounts we will contribute depend upon, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plan’s funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution, local practices, market conditions, interest rates, and other factors.
As of December 31, 2021 we expect to have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future, including our cash needs in the United States.
Legal Proceedings
Please refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies, and for a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and judgments on historical experience, the current economic environment, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments.
We believe the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of our financial statements. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and (2) material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period to period. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates, refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
Accounts Receivable: We measure our allowance to reflect expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the asset in accordance with ASU No. 2016-13 Financial Instruments- Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. We pool assets with similar risk characteristics for this measurement based on attributes that may include asset type, duration, and/or credit risk rating. The future expected losses of each pool are estimated based on numerous quantitative and qualitative factors reflecting management’s estimate of collectability over the remaining contractual life of the pooled assets, including:
•duration;
•historical, current, and forecasted future loss experience by asset type;
•historical, current, and forecasted delinquency and write-off trends;
•historical, current, and forecasted economic conditions; and
•historical, current, and forecasted credit risk.
We regularly perform detailed reviews of our trade accounts and unbilled receivable portfolios to determine if changes in the aforementioned qualitative and quantitative factors have impacted the adequacy of the allowances.
Volatility and uncertainty in overall global economic conditions and worldwide capital markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact our customers’ ability to pay and, as a result, may increase the difficulty in collecting trade accounts and unbilled receivables. We did not realize notable increases in loss rates and delinquencies during the year ended December 31, 2021, and given the nature of our portfolio of receivables, our historical experience during times of challenging economic conditions, and our forecasted future impact of COVID-19 on our customer’s ability to pay, we did not record material provisions for credit losses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic during the year ended December 31, 2021. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our current estimates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, we would be required to write-off additional receivable balances, which would adversely impact our net earnings and financial condition. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimates used in the calculation of our allowance, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease in anticipated collectability, noting that our allowance would increase by $4 million with a corresponding charge to SG&A.
Expected credit losses of the assets originated during the year ended December 31, 2021, as well as changes to expected losses during the same periods, are recognized in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Inventories: We record inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. We estimate the net realizable value of our inventory based on assumptions of future demand and related pricing. Estimating the net realizable value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand, technological advances, and pricing competition in many of our markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond our control. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected, we could be required to reduce the value of our inventory, which would adversely impact our financial statements. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimates used in the calculation of the net realizable value of our inventory, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the anticipated realization, noting that our inventory would decrease by $7 million with a corresponding charge to Cost of goods sold. Refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for detailed information regarding our inventory balances as of December 31, 2021.
Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill: Our business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill, in-process R&D, and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that we may incur. Refer to Notes 2, 3 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our policies relating to goodwill, acquired intangibles, and acquisitions.
In performing our goodwill impairment testing, we estimate the fair value of our reporting units primarily using a market based approach. We estimate fair value based on multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of our reporting units, in addition to recent market available sale transactions of comparable businesses. In evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach, we make judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to our reporting units, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected. In certain circumstances we also evaluate other factors including results of the estimated fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis (i.e., an income approach), market positions of the businesses, comparability of market sales transactions, and financial and operating performance in order to validate the results of the market approach. The discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth, future operating margins, discount rates, and terminal values. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.
In 2021, we had five reporting units for goodwill impairment testing in continuing operations. Reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment. We believe the impairment risk associated with these reporting units generally decreases as we integrate these businesses and better position them for potential future earnings growth. As of the date of the 2021 annual impairment test, the carrying value of goodwill in each reporting unit ranged from $171.3 million to $3.3 billion. Our annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2021 indicated that, in all instances, the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge.
The excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of our reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 115% to approximately 785%. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values. Based on this hypothetical 10% decrease, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of our reporting units ranged from approximately 90% to approximately 705%. We evaluated other factors relating to the fair value of the reporting units, including, as applicable, results of the estimated fair value using an income approach, market positions of the businesses, comparability of market sales transactions and financial and operating performance, and concluded no impairment charges were required.
We review identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. We also test intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment. These analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues, expenses, market conditions, and discount rates related to these assets.
If actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect our financial statements.
Contingent Liabilities: As discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, we are, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). We recognize a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of
negotiations, the number of future claims, and the cost of both pending and future claims. In addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to various factors, including those discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. If the reserves we established with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, we would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect our financial statements.
Revenue Recognition: We derive revenue from the sale of products and services. Revenue is recognized when control over the promised products or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In determining if control has transferred, we consider whether certain indicators of the transfer of control are present, such as the transfer of title, present right to payment, significant risks and rewards of ownership, and customer acceptance when acceptance is not a formality. To determine the consideration that the customer owes us, we make judgments regarding the amount of customer allowances and rebates, consisting primarily of volume discounts and other short-term incentive programs. Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our revenue recognition policies.
If our judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect, our reported revenues in particular periods may be adversely affected. Historically, our estimates of revenue have been materially correct.
Stock-Based Compensation: For a description of our stock-based compensation accounting practices, refer to Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of certain stock-based payment awards require subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the awards, stock price volatility, and expected forfeiture rate. Given our limited trading history following the separation from Danaher, stock price volatility used to calculate the fair value of stock options in the post-separation period was estimated based on an average historical stock price volatility of a group of peer companies. Expected volatility is based on a weighted average blend of our historical stock price volatility from July 2, 2016 (the date of the Danaher separation) through the stock option grant date and the average historical stock price volatility of a group of peer companies for the expected term of the options. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, our equity-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.
Pension and Other Post Employment Benefits: For a description of our pension accounting practices, refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Certain of our U.S. and non-U.S. employees participate in noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. Calculations of the amount of pension costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations, including assumptions regarding discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rates of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and other factors. If the assumptions used in calculating pension and other post-retirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change (as a result of differences in actual experience, changes in key economic indicators, or other factors), our financial statements could be materially affected. A 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans during 2021 would have increased the net obligation by $30 million from the amounts recorded in the financial statements as of December 31, 2021.
Our plan assets consist of various insurance contracts, equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan. The estimated long-term rate of return for the plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 1.25% to 4.32%. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets during 2021 was reduced by 50 basis points, pension expense in 2021 would have increased by $1 million ($1 million on an after-tax basis).
Income Taxes: For a description of our income tax accounting policies, refer to Note 2 and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
In accordance with GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which the tax benefit has already been reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent items that have already been taken as a deduction on our tax return but have not yet been recognized as an expense in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date.
Our deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We evaluate the realizability of deferred income tax assets for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. If we experience cumulative pretax income in a particular jurisdiction in the three-year period including the current and prior two years, we normally conclude that the deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realizable and no valuation allowance is recognized,
unless known or planned operating developments would lead management to conclude otherwise. However, if we experience cumulative pretax losses in a particular jurisdiction in the three-year period including the current and prior two years, we then consider a series of factors in the determination of whether the deferred income tax assets can be realized. These factors include historical operating results, known or planned operating developments, the period of time over which certain temporary differences will reverse, consideration of the utilization of certain deferred income tax liabilities, tax law carryback capability in the particular country, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. After evaluation of these factors, if the deferred income tax assets are expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period allowed for that specific country, we would conclude that no valuation allowance would be required. To the extent that the deferred income tax assets exceed the amount that is expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period for a particular jurisdiction, we establish a valuation allowance.
We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if, in our assessment, it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions. We re-evaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances, including when: (i) a tax audit is completed; (ii) applicable tax laws change, including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance; or (iii) the applicable statute of limitations expires. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties with unrecognized tax positions in income tax expense.
In addition, we are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audit by federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments (see “-Results of Operations - Income Taxes” and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements). We review our global tax positions on a quarterly basis. Based on these reviews, the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities, tax rulings, and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary.
An increase in our 2021 effective tax rate of 1.0% would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 of $7 million.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
For a discussion of new accounting standards relevant to our businesses, refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
