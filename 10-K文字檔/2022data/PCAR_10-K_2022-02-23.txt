Truck Outlook
Heavy-duty truck industry retail sales in the U.S. and Canada in 2022 are expected to be 250,000 to 290,000 units compared to 250,000 in 2021. In Europe, the 2022 truck industry registrations for over 16-tonne vehicles are expected to be 260,000 to 300,000 units compared to 278,000 in 2021. In South America, heavy-duty truck industry registrations in 2022 are projected to be 125,000 to 135,000 compared to 127,000 in 2021.
The Company has been affected by an industry-wide undersupply of semiconductor chips and anticipates the shortage will continue to affect deliveries in 2022.
Parts Outlook
In 2022, PACCAR Parts sales are expected to increase 6-9% compared to 2021 levels reflecting strong freight demand. If economic conditions were to worsen, lower freight volumes could reduce the demand for replacement parts, resulting in lower parts revenues and operating results.
Financial Services Outlook
In 2022, average earning assets are expected to be similar to 2021. Current high levels of freight tonnage, freight rates and fleet utilization are contributing to customers’ profitability and cash flow. If current freight transportation conditions decline due to weaker economic conditions, then past due accounts, truck repossessions and credit losses would likely increase from the current low levels and new business volume would likely decline.
Capital Spending and R&D Outlook
Capital investments in 2022 are expected to be $425 to $475 million, and R&D is expected to be $350 to $400 million. The Company is increasing its investment in clean diesel and zero emissions powertrain technologies, autonomous systems, connected vehicle services, next-generation manufacturing and distribution capabilities.
See the Forward-Looking Statements section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis for factors that may affect these outlooks.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS:
The Company’s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are presented below. For information on the year ended December 31, 2019, refer to Part II, Item 7 in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The following provides an analysis of the results of operations for the Company’s three reportable segments - Truck, Parts and Financial Services. Where possible, the Company has quantified the impact of factors identified in the following discussion and analysis. In cases where it is not possible to quantify the impact of factors, the Company lists them in estimated order of importance. Factors for which the Company is unable to specifically quantify the impact include market demand, fuel prices, freight tonnage, economic conditions and COVID-19 related factors affecting the Company’s results of operations.
2021 Compared to 2020:
Truck
The Company’s Truck segment accounted for 71% of revenues in 2021 compared to 70% in 2020.
The Company’s new truck deliveries are summarized below:
The increase in new truck deliveries worldwide in 2021 compared to 2020 was driven primarily by higher build rates and increased demand in all markets.
Market share data discussed below is provided by third-party sources and is measured by either registrations or retail sales for the
Company’s dealer network as a percentage of total registrations or retail sales depending on the geographic market. In the U.S. and
Canada, market share is based on retail sales. In Europe, market share is based primarily on registrations.
In 2021, industry retail sales in the heavy-duty market in the U.S. and Canada increased to 249,900 units from 216,500 units in 2020. The Company’s heavy-duty truck retail market share was 29.2% in 2021 compared to 30.1% in 2020. The medium-duty market was 83,700 units in 2021 compared to 74,400 units in 2020. The Company’s medium-duty market share was 19.8% in 2021 compared to 22.6% in 2020.
The over 16-tonne truck market in Europe in 2021 increased to 278,000 units from 230,400 units in 2020, and DAF’s market share was 15.9% in 2021 compared to 16.3% in 2020. The 6 to 16-tonne market was 41,400 units in 2021 and 2020. DAF’s market share in the 6 to 16-tonne market in 2021 was 10.1% compared to 9.5% in 2020.
The Company’s worldwide truck net sales and revenues are summarized below:
The Company’s worldwide truck net sales and revenues increased to $16.80 billion in 2021 from $13.16 billion in 2020 due to higher truck deliveries in all markets. Truck segment income before income taxes and pretax return on revenues reflect higher truck unit deliveries, primarily due to increased demand in all markets. In both 2021 and 2020, Truck segment income before taxes and pretax return on revenues reflect the tempering of truck unit deliveries due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, truck deliveries and margins were impacted by the global semiconductor supply shortage.
The major factors for the Truck segment changes in net sales and revenues, cost of sales and revenues and gross margin between 2021 and 2020 are as follows:
•
Truck sales volume reflects higher unit deliveries in all markets, primarily in the U.S. and Canada ($1.43 billion sales and $1.19 billion cost of sales), and Europe ($884.5 million sales and $750.8 million cost of sales) due to increased demand.
•
Average truck sales prices increased sales by $457.0 million, primarily due to higher price realization in all major markets.
•
Average cost per truck increased cost of sales by $448.7 million, primarily reflecting higher raw material costs, partially offset by lower product support costs.
•
Factory overhead and other indirect costs increased $226.0 million, primarily due to higher labor costs, and higher supplies and maintenance costs to support increased truck production.
•
Extended warranties, operating leases and other revenues increased by $95.6 million primarily due to higher revenues from service contracts and extended warranty contracts. Cost of sales and revenues increased by $30.5 million primarily due to higher costs from service contracts and extended warranty contracts, largely offset by gains on sales of used trucks and lower impairments in Europe due to an improved used truck market.
•
The currency translation effect on sales and cost of sales primarily reflects an increase in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar.
•
Truck gross margins increased to 7.8% in 2021 from 7.5% in 2020, primarily due to the factors noted above.
Truck selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) for 2021 increased to $267.9 million from $210.9 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses and higher professional expenses. As a percentage of sales, Truck SG&A was 1.6% for 2021 and 2020.
Parts
The Company’s Parts segment accounted for 21% of revenues in 2021 and 2020.
The worldwide parts net sales and revenues increased to a record $4.94 billion in 2021 from $3.91 billion in 2020 primarily due to higher demand in all markets and favorable currency translation effects. The increase in Parts segment income before income taxes and pre-tax return on revenues was primarily due to higher sales volume and higher margins, as well as favorable currency translation effects.
The major factors for the Parts segment changes in net sales and revenues, cost of sales and revenues and gross margin between 2021 and 2020 are as follows:
•
Aftermarket parts sales volume increased by $720.8 million and related cost of sales increased by $481.8 million primarily due to higher demand in all markets.
•
Average aftermarket parts sales prices increased sales by $239.7 million primarily due to higher price realization in North America and Europe.
•
Average aftermarket parts direct costs increased $137.6 million due to higher material costs.
•
Warehouse and other indirect costs increased $33.9 million, primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses and higher shipping costs due to increased volumes and rates.
•
The currency translation effect on sales and cost of sales primarily reflects an increase in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar.
•
Parts gross margins in 2021 increased to 28.5% from 27.3% in 2020 due to the factors noted above.
Parts SG&A expense for 2021 increased to $210.3 million compared to $192.7 million in 2020 primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses and currency translation effects, partially offset by lower sales and marketing costs. As a percentage of sales, Parts SG&A decreased to 4.3% in 2021 from 4.9% in 2020, primarily due to higher net sales.
Financial Services
The Company’s Financial Services segment accounted for 7% of revenues in 2021 compared to 8% in 2020.
New loan and lease volume increased to a record $5.67 billion in 2021 from $5.02 billion in 2020, primarily reflecting higher truck deliveries worldwide. PFS finance market share of new PACCAR truck sales was 26.6% in 2021 compared to 28.4% in 2020.
PFS revenues increased to $1.69 billion in 2021 from $1.57 billion in 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher used truck sales in Europe and North America. The effects of currency translation increased PFS revenues by $41.2 million in 2021, primarily due to a stronger euro and Mexican peso relative to the U.S. dollar.
PFS income before income taxes increased to a record $437.6 million in 2021 from $223.1 million in 2020, primarily due to improved used truck results and a lower provision for credit losses. The effect of currency translation increased 2021 PFS income before income taxes by $8.8 million.
Included in Financial Services “Other Assets” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets are used trucks held for sale, net of impairments, of $92.1 million at December 31, 2021 and $375.8 million at December 31, 2020. These trucks are primarily units returned from matured operating leases in the ordinary course of business, and also include trucks acquired from repossessions, through acquisitions of used trucks in trades related to new truck sales and trucks returned from residual value guarantees (RVGs).
The Company recognized gains on used trucks, excluding repossessions, of $30.3 million in 2021 compared to losses of $88.2 million in 2020, including losses on multiple unit transactions of $17.7 million in 2021 compared to $38.6 million in 2020. Used truck gains in 2021 and losses in 2020 related to repossessions, which are recognized as credit losses, were insignificant.
The major factors for the changes in interest and fees, interest and other borrowing expenses and finance margin between 2021 and 2020 are outlined below:
•
Average debt balances decreased $439.9 million (excluding foreign exchange effects) in 2021, reflecting lower funding requirements for the portfolio which includes loans, finance leases, dealer wholesale and equipment on operating lease.
•
Lower portfolio yields (4.6% in 2021 compared to 4.7% in 2020) decreased interest and fees by $14.6 million. The lower portfolio yields were primarily due to lower market rates in North America.
•
Lower borrowing rates (1.4% in 2021 compared to 1.8% in 2020) were primarily due to lower debt market rates in the U.S.
•
Currency translation and other primarily reflects an increase in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.
The following table summarizes operating lease, rental and other revenues and depreciation and other expenses:
The major factors for the changes in operating lease, rental and other revenues, depreciation and other expenses and lease margin between 2021 and 2020 are outlined below:
•
Higher market prices and a higher sales volume of used trucks received on trade and upon RVG contract expiration increased operating lease, rental and other revenues by $81.4 million. Higher lease portfolio unit sales volume increased depreciation and other expenses by $72.5 million.
•
Results on returned lease assets decreased depreciation and other expenses by $107.4 million primarily due to gains on sales on returned lease units in 2021 compared to losses in 2020 and lower impairments in Europe and the U.S. as a result of higher used truck market values.
•
Average operating lease assets decreased $84.9 million (excluding foreign exchange effects), which decreased revenues by $14.7 million and related depreciation and other expenses by $11.5 million.
•
Revenue per asset increased $20.5 million primarily due to higher rental utilization. Cost per asset decreased $19.7 million due to lower operating lease impairment in Europe and lower depreciation expense.
•
The currency translation effects reflect an increase in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro.
Financial Services SG&A expense increased to $129.4 million in 2021 from $122.2 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses. As a percentage of revenues, Financial Services SG&A decreased to 7.7% in 2021 from 7.8% in 2020.
The following table summarizes the provision (benefit) for losses on receivables and net charge-offs:
The provision for losses on receivables decreased to $.5 million in 2021 from $28.8 million in 2020, primarily reflecting strong portfolio performance in 2021, and 2020 included higher provisioning due to weakening economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic and a credit loss on a fleet customer in the U.S.
The Company modifies loans and finance leases as a normal part of its Financial Services operations. The Company may modify loans and finance leases for commercial reasons or for credit reasons. Modifications for commercial reasons are changes to contract terms for customers that are not considered to be in financial difficulty. Insignificant delays are modifications extending terms up to three months for customers experiencing some short-term financial stress, but not considered to be in financial difficulty. Modifications for credit reasons are changes to contract terms for customers considered to be in financial difficulty. The Company’s modifications typically result in granting more time to pay the contractual amounts owed and charging a fee and interest for the term of the modification. When considering whether to modify customer accounts for credit reasons, the Company evaluates the creditworthiness of the customers and modifies those accounts that the Company considers likely to perform under the modified terms. When the
Company modifies a loan or finance lease for credit reasons and grants a concession, the modification is classified as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR).
The post-modification balances of accounts modified during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are summarized below:
*
Amortized cost basis immediately after modification as a percentage of the year-end retail portfolio balance.
In 2021, total modification activity decreased compared to 2020. The increase in modifications for Commercial reasons primarily reflects higher volumes of refinancing. The decrease in modifications for Insignificant delay reflects fleet customers requesting payment relief for up to three months related to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The decrease in modifications for Credit - no concession is primarily due to lower volumes of refinancing and requests for payment relief in Mexico and Europe. The decrease in modifications for Credit - TDR is primarily due to 2020 contract modifications of two fleet customers in the U.S. and four fleet customers in Mexico.
The following table summarizes the Company’s 30+ days past due accounts:
Accounts 30+ days past due decreased to .3% at December 31, 2021 from .5% at December 31, 2020. The Company continues to focus on maintaining low past due balances.
When the Company modifies a 30+ days past due account, the customer is then generally considered current under the revised contractual terms. The Company modified $.4 million and $18.6 million of accounts worldwide during the fourth quarter of 2021 and the fourth quarter of 2020, respectively, which were 30+ days past due and became current at the time of modification. Had these accounts not been modified and continued to not make payments, the pro forma percentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+ days past due would have been as follows:
Modifications of accounts in prior quarters that were more than 30 days past due at the time of modification are included in past dues if they were not performing under the modified terms at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The effect on the allowance for credit losses from such modifications was not significant at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
The Company’s 2021 and 2020 annualized pre-tax return on average total assets for Financial Services was 2.8% and 1.4%, respectively.
Other
Other includes the winch business as well as sales, income and expenses not attributable to a reportable segment. Other also includes non-service cost components of pension expense and a portion of corporate expense. Other sales represent less than 1% of consolidated net sales and revenues for 2021 and 2020. Other SG&A increased to $69.2 million in 2021 from $55.6 million in 2020 primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses.
Other income before tax was $25.6 million in 2021 compared to $18.2 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to a higher benefit from non-service components of pension expense, partially offset by higher salaries and related expenses.
Investment income decreased to $15.5 million in 2021 from $35.9 million in 2020, primarily due to lower yields on U.S. investments due to lower market interest rates.
Income Taxes
In 2021, the effective tax rate was 22.1% compared to 21.7% in 2020. The higher effective tax rate in 2021 was primarily due to the change in mix of income generated in jurisdictions with higher tax rates in 2021 as compared to 2020.
In 2021, both domestic and foreign income before income taxes and pre-tax return on revenues increased primarily due to the improved results from Truck, Parts and Financial Services operations.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES:
The Company’s total cash and marketable securities at December 31, 2021 increased $19.1 million from the balances at December 31, 2020. Total cash and marketable securities are primarily intended to provide liquidity while preserving capital.
The change in cash and cash equivalents is summarized below:
Operating activities: Cash provided by operations decreased by $800.5 million to $2.19 billion in 2021 from $2.99 billion in 2020. Lower operating cash flows reflect lower cash receipts from wholesale receivables in the Financial Services segment of $780.4 million, higher cash usage of $562.1 million for inventories and lower cash receipts from accounts receivables of $534.7 million as there were fewer receipts in 2021 compared to collections exceeding sales in 2020. Additionally, lower operating cash flows reflect higher cash outflows for payment of income taxes of $387.1 million. This was partially offset by higher cash inflows of $747.0 million from accounts payable and accrued expenses as purchases of goods and services exceeded payments in 2021 compared to 2020 when payments exceeded purchases. Additionally, the lower operating cash flows were offset by higher net income of $553.7 million and lower pension contributions of $159.8 million compared to 2020.
Investing activities: Cash used in investing activities decreased by $513.1 million to $1.36 billion in 2021 from $1.88 billion in 2020. Lower net cash used in investing activities primarily reflects higher proceeds from asset disposals of $302.2 million and lower net originations from retail loans and financing leases of $208.0 million.
Financing activities: Cash used in financing activities decreased $925.6 million to $882.9 million in 2021 compared to $1,808.5 million in 2020. Cash used by borrowing activities in 2021 was $210.9 million, $369.4 million lower than the cash used by borrowing activities of $580.3 million in 2020. The Company repurchased .02 million shares of common stock for $1.5 million in 2021 compared to the repurchase of .7 million shares for $42.1 million in 2020. In addition, the Company paid $708.0 million in dividends in 2021 compared to $1,239.8 million in 2020 due to a lower extra dividend paid in January 2021.
The Company expects to continue paying dividends, although there is no assurance as to future dividends because they are dependent upon future earnings, capital requirements and financial conditions. Cash dividends declared for the last two years were as follows:
Credit Lines and Other:
The Company has line of credit arrangements of $3.60 billion, of which $3.32 billion were unused at December 31, 2021. Included in these arrangements are $3.00 billion of committed bank facilities, of which $1.00 billion expires in June 2022, $1.00 billion expires in June 2024 and $1.00 billion expires in June 2026. The Company intends to extend or replace these credit facilities on or before expiration to maintain facilities of similar amounts and duration. These credit facilities are maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for commercial paper borrowings and maturing medium-term notes. There were no borrowings under the committed bank facilities for the year ended December 31, 2021.
On December 4, 2018, PACCAR’s Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has repurchased $110.0 million of shares under this plan. There were no repurchases made under this plan during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Truck, Parts and Other
The Company provides funding for working capital, capital expenditures, R&D, dividends, stock repurchases and other business initiatives and commitments primarily from cash provided by operations. Management expects this method of funding to continue in the future.
Investments for manufacturing property, plant and equipment in 2021 were $495.6 million compared to $558.8 million in 2020. Over the past decade, the Company’s combined investments in worldwide capital projects and R&D totaled $7.21 billion and have significantly increased the operating capacity and efficiency of its facilities and enhanced the quality and operating efficiency of the Company’s premium products.
Capital investments in 2022 are expected to be $425 to $475 million, and R&D is expected to be $350 to $400 million. The Company is increasing its investment in clean diesel and zero emissions powertrain technologies, autonomous systems, connected vehicle services, next-generation manufacturing and distribution capabilities.
Financial Services
The Company funds its financial services activities primarily from collections on existing finance receivables and borrowings in the capital markets. The primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and medium-term notes issued in the public markets and, to a lesser extent, bank loans.
In November 2021, the Company’s U.S. finance subsidiary, PACCAR Financial Corp. (PFC), filed a shelf registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The total amount of medium-term notes outstanding for PFC as of December 31, 2021 was $5.50 billion. In February 2022, PFC issued $300.0 million of medium-term notes under this registration. The registration expires in November 2024 and does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued during that period.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s European finance subsidiary, PACCAR Financial Europe, had €1.60 billion available for issuance under a €2.50 billion medium-term note program listed on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. This program renews annually and expires in July 2022.
In August 2021, PACCAR Financial Mexico registered a 10.00 billion Mexican peso program with the Comision Nacional Bancaria y de Valores to issue medium-term notes and commercial paper. The registration expires in August 2026 and limits the amount of Commercial paper (up to one year) to 5.00 billion Mexican pesos. At December 31, 2021, 9.54 billion Mexican pesos were available for issuance.
In August 2018, the Company’s Australian subsidiary, PACCAR Financial Pty. Ltd. (PFPL), registered a medium-term note program. The program does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued under the program. The total amount of medium-term notes outstanding for PFPL as of December 31, 2021 was 700.0 million Australian dollars.
In May 2021, the Company’s Canadian subsidiary, PACCAR Financial Ltd. (PFL Canada), established a medium-term note program.
The program does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued under the program. The total amount of
medium-term notes outstanding for PFL Canada as of December 31, 2021 was 150.0 million Canadian dollars.
The Company believes its cash balances and investments, collections on existing finance receivables, committed bank facilities, and current investment-grade credit ratings of A+/A1 will continue to provide it with sufficient resources and access to capital markets at competitive interest rates and therefore contribute to the Company maintaining its liquidity and financial stability. In the event of a decrease in the Company’s credit ratings or a disruption in the financial markets, the Company may not be able to refinance its maturing debt in the financial markets. In such circumstances, the Company would be exposed to liquidity risk to the degree that the timing of debt maturities differs from the timing of receivable collections from customers. The Company believes its various sources of liquidity, including committed bank facilities, would continue to provide it with sufficient funding resources to service its maturing debt obligations.
Commitments
The following summarizes the Company’s contractual cash commitments at December 31, 2021:
*
Commercial paper included in borrowings is at par value.
**
Interest on floating-rate debt is based on the applicable market rates at December 31, 2021.
Total cash commitments for borrowings and interest on term debt were $10.61 billion and were related to the Financial Services segment. As described in Note J of the consolidated financial statements, borrowings consist primarily of term notes and commercial paper issued by the Financial Services segment. The Company expects to fund its maturing Financial Services debt obligations principally from funds provided by collections from customers on loans and lease contracts, as well as from the proceeds of
commercial paper and medium-term note borrowings. Purchase obligations are the Company’s contractual commitments to acquire future production inventory and capital equipment. Other obligations primarily include commitments to purchase energy.
The Company’s other commitments include the following at December 31, 2021:
Loan and lease commitments are for funding new retail loan and lease contracts. Residual value guarantees represent the Company’s commitment to acquire trucks at a guaranteed value if the customer decides to return the truck at a specified date in the future.
IMPACT OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:
The Company, its competitors and industry in general are subject to various domestic and foreign requirements relating to the environment. The Company believes its policies, practices and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling, use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances have been in accordance with environmental laws and regulations in effect at the time such use and disposal occurred.
The Company is involved in various stages of investigations and cleanup actions in different countries related to environmental matters. In certain of these matters, the Company has been designated as a “potentially responsible party” by domestic and foreign environmental agencies. The Company has accrued the estimated costs to investigate and complete cleanup actions where it is probable that the Company will incur such costs in the future. Expenditures related to environmental activities in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $4.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively. While the timing and amount of the ultimate costs associated with future environmental cleanup cannot be determined, management expects that these matters will not have a significant effect on the Company’s consolidated cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
The Company’s significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note A of the consolidated financial statements. In the preparation of the Company’s financial statements, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented. The following are accounting policies which, in the opinion of management, are particularly sensitive and which, if actual results are different from estimates used by management, may have a material impact on the financial statements.
Operating Leases
Trucks sold pursuant to agreements accounted for as operating leases are disclosed in Note F of the consolidated financial statements. In determining its estimate of the residual value of such vehicles, the Company considers the length of the lease term, the truck model, the expected usage of the truck and anticipated market demand. Operating lease terms generally range from three to five years. The resulting residual values on operating leases generally range between 30% and 70% of the original equipment cost. If the sales price of a truck at the end of the term of the agreement differs from the Company’s estimated residual value, a gain or loss will result.
Future market conditions, changes in government regulations and other factors outside the Company’s control could impact the ultimate sales price of trucks returned under these contracts. Residual values are reviewed regularly and adjusted if market conditions warrant. A decrease in the estimated equipment residual values would increase annual depreciation expense over the remaining lease term.
During 2021, market values on equipment returning upon operating lease maturity were generally higher than the residual values on the equipment, resulting in a decrease in depreciation expense of $21.8 million.
At December 31, 2021, the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases in the Financial Services segment and residual value guarantee on trucks accounted for as operating leases in the Truck segment was $2.17 billion. A 10% decrease in used truck values worldwide, if expected to persist over the remaining maturities of the Company’s operating leases, would reduce residual value estimates and result in the Company recording additional depreciation expense of approximately $84.1 million in 2022, $53.1 in 2023, $55.0 in 2024, $16.7 in 2025 and $8.5 in 2026 and thereafter.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses related to the Company’s loans and finance leases is disclosed in Note E of the consolidated financial statements. The Company has developed a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses for its two portfolio segments, retail and wholesale. The retail segment consists of retail loans and finance leases, net of unearned interest. The wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing loans to dealers that are collateralized by trucks and other collateral. The wholesale segment generally has less risk than the retail segment. Wholesale receivables generally are shorter in duration than retail receivables, and the Company requires periodic reporting of the wholesale dealer’s financial condition, conducts periodic audits of the trucks being financed and in many cases obtains guarantees or other security such as dealership assets. In determining the allowance for credit losses, retail loans and finance leases are evaluated together since they relate to a similar customer base, their contractual terms require regular payment of principal and interest, generally over three to five years, and they are secured by the same type of collateral. The allowance for credit losses consists of both specific and general reserves.
The Company individually evaluates certain finance receivables for impairment. Finance receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment consist of all wholesale accounts and certain large retail accounts with past due balances or otherwise determined to be at a higher risk of loss. A finance receivable is impaired if it is considered probable the Company will be unable to collect all contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled. In addition, all retail loans and leases which have been classified as TDRs and all customer accounts over 90 days past due are considered impaired. Generally, impaired accounts are on non-accrual status. Impaired accounts classified as TDRs which have been performing for 90 consecutive days are placed on accrual status if it is deemed probable that the Company will collect all principal and interest payments.
Impaired receivables are generally considered collateral dependent. Large balance retail and all wholesale impaired receivables are individually evaluated to determine the appropriate reserve for losses. The determination of reserves for large balance impaired receivables considers the fair value of the associated collateral. When the underlying collateral fair value exceeds the Company’s amortized cost basis, no reserve is recorded. Small balance impaired receivables with similar risk characteristics are evaluated as a separate pool to determine the appropriate reserve for losses using the historical loss and economic forecasts information discussed below.
The Company evaluates finance receivables that are not individually impaired and share similar risk characteristics on a collective basis and determines the general allowance for credit losses for both retail and wholesale receivables based on historical loss information, using past due account data, current market conditions, and expected changes in future macroeconomic conditions that affect collectability. Historical credit loss information provides relevant information of expected credit losses. The historical information used includes assumptions regarding the likelihood of collecting current and past due accounts, repossession rates, and the recovery rate on the underlying collateral based on used truck values and other pledged collateral or recourse.
The Company has developed a range of loss estimates for each of its country portfolios based on historical experience, taking into account loss frequency and severity in both strong and weak truck market conditions. A projection is made of the range of estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio from which an amount is determined based on current market conditions and other factors impacting the creditworthiness of the Company’s borrowers and their ability to repay. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for changes in forecasted economic conditions that are specific to the industry and markets in which the Company conducts business. The Company utilizes economic forecasts from third party sources and determines expected losses based on historical experience under similar market conditions. After determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses, a provision for losses on finance receivables is charged to income as necessary to reflect management’s estimate of expected credit losses, net of recoveries, inherent in the portfolio.
The adequacy of the allowance is evaluated quarterly based on the most recent past due account information and current and future market conditions. As accounts become past due, the likelihood that they will not be fully collected increases. The Company’s experience indicates the probability of not fully collecting past due accounts ranges between 30% and 70%. Over the past two years, the Company’s year-end 30+ days past due accounts have ranged between .3% and .5% of loan and lease receivables. Historically, a 100 basis point increase in the 30+ days past due percentage has resulted in an increase in credit losses of 3 to 44 basis points of receivables. At December 31, 2021, 30+ days past dues were .3%. If past dues were 100 basis points higher or 1.3% as of December 31, 2021, the Company’s estimate of credit losses would likely have increased by a range of $3 to $44 million depending on the extent of the past dues, the estimated value of the collateral as compared to amounts owed and general economic factors.
Product Warranty
Product warranty, including changes in estimates for pre-existing warranties, is disclosed in Note I of the consolidated financial statements. The expenses related to product warranty are estimated and recorded at the time products are sold based on historical and current data and reasonable expectations for the future regarding the frequency and cost of warranty claims, net of recoveries. Estimates consider product type, geographical differences, labor rates, and any other known factors affecting the number or amount of expected claim payments. For new products with no historical experience, reference to similar products is utilized. Management takes actions to minimize warranty costs through quality-improvement programs; however, actual claim costs incurred could materially differ from the estimated amounts and require adjustments to the reserve. Historically those adjustments have not been material. Over the past two years, warranty expense as a percentage of Truck, Parts and Other net sales and revenues has ranged between 1.6% and 2.2%. If the 2021 warranty expense had been .2% higher as a percentage of net sales and revenues in 2021, warranty expense would have increased by approximately $44 million.
