MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)
OVERVIEW
Whirlpool delivered record results through strong execution despite the impacts of global supply chain disruptions and inflation, alongside ongoing disruptions from COVID-19. Whirlpool delivered full-year net sales growth of 13% and GAAP net earnings available to Whirlpool of $1.8 billion (net earnings margin of 8.1%), or $28.36 per share, compared to GAAP net earnings available to Whirlpool of $1.1 billion (net earnings margin of 5.6%), or $16.98 per share in the same prior-year period. On a GAAP basis, net earnings margins were driven by price/mix and strong cost takeout actions more than offsetting $1 billion in raw material inflation costs in the period. Cash provided by operating activities of $2.2 billion, compared to $1.5 billion in 2020, was driven by higher earnings.
Whirlpool delivered ongoing (non-GAAP) earnings per share of $26.59 and full-year ongoing EBIT margin of 10.8%, compared to $18.46 and 9.0% in the same prior-year period. These results were driven by positive price/mix and cost takeout actions more than offsetting inflation, in particular in raw materials and logistics. In addition, we delivered record adjusted free cash flow(1) (non-GAAP) of $2.0 billion in 2021, compared to $1.2 billion in 2020, primarily driven by strong earnings and disciplined working capital management. Additionally, we strengthened our balance sheet and delivered on our long-term gross debt leverage target 2x, with a 2021 result of 1.8x. Lastly, we returned $1.4 billion in cash to shareholders, including an increase in our dividend and $1 billion of share repurchases. Please see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" elsewhere in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures.
We are very pleased with the agility our organization has demonstrated to deliver record results in any operating environment. This includes the successful execution of our go-to-market initiatives, furthering our digital transformation strategy and dedicated cost management. The strong actions we have taken in our international regions have led to EMEA increasing margins by 200 basis points and returning the Asia region to profitability, in line with our expectations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our strategic actions to date.
Lastly, after consistently delivering at or above our Long-term value creations goals we set in 2017, this year we introduced new, increased, long-term value creation goals. Our continued performance and strong consumer demand trends provides us confidence that we will continue to deliver strong shareholder returns in 2022.
Long-Term Value Creation Goals
Reconciliations to the equivalent GAAP measures -- net sales, net earnings, cash provided by (used in) operating activities, and return on assets -- for the metrics below are not provided as they rely on market factors and other assumptions outside of our control.
(1) Throughout 2021 and comparable periods, the Company defines adjusted free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures and including proceeds from the sale of assets/businesses, and changes in restricted cash. Going forward, the Company presents free cash flow which is cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following table summarizes the consolidated results of operations:
nm: not meaningful
Consolidated net sales for 2021 increased 13.0% compared to 2020, primarily driven by the favorable impact of product price/mix. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, net sales for 2021 increased 12.3% compared to 2020. Consolidated net sales for 2020 decreased 4.7% compared to 2019, primarily driven by the divestiture of the Embraco compressor business, lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency, partially offset by the favorable impact of product price/mix. Organic net sales (net sales excluding foreign currency and Embraco) for 2020 increased 1.1% compared to 2019.
For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures including organic net sales and net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency, see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis.
The chart below summarizes the balance of net sales by operating segment for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)
The consolidated gross margin percentage for 2021 increased to 20.1% compared to 19.7% in 2020, primarily driven by the favorable impact of product price/mix, partially offset by raw material inflation and increased marketing and technology investments. The consolidated gross margin percentage for 2020 increased to 19.7% compared to 17.2% in 2019, primarily driven by the favorable impact of product price/mix, cost reduction initiatives, raw material deflation, and a gain on sale-leaseback, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency and lower unit volumes.
Results of Operating Segments
Our operating segments are based upon geographical region and are defined as North America, EMEA, Latin America and Asia. These regions also represent our reportable segments. The chief operating decision maker, who is the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, evaluates performance based on each segment's earnings (loss) before interest and taxes (EBIT), which we define as operating profit less interest and sundry (income) expense and excluding restructuring costs, asset impairment charges and certain other items that management believes are not indicative of the region's ongoing performance, if any. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
The following is a discussion of results for each of our operating segments. Each of our operating segments has been impacted by COVID-19 in the areas of manufacturing operations such as a decrease in production levels resulting in production level below normal capacity. Excess capacity costs were not material for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 or 2020. Additionally, operating segments have been impacted by disruptions in supply chains and distribution channels, among other macroeconomic impacts.

Selling, General and Administrative
The following table summarizes selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by operating segment:
Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of consolidated net sales in 2021 is comparable to 2020. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of consolidated net sales in 2020 decreased compared to 2019 due to fixed cost actions and reduced marketing investments.
Restructuring
We incurred restructuring charges of $38 million, $288 million and $188 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the full year 2022, we expect to incur less than $50 million of restructuring charges, driven by our previously announced global cost reduction efforts.
See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangibles
No impairment charges were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021. We recorded an immaterial impairment charge related to other intangibles for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to a brand in the EMEA reporting unit.
See Note 6 and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information.
(Gain) Loss on Sale and Disposal of Businesses
On May 6, 2021, the partial tender offer for Whirlpool China was completed and, subsequent to the deconsolidation of the entity, we recorded a gain of $284 million in the third quarter of 2021.
On June 30 2021, we completed the sale of our Turkish subsidiary and incurred a loss of $164 million in the second quarter of 2021. During the third quarter of 2021, an additional loss of $13 million related to the final purchase price adjustments was recorded, increasing the total loss to $177 million.
We recorded a pre-tax gain of $511 million on the sale of the Embraco compressor business for the year ended December 31, 2019. A $7 million gain related to final purchase price adjustments relating to the sale of the Embraco compressor business was recorded in the third quarter of 2020.

Interest and Sundry (Income) Expense
Interest and sundry (income) expenses were $(159) million, $(21) million and $(168) million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Net interest and sundry income increased $138 million in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to a gain of $42 million on previously held equity interest of 49% in Elica PB India and the higher expense of pension settlements and other postretirement benefit plans in the prior year.
Net interest and sundry income decreased $147 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the effect of Brazil indirect tax credits and trade customer insolvency claim settlement in 2019, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency in 2020.
See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $175 million, $189 million and $187 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Interest expense decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to short-term debt reduction. Interest expense was comparable in 2020 to 2019.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense was $518 million, $382 million and $348 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in tax expense in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily due to higher earnings and related tax expense, audits and settlements, partially offset by legal entity restructuring tax benefits. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a $98 million reserve related to an unfavorable ruling in our ongoing tax litigation described in Note 15.
The increase in tax expense in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily due to changes in valuation allowance, legal entity restructuring tax benefits, and earnings dispersion related to the sale of Embraco.
See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)
FORWARD-LOOKING PERSPECTIVE
Based on internal projections for the industry and broader economy, we currently estimate earnings per diluted share and industry demand for 2022 to be within the following ranges:
For the full-year 2022, we expect the following key trends to continue and have incorporated our latest expectations of these in our guidance: continued supply constraints and elevated inflationary costs, as well as positive price/mix led by previously announced cost-based price increases. Our anticipated tax rate is between 24.0% and 26.0%. Additionally, we expect to generate cash from operating activities of $2.2 billion and free cash flow of $1.5 billion, including restructuring cash outlays of approximately $50 million and, with respect to free cash flow, capital expenditures of approximately $700 million.
The table below reconciles projected 2022 cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP to free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure. Management believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing Whirlpool's ability to fund its activities and obligations. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures, including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similarly named non-GAAP measures whose calculations may differ from our calculations. For 2022 we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures, see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of Management's Discussion and Analysis.
(1)Financial guidance on a GAAP basis for cash provided by (used in) financing activities and cash provided by (used in) investing activities has not been provided because in order to prepare any such estimate or projection, the Company would need to rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of its control.
The projections above are based on many estimates and are inherently subject to change based on future decisions made by management and the Board of Directors of Whirlpool, and significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, some of which we refer to as "ongoing" measures, including:
•Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)
•EBIT margin
•Ongoing EBIT
•Ongoing earnings per diluted share
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)
•Ongoing EBIT margin
•Sales excluding foreign currency
•Organic net sales (net sales excluding foreign currency and Embraco)
•Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow
•Gross debt leverage
Ongoing measures, including ongoing earnings per diluted share and ongoing EBIT, exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing operations and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. EBIT margin is calculated by dividing EBIT by net sales. Sales excluding foreign currency is calculated by translating the current period net sales, in functional currency, to U.S. dollars using the prior-year period's exchange rate compared to the prior-year period net sales. Organic net sales is calculated by excluding divestitures and foreign currency. Management believes that organic net sales and sales excluding foreign currency provides stockholders with a clearer basis to assess our results over time, excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, and in the case of organic net sales, excluding the impact of our Embraco compressor business divested in July 2019. Management believes that Gross Debt Leverage (Gross Debt/Ongoing EBITDA) provides stockholders with a clearer basis to assess the Company's ability to pay off its incurred debt. We also disclose segment EBIT, which we define as operating profit less interest and sundry (income) expense and excluding restructuring costs, asset impairment charges and certain other items, if any, that management believes are not indicative of the region's ongoing performance, as the financial metric used by the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker to evaluate performance and allocate resources in accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting. Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing Whirlpool's ability to fund its activities and obligations. The Company provides free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow related metrics, such as free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of net sales, as long-term management goals, not an element of its annual financial guidance, and as such does not provide a reconciliation of free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow to cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for these long-term goal metrics. Any such reconciliation would rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of the Company's control. Whirlpool does not provide a non-GAAP reconciliation for its other forward-looking long-term value creation and other goals, such as organic net sales, EBIT, and gross debt/Ongoing EBITDA, as such reconciliation would rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of the company’s control.
We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and stockholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance, and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of our business. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported net earnings (loss) available to Whirlpool, net sales, net earnings as a percentage of net sales (net earnings margin), net earnings (loss) per diluted share and cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)
Please refer to a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below.
(1)Net earnings margin is approximately 8.1%, 5.5% and 5.7% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and is calculated by dividing net earnings (loss) available to Whirlpool by consolidated net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
(2)Ongoing EBIT margin is approximately 10.8%, 9.0% and 6.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Ongoing EBIT margin is calculated by dividing Ongoing EBIT by consolidated net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)
Throughout 2021 and comparable periods, the Company defines adjusted free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures and including proceeds from the sale of assets/businesses, and changes in restricted cash. Going forward, the Company presents free cash flow which is cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures.
(3)See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
(4)Proceeds from the sale of assets and business for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 include $1.0 billion of net cash proceeds received for the sale of the Embraco compressor business; $1.0 billion of these proceeds were used to repay an outstanding term loan in August 2019.

Footnotes
(a) RESTRUCTURING EXPENSE - In 2019, these costs were primarily related to actions that rightsize our EMEA business and certain other unique restructuring events, including restructuring of the Naples, Italy manufacturing plant.
In 2020, these costs were primarily related to actions that right-size and reduce the fixed cost structure of our global business, attributable primarily to the macroeconomic uncertainties caused by COVID-19. This includes costs of approximately $100 million related to restructuring in the United States and approximately $188 million related to restructuring outside of the United States, including the exit of our Naples, Italy facility. In 2021, these costs were primarily related to actions that right-size and reduce the fixed cost structure of our EMEA business and other centralized functions.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)
(b) (GAIN) LOSS ON PREVIOUSLY HELD EQUITY INTEREST - During the third quarter of 2021, our subsidiary Whirlpool of India Ltd. acquired an additional 38% equity interest in Elica PB India Private Limited (Elica PB India) for $57 million, which resulted in a controlling equity ownership of approximately 87%. The previously held equity interest of 49% in Elica PB India was remeasured at fair value of $74 million on the acquisition date, which resulted in a gain of $42 million. This gain was recorded within Interest & sundry (income) expense during the third quarter. The earnings per diluted share impact is calculated net of minority interest.
(c) (GAIN) LOSS ON SALE AND DISPOSAL OF BUSINESSES - On March 31, 2021, Galanz launched its partial tender offer for majority ownership of Whirlpool China. Our subsidiary tendered approximately 31% of Whirlpool China's outstanding shares in the tender offer, with the remainder representing a noncontrolling interest of approximately 20% in Whirlpool China. The transaction closed on May 6, 2021. In connection with the closing of the transaction, we received cash proceeds of $193 million and recognized a gain on sale of $284 million.
On May 17, 2021, our subsidiary entered into a share purchase agreement to sell its Turkish subsidiary to Arçelik. As part of the agreement, Arçelik assumed responsibility for operating the manufacturing site in Manisa, Turkey, following closing. The transaction closed on June 30, 2021. In connection with the closing of the transaction, we received cash proceeds of $93 million and recognized a loss on sale of $164 million. During the third quarter of 2021, amounts for working capital and other customary post-closing adjustments were finalized and an additional $13 million loss related to the sale of business was recorded.
The net impact realized for gain on sale and disposal of businesses included in the income statement for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 is $105 million.
During the third quarter of 2019, the Company reserved approximately $7 million for an expected change in purchase price for the sale of the Embraco compressor business. Adjustments to the final purchase price were finalized as of the third quarter 2020, with no resulting change to the final purchase price, and the reserve was released and recognized as a gain during the quarter.
(d) PRODUCT WARRANTY AND LIABILITY (INCOME) EXPENSE - In September 2015, the Company recorded a liability related to a corrective action affecting certain legacy Indesit products. During the second and third quarters of 2019, the Company incurred additional product warranty expense related to this previously disclosed legacy Indesit dryer corrective action campaign in the UK for approximately $12 million and $14 million, respectively. In the third quarter of 2019, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $105 million for estimated product warranty expense related to certain EMEA-produced washers for which the Company commenced a recall in January 2020.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company released an accrual of approximately $30 million related to this EMEA-produced washer recall campaign. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company further released an accrual of approximately $9 million. These adjustments were made based on our revised expectations regarding future period cash expenditures for the campaign.
(e) CORRECTIVE ACTION RECOVERY - The Company recorded a benefit of $13 million in the third quarter of 2020 and $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to a vendor recovery in our ongoing EMEA-produced washer corrective action.
(f) SALE-LEASEBACK, REAL ESTATE AND RECEIVABLE ADJUSTMENTS - In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company sold certain owned properties, primarily warehouses, while agreeing to lease these same properties from the purchaser. As part of the sale, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain on sale of the group of properties of approximately $111 million and a cash benefit of approximately $140 million. In addition, the Company wrote off the full loan receivable amount outstanding of approximately $18 million related to a previous loan between the Company and a not-for-profit entity in connection with a community and economic development project. The Company also wrote-down the book value of certain real estate properties, recognizing a loss of approximately $7 million.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company sold and leased back a group of properties for net proceeds of approximately $139 million. The transaction met the requirements for sale leaseback

accounting. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recorded the sale of the properties, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $113 million.
(g) TRADE CUSTOMER INSOLVENCY CLAIM SETTLEMENT - In January 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with the insolvency trustee for Alno AG, a former trade customer of a Company subsidiary in which the Company subsidiary held a minority equity interest, to settle all potential claims that the insolvency trustee may have against the Company subsidiary related to the Alno insolvency, resulting in a one-time charge of €52.75 million ($59 million as of December 31, 2019).
(h) BRAZIL INDIRECT TAX CREDIT - During the first half of 2019, the Company received favorable, non-appealable decisions related to the recovery of certain taxes previously paid over gross sales. As a result, the Company recorded a gain in interest and sundry (income) expense during the first and second quarter of 2019 in the amount of $127 million and $53 million, respectively, in connection with these decisions.
(i) NORMALIZED TAX RATE ADJUSTMENT - For 2020 and 2021, the full-year effective tax rates were 26.3% and 23.5%, respectively.
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
Our objective is to finance our business through operating cash flow and the appropriate mix of long-term and short-term debt. By diversifying the maturity structure, we avoid concentrations of debt, reducing liquidity risk. We have varying needs for short-term working capital financing as a result of the nature of our business. We regularly review our capital structure and liquidity priorities, which include funding innovation and growth through capital, research and development expenditures as well as opportunistic mergers and acquisitions; and providing returns to shareholders through dividends, share repurchases and maintaining our strong investment grade rating.
The Company believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing Whirlpool's ability to fund its activities and obligations. Whirlpool has historically been able to leverage its strong free cash flow generation to fund our operations, pay for any debt servicing costs and allocate capital for reinvestment in our business, funding share repurchases and dividend payments.
Our short term potential uses of liquidity include funding our ongoing capital spending, restructuring activities, and returns to shareholders. We also have $298 million of term debt maturing in the next twelve months, and are currently evaluating our options in connection with this maturing debt, which may include repayment through refinancing, free cash flow generation or cash on hand.
The Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.0 billion at December 31, 2021, of which approximately half was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries. For each of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the United States. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and expected future foreign investments. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the cash to fund our U.S. operations. However, if these funds were repatriated, we would be required to accrue and pay applicable United States taxes (if any) and withholding taxes payable to various countries. It is not practical to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability associated with the repatriation of cash due to the complexity of its hypothetical calculation.
At December 31, 2021, we had cash or cash equivalents greater than 1% of our consolidated assets in the United States, Switzerland, Brazil and India, which represented 7.3%, 1.8%, 1.4%, and 1.0%, respectively. In addition, we had third-party accounts receivable outside of the United States greater than 1% of our consolidated assets in Brazil and Italy, which represented 1.4% and 1.3%, respectively. We continue to monitor general financial instability and uncertainty globally.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)
Notes payable consists of short-term borrowings payable to banks and commercial paper, which are generally used to fund working capital requirements. At December 31, 2021, we had $10 million of notes payable outstanding. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
We monitor the credit ratings and market indicators of credit risk of our lending, depository, derivative counterparty banks and customers regularly, and take certain action to manage credit risk. We diversify our deposits and investments in short-term cash equivalents to limit the concentration of exposure by counterparty. We also continue to review customer conditions globally.
In the past, when faced with a potential volume reduction from any one particular segment of our trade distribution network, we generally have been able to offset such declines through increased sales throughout our broad distribution network.

Sources and Uses of Cash
We met our cash needs during 2021 through cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and financing arrangements. Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at December 31, 2021 increased $110 million compared to the same period in 2020.
The following table summarizes the net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the periods presented. Significant drivers of changes in our cash and cash equivalents balance during 2021 are discussed below:
Cash Flow Summary
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities in 2021 increased compared to 2020. The increase was primarily driven by strong cash earnings and improvements in working capital. The improvement in working capital was driven by increased accounts payable due to raw material inflation, partially offset by increased inventory due to higher input costs and a modest inventory build.
Cash provided by operating activities in 2020 increased compared to 2019. The increase was primarily driven by strong cash earnings partially offset by working capital initiatives. Working capital was impacted by our ongoing accounts receivable and credit management actions, along with inventory management. Additionally, working capital was impacted by increased accounts payable driven by higher year end production levels, partially offset by the timing of our year end payment schedule.
The timing of cash flows from operations varies significantly throughout the year primarily due to changes in production levels, sales patterns, promotional programs, funding requirements, credit
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)
management, as well as receivable and payment terms. Depending on the timing of cash flows, the location of cash balances, as well as the liquidity requirements of each country, external sources of funding are used to support working capital requirements.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2021 primarily reflects the cash impacts from the divestiture of Whirlpool China (approximately $341 million) and our Turkey manufacturing subsidiary (approximately $52 million) as well as an increase in capital expenditures (approximately $115 million).
The increase in cash provided by investing activities during 2020 primarily reflects the 2019 proceeds from the sale of the Embraco compressor business (approximately $1 billion), partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures (approximately $122 million) and the proceeds from a real estate sale-leaseback transaction (approximately $139 million).
The increase in cash provided by investing activities during 2019 primarily reflects proceeds from the sale of the Embraco compressor business (approximately $1 billion) along with proceeds from a real estate sale-leaseback transaction (approximately $140 million) and a decrease in capital expenditures (approximately $60 million).
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
The increase in cash used in financing activities during 2021 primarily reflects lower debt issuance proceeds (approximately $733 million) along with higher share repurchases (approximately $920 million) partially offset by lower repayments of long-term debt (increase of approximately $273 million) net effect of reduced short-term debt (increase of approximately $330 million).
The decrease in cash used in financing activities during 2020 primarily reflects higher debt issuance proceeds (increase of approximately $300 million), lower repayments of long-term debt (increase of approximately $400 million) net effect of reduced short-term debt (increase of approximately $400 million). Short-term debt reflects the activity on the $1 billion term loan that was borrowed in 2018 and repaid in 2019, offset by the reduced need to fund working capital through short term debt.
The increase in cash used in financing activities during 2019 primarily reflects higher repayments of long-term debt (increase of approximately $550 million), net effect of changes in short-term debt (increase of approximately $1.4 billion), partially offset by lower share repurchase activity (decrease of approximately $1 billion). Short-term debt reflects the activity on the $1 billion term loan that was borrowed in 2018 and repaid in 2019, offset by changes in commercial paper for funding normal working capital requirements.
Dividends paid in financing activities were $338 million, $311 million, and $305 million during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Financing Arrangements
At December 31, 2021, the Company had total committed credit facilities of approximately $3.7 billion and $4.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The facilities are geographically diverse and reflect the Company's global operations. The Company believes these facilities are sufficient to support its global operations. We had no borrowings outstanding under the committed credit facilities at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)
Other material obligations include off-balance sheet arrangements arising in the normal course of business. They primarily consist of agreements we enter into with financial institutions to issue bank guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds. These agreements are primarily associated with unresolved tax matters in Brazil, as is customary under local regulations, and other governmental obligations and debt agreements. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had approximately $294 million and $423 million outstanding under these agreements, respectively.
Additionally, we have material contractual obligations. They primarily consist of long-term debt obligations, operating lease obligations, purchase obligations, taxes, United States and foreign pension plans and other postretirement benefits. See Notes 1, 3, 7-10 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Dividends
In April 2021, our Board of Directors approved a 12.0% increase in our quarterly dividend on our common stock to $1.40 per share from $1.25 per share, representing the 9th consecutive year of increased dividends.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with GAAP, requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience, forecasted events, changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the costs of future benefits and attributing the cost over the employee's expected period of employment. The determination of our obligation and expense for these costs requires the use of certain assumptions. Those key assumptions include the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, life expectancy, and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are subject to change based on interest rates on high quality bonds, stock and bond markets and medical cost inflation, respectively. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and actual experience, significant differences in results or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related future expense.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)
Our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations at December 31, 2021 and preliminary retirement benefit costs for 2022 were prepared using the assumptions that were determined as of December 31, 2021. The following table summarizes the sensitivity of our December 31, 2021 retirement obligations and 2022 retirement benefit costs of our United States plans to changes in the key assumptions used to determine those results:
(1)Projected benefit obligation (PBO) for pension plans and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) for other postretirement benefit plans.
These sensitivities may not be appropriate to use for other years' financial results. Furthermore, the impact of assumption changes outside of the ranges shown above may not be approximated by using the above results. For additional information about our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Income Taxes
We estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items, such as the timing for recognizing expenses, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences may result in deferred tax assets or liabilities, which are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We are required to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss carryforwards, general business credits and deductible temporary differences, will be realizable in future years. Realization of our net operating loss and general business credit deferred tax assets is supported by specific tax planning strategies and, where possible, considers projections of future profitability. If recovery is not more likely than not, we provide a valuation allowance based on estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions, for the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable. If future taxable income is lower than expected or if tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated, we may record additional valuation allowances through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of net recorded amounts, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will benefit income tax expense in the period such determination is made.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had total deferred tax assets of $3.0 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, net of valuation allowances of $195 million and $214 million, respectively. The Company has established tax planning strategies and transfer pricing policies to provide sufficient future taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets. Our income tax expense has fluctuated considerably over the last five years. The tax expense has been influenced primarily by foreign tax credits, audit settlements and adjustments, tax planning strategies, enacted legislation, and dispersion of global income. Future changes in the effective tax rate will be subject to several factors, including business profitability, tax planning strategies, and enacted tax laws.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)
We have various tax filings with applicable jurisdictions to defend our positions with regards to the timing and amount of deductions and credits as well as the allocation of income across various jurisdictions. We regularly inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken to ensure the timely recording of liabilities for tax positions that may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. We believe that our estimates and judgements with respect to uncertain tax positions are reasonable and accurate at the time they are developed. However, actual results may differ due to unforeseen future events and circumstances. If one or more of the applicable taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefits we have recorded, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.
In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and could result in outcomes that are unfavorable to the Company. For additional information about income taxes, see Note 1, Note 8 and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Warranty Obligations
The estimation of warranty obligations is determined in the same period that revenue from the sale of the related products is recognized. The warranty obligation is based on historical experience and represents our best estimate of expected costs at the time products are sold. Warranty accruals are adjusted for known or anticipated warranty claims as new information becomes available. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Future events and circumstances could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to the warranty obligations. For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, warranty expense as a percentage of consolidated Net sales approximated 1.5% and 1.4%, respectively. For additional information about warranty obligations, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles
Certain business acquisitions have resulted in the recording of goodwill and trademark assets which are not amortized. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had goodwill of approximately $2.5 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. We have trademark assets with a carrying value of approximately $1.9 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
We perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of October 1st or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We consider qualitative factors to assess if it is more likely than not that the fair value for goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets is below the carrying amount. We may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment.
In conducting a qualitative assessment, the Company analyzes a variety of events or factors that may influence the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible, including, but not limited to: the results of prior quantitative assessments performed; changes in the carrying amount of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible; actual and projected revenue and EBIT margin; relevant market data for both the Company and its peer companies; industry outlooks; macroeconomic conditions; liquidity; changes in key personnel; and the Company's competitive position. Significant judgment is used to evaluate the totality of these events and factors to make the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible is less than its carrying value.
For our annual impairment assessment as of October 1, 2021, the Company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment to evaluate goodwill and certain brand trademarks. The Company elected to perform a qualitative assessment on the other indefinite-lived intangible assets noting no events that indicated that the fair value was less than the carrying value that would require a quantitative impairment assessment.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)
Goodwill Valuations
In performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate each reporting unit's fair value primarily by using the income approach. The income approach uses each reporting unit's projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a market participant discount rate based on a weighted-average cost of capital. The financial projections reflect management's best estimate of economic and market conditions over the five-year projected period including forecasted revenue growth, EBIT margin, tax rate, capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization and changes in working capital requirements. Other assumptions include discount rate and terminal growth rate. For one of our reporting units we use a blended approach that includes a market capitalization methodology given publicly available information and a discounted cash flow approach. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to their respective carrying values.
Additionally we validate our estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the values to fair value estimates using a market approach. A market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the operating performance of each reporting unit. The multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting units. We also corroborate the fair value through a market capitalization reconciliation to determine whether the implied control premium is reasonable based on recent market transactions and other qualitative considerations.
Based on the results of our annual quantitative assessment performed as of October 1, 2021, the fair values of our North America, Asia, EMEA and Latin America reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by 306%, 258%, 29% and 20%, respectively.
If actual results are not consistent with management's estimates and assumptions, a material impairment charge of goodwill could occur, which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Valuations
In performing a quantitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill, primarily trademarks, we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relief-from-royalty method which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our annual long-range plan; assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademark; and a market participant discount rate based on a weighted-average cost of capital. If the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, we would recognize an impairment loss.
The fair value of the Maytag trademark exceeded its carrying value of $1,021 million by approximately 11%. We expect future fiscal year revenue for this brand to improve as we recover from temporary volume loss from supply chain disruptions and continue to execute our brand leadership strategy and benefit from our new product investments.
The fair values of all other trademarks exceeded their carrying values by an amount sufficient to not be deemed "at risk".
In performing the quantitative assessment on these assets, significant assumptions used in our relief-from-royalty model included revenue growth rates, assumed royalty rates and the discount rate, which are discussed further below.
Revenue growth rates relate to projected revenues from our financial planning and analysis process and vary from brand to brand. Adverse changes in the operating environment or our inability to grow revenues at the forecasted rates may result in a material impairment charge. We performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair values noting a 10% reduction of forecasted revenues in the Maytag trademark would reduce the fair value of the trademark to its carrying value.
In determining royalty rates for the valuation of our trademarks, we considered factors that affect the assumed royalty rates that would hypothetically be paid by a market participant for the use of
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)
trademarks. The most significant factors in determining the assumed royalty rates include the overall role and importance of the trademarks in the particular industry, the profitability of the products utilizing the trademarks, and the position of the trademarked products in the given product category. Based on this analysis, we determined a royalty rate of 4% for the Maytag trademark. We performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair value of Maytag, noting a 50 basis point reduction of the royalty rate would result in an impairment charge of approximately $24 million.
In developing discount rates for the valuation of our trademarks, we used a market participant discount rate based on a weighted-average cost of capital, adjusted for higher relative level of risks associated with doing business in other countries, as applicable, as well as the higher relative levels of risks associated with intangible assets. Based on this analysis, we determined the discount rate to be 10.25% for Maytag. We performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair value for Maytag noting a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in an impairment charge of approximately $8 million.
Based on our quantitative impairment assessment as of October 1, 2020, the carrying value of the Hotpoint* trademark exceeded its fair value by €6 million, approximately $7 million USD, and we recorded an intangible impairment charge in this amount during the fourth quarter of 2020. There were no other impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2020 or 2021.
If actual results are not consistent with management's estimate and assumptions, a material impairment charge of our trademarks could occur, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.
For additional information about goodwill and indefinite-life intangible valuations, see Note 6 and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The estimates of future cash flows used in determining the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets involve significant management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, economic conditions, market conditions and cost of capital. Inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control, such as changes in capital markets. The actual cash flows could differ materially from management's estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance and economic conditions.
ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
For additional information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
OTHER MATTERS
For additional information regarding certain of our loss contingencies/litigation, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Unfavorable outcomes in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements in any particular reporting period.
Antidumping and Safeguard Petition
As previously reported, Whirlpool filed petitions in 2011 and 2015 alleging that Samsung, LG and Electrolux violated U.S. and international trade laws by dumping large residential washers into the U.S. Those petitions resulted in orders imposing antidumping duties on certain large residential washers imported from South Korea, Mexico, and China, and countervailing duties on certain large residential washers from South Korea. In March 2019, the order covering certain large residential washers from Mexico was extended for an additional five years, while the order covering certain large residential washers from South Korea was revoked. The order covering certain large residential washers from China is currently subject to administrative review to determine whether the order should be extended.
*Whirlpool ownership of the Hotpoint brand in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions is not affiliated with the Hotpoint brand sold in the Americas.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)
Whirlpool also filed a safeguard petition in May 2017 to address our concerns that Samsung and LG were evading U.S. trade laws by moving production from countries covered by antidumping orders. A safeguard remedy went into effect in February 2018, implementing tariffs on finished large residential washers and certain covered parts for three years. In January 2021, the remedy was extended for two years until February 2023. During the fourth year of the remedy, beginning February 7, 2021, the remedy imposes a 15% tariff on the first 1.2 million large residential washers imported into the United States (under tariff) and a 35% tariff on such imports in excess of 1.2 million, and also imposes a 35% tariff on washer tub, drum, and cabinet imports in excess of 110,000. Consistent with modifications to the order approved in 2020, the 1.2 million under tariff is allocated by quarter (300,000 large residential washers per quarter). We cannot speculate on the modification's impact in future quarters, which will depend on Samsung and LG's U.S. production capabilities and import plans. These orders are subject to administrative reviews and possible appeals.
Raw Materials and Global Economy
The current domestic and international political environment have contributed to uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy. We have experienced raw material inflation in certain prior years based on the impact of U.S. tariffs and other global macroeconomic factors. Due to many factors beyond our control, we expect to continue to be impacted by the following factors: global shortage of certain components, other supply chain constraints and cost inflation, all of which we expect to continue in 2022. This could require us to modify our current business practices, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements in any particular reporting period.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. Certain statements contained in this annual report, including those within the forward-looking perspective section within the Management's Discussion and Analysis section, and other written and oral statements made from time to time by us or on our behalf do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance.
