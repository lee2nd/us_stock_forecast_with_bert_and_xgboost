Critical Accounting Policies - a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates.
We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements.
Overview
Our core business is based on the leasing of patented tracking and monitoring solutions to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, both in the U.S. and abroad, for the electronic monitoring of offenders and offering unique data analytics services on a platform-as-a-service (“PaaS”) business model. Currently, we deploy offender-based management services that combine patented GPS tracking technologies, fulltime 24/7/365 global monitoring capabilities, case management, and proprietary data analytics. We offer customizable tracking solutions that leverage real-time tracking data, best practices monitoring, and analytics capabilities to create complete, end-to-end tracking solutions.
Recent Developments
Manufacturing of New Devices
In September 2022, the Company received one component after an extended delay which allowed us to resume the manufacturing of antennae circuit boards required to build new devices for both existing and new customers.
Results of Operations
Continuing Operations - Fiscal 2022 Compared to Fiscal 2021
Revenue
During Fiscal 2022, we had revenue of $36,968,499 compared to revenue of $39,661,325 for Fiscal 2021, a decrease of $2,692,826, or approximately 7%. Of this revenue, $35,768,090 and $39,179,699 were from monitoring and other related services revenue during Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, respectively, representing a decrease of $3,411,609 or approximately 9%. The decrease in revenue was principally the result of a decrease of our North American monitoring operations driven by clients in Illinois, Virginia, the Bahamas and Indiana, partially offset by increases of our customers in Saudi Arabia, Canada and Chile.
Product and other revenue for Fiscal 2022 increased to $1,200,409 from $481,626 in the same period in 2021, an increase of $718,783 or approximately 149%. The increase in product and other revenue was largely due to higher international product sales, principally in Saudi Arabia. We continue to largely focus on recurring subscription-based opportunities as opposed to equipment sales.
The industry in which the Company operates, as well as many other industries (automotive, consumer products and medical devices), have been impacted by the global semiconductor shortage initially caused by the slowdown of many chip makers and logistics companies due to COVID-19. The availability of semiconductor parts has improved in the second half of calendar 2022; however, long lead time remain with certain parts. As a result, until such time as chip manufacturers are able to meet global demand, our future operating results may be negatively impacted.
Cost of Revenue
During Fiscal 2022, cost of revenue totaled $19,615,543, compared to cost of revenue during Fiscal 2021 of $18,554,011, an increase of $1,061,532, or approximately 6%. The increase in cost of revenue was largely the result of higher software amortization of $930,163, higher server costs of $416,517, higher communication costs of $119,119 and higher repair costs of $265,700. These increases were offset by lower lost, stolen and damaged device costs of $96,167, lower monitoring costs of $627,160, lower commission costs of $74,654 and lower device amortization of $94,560.
Depreciation and amortization included in cost of revenue for Fiscal Years 2022 and 2021, totaled $3,237,970 and $2,402,367, respectively. The increase of $835,603, or approximately 35%, largely represents software amortization of our new monitoring platform which began in July 2021. Amortization of a patent related to GPS and satellite tracking are also included in depreciation and amortization. Devices are depreciated over either a three- or five-year useful life. Monitoring software is amortized over a seven-year life. Royalty agreements are being amortized over a ten-year useful life. The Company believes these lives are appropriate due to changes in electronic monitoring technology and the corresponding potential for obsolescence. Management periodically assesses the useful life of the devices for appropriateness.
Gross Profit and Margin
During Fiscal 2022, gross profit totaled $17,352,956, resulting in a 47% gross margin, compared to $21,107,314, or a 53% gross margin, during Fiscal 2021, a decrease of $3,754,358. The decrease in absolute gross profit of $3,754,358 is due to a decrease in revenue of $2,692,826 and increases in certain costs of revenue, including higher depreciation and amortization costs of $835,603, higher server costs, higher device repair costs, higher software maintenance costs, higher communication costs and higher product sales costs, partially offset by lower monitoring costs and lower lost, stolen and damaged costs.
General and Administrative Expense
During Fiscal 2022, our general and administrative expense totaled $12,462,931, compared to $10,232,116 for Fiscal 2021. The increase of $2,230,815, or approximately 22%, in general and administrative cost resulted largely from the impairment of intangible assets of $1,728,961 associated with the discontinuance of two product lines, higher insurance costs of $268,307, higher legal and professional fees of $372,987, partially offset by lower payroll expense of $601,108 and lower bad debt of $142,123.
Selling and Marketing Expense
For Fiscal 2022, our selling and marketing expense was $2,993,749 compared to $2,716,283 for Fiscal 2021. The increase of $277,466 or approximately 10% resulted largely from higher wages and related payroll taxes of $85,993, higher travel costs of $70,189 and higher trade show costs of $64,664.
Research and Development Expense
During Fiscal 2022, we incurred research and development expense of $2,432,448 compared to those costs recognized during Fiscal 2021 totaling $1,548,527, an increase of $883,921 or approximately 57%. The increase was largely the result of continuous improvements of our existing software, resulting in increased payroll and related tax expense of $689,222 after our implementation and subsequent commencement of amortization of our new monitoring software, higher outside service costs of $38,920 and higher travel costs of $35,461. As a result of the implementation of our new monitoring software on July 1, 2021, capitalization of developed technology decreased to $865,263 during Fiscal 2022, which represents technology projects currently in development, compared to $1,349,550, which was capitalized in Fiscal 2021. A portion of this expense would have been recognized as research and development expense, absent the significant enhancements to the technology.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense
We maintain a significant portion of our tangible and intangible assets that are amortized or depreciated. During Fiscal 2022, depreciation and amortization included in operating expense totaled $1,563,729, compared to $1,896,481 for Fiscal 2021. This was a decrease of $332,752, or approximately 18%, was largely due to fully depreciated assets.
Other Income (Expense)
During Fiscal 2022, total other expense was $4,406,973 compared to $554,392 during Fiscal 2021, an increase of $3,852,581. The increase in Fiscal 2022 was primarily due to a legal settlement of $1,600,000 offset principally by the forgiveness of an accrued expense by a significant vendor of approximately $633,000, compared to income from extinguishment of debt of $1,000,756 related principally to the forgiveness of a $932,000 PPP loan and a note receivable of $67,566 in Fiscal 2021, negative exchange rate movement of $2,234,379 caused by the approximate 19% appreciation of the US Dollar vs. the Chilean Peso in Fiscal 2022 and lower interest expense of $200,806. The lower interest expense was primarily due to the restructuring of the Conrent Amended Facility. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Income taxes
During Fiscal 2022, income tax expense totaled $883,488 compared to $717,109 during Fiscal 2021. Tax expense in both fiscal years are income taxes largely related to a foreign jurisdiction.
Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders
We had a net loss for Fiscal 2022 totaling ($7,390,362) or $(0.64) and $(0.64) per basic and diluted common share, respectively, compared to net income of $3,442,406 or $0.30 and $0.29 per basic and diluted common share for Fiscal 2021. This net loss is largely due to lower gross profit, higher general and administrative expense, higher selling and marketing expense, higher research and development expense, higher other expense and higher tax expense, partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization. The higher general and administrative expense was primarily due to the impairment of intangible assets.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company is currently self-funded through net cash provided by operating activities. As of September 30, 2022, excluding interest, approximately $42.9 million is still owed to Conrent under the Amended Facility.
On May 19, 2020, the Company received net proceeds of $933,200 from the PPP Loan received pursuant to the PPP enacted by Congress under the CARES Act, administered by the SBA. On December 8, 2020, the Company filed the application for forgiveness with the Lender and on January 8, 2021, the Company received a notification from the Lender that the SBA remitted funds to fully repay the PPP Loan, and that the funds were utilized to pay-off and close the PPP Loan and that the PPP Loan was fully forgiven.
On October 21, 2020, the Company requested, in writing, an additional extension to the maturity date of the $30.4 million Amended Facility Agreement. On November 25, 2020, the Noteholders held a meeting to address the Company’s request and approved a new maturity date of July 1, 2024. On December 21, 2020, Conrent and the Company signed the Amended Facility, which extended the maturity date of the Amended Facility Agreement to July 1, 2024, capitalized the accrued and unpaid interest which increased the outstanding principal amount and reduced the interest rate of the Amended Facility from 8% to 4%. On March 1, 2021, Conrent completed their documentation and the updated registration process to implement these changes and the Company transferred $12,531,556 of accrued interest to the note payable for total principal of $42,931,556. Conrent forgave $67,556 of the amount due and the new Amended Facility principal and interest became $42,864,000. Interest payments were scheduled to be made on June 30 and December 31 each year, which began on June 30, 2021. We began amortizing deferred financing fees of approximately $360,000 on July 1, 2021. As of September 30, 2022, $42,864,000 of principal and $438,165 of interest was owed to Conrent.
On January 6, 2021, the Company borrowed 70,443,375 Chilean Pesos (“CLP”) ($101,186USD) from HP Financial Services Chile Limitada. To facilitate the Loan, the Company entered into a Note Payable Agreement with HP Financial Services Chile Limitada as lender. The loan was used to purchase PABX (private automatic branch exchange phone equipment) for the construction of the Gendarmeria de Chile monitoring centers in Santiago and Puerto Montt, Chile. The loan bears an interest rate of 6.56% per annum, payable monthly with principal beginning February 2021, and a maturity date of February 6, 2024.
On January 12, 2021, the Company borrowed 347,198,500CLP ($482,965USD), net of 2,801,500CLP fees ($3,897USD), from Banco Santander. To facilitate the Loan, the Company entered into a Note Payable Agreement with Banco Santander as lender. The loan was used to comply with the construction of Gendarmeria de Chile monitoring center in Santiago, Chile and remodeling a temporary monitoring center. The loan bears an interest at a rate of 5.04% per annum, payable monthly with principal beginning February 2021, and a maturity of May 11, 2024.

The loan provided was used for the construction of the Gendarmeria de Chile monitoring center in Santiago city and computer equipment for Gendarmeria branch offices. The loan bears an interest rate of 3.50% per annum, initially having a 6-month grace period with the first payment including the 6 months of interest plus 1 month of principal on August 2, 2021, then monthly interest with principal, and a maturity date of January 2, 2024. The Company also paid 14,124,294CLP ($19,304USD) in broker fees which are amortized over the life of the loan.
On February 4, 2021, the Company borrowed 149,794,432CLP ($205,330USD) from HP Financial Services Chile Limitada. To facilitate the Loan, the Company entered into a Note Payable Agreement with HP Financial Services Chile Limitada as lender.

The Company also paid 28,248,588CLP ($38,317USD) in broker fees which are amortized over the life of the loan.
No additional funds were borrowed in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the loan balances at September 30, 2022.
Management will continue to seek other sources of capital, refinancing options, prepayment of debt at a discount and potentially other transactions including the exchange of some debt for an equity related security to reduce its total debt and assist in meeting all of its future obligations. While management believes it will be successful in completing one of these alternatives prior to the maturity of the Amended Facility Agreement in July 2024, no assurances can be given.
Net Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities.
During Fiscal 2022, we had net loss of ($7,390,362) and we had cash flows from operating activities of $802,961, compared to net income from continuing operations of $3,442,406 and cash flows from operating activities of $4,822,182 for Fiscal 2021. The decrease in cash from operations was largely the result of lower operating income and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by a lower use of cash related to performance bonds and monitoring center assets and a decline in accounts receivable.
Net Cash Flows used in Investing Activities.
The Company used $3,060,280 of cash for investing activities during Fiscal 2022, compared to $4,507,696 of cash used during Fiscal 2021, a decrease of $1,447,416. Cash used for investing activities was used for significant enhancements of our software platform and for purchases of monitoring and other equipment to meet customer demand during Fiscal 2022. Capitalized software decreased by $484,287 compared to the prior period.
Net Cash Flows Provided by (used in) Financing Activities.
($515,500) of cash was used in financing activities during Fiscal 2022, compared to $1,377,224 of cash provided by financing activities during Fiscal 2021. During the Fiscal Years 2022 and 2021, the Company received net proceeds of $0 and $1,943,213 from borrowings, respectively and made principal payments of $494,626 and $275,628 on notes payable, respectively. The net proceeds of $1,943,213 received in Fiscal 2021 was for the new Chile monitoring center buildout.
Liquidity, Working Capital and Management’s Plan
As of September 30, 2022, the Company had unrestricted cash of $5,311,104, compared to unrestricted cash of $8,421,162 as of September 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2022, we had working capital of $7,296,297, compared to working capital of $9,190,430 as of September 30, 2021. This decrease in working capital of $1,894,133 is principally due to the purchase of monitoring equipment and parts as well as the settlement of the Sabag legal matter described in Item 3, partially offset by cash provided by operations.
On October 21, 2020, the Company requested, in writing, an additional extension to the maturity date of the Amended Facility Agreement. On November 25, 2020, the Noteholders held a meeting to address the Company’s request and approved a new maturity date of July 1, 2024. On December 21, 2020, Conrent and the Company signed an Amendment to the Amended Facility Agreement which extended the maturity date of the agreement to July 1, 2024, capitalized the accrued and unpaid interest which increased the outstanding principal amount and reduced the interest rate of the Amended Facility Agreement from 8% to 4%. On June 28, 2021, the Company restarted interest payments to Conrent which have been made semi-annually since that time. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
During Fiscal 2021, the Company borrowed approximately $1.95 million though six notes payable to fund the construction of monitoring centers in Chile required by our new contract. These six notes mature between January 2024 to February 2025 and the principal repayments on these six notes have all commenced. No additional funds were borrowed in Fiscal 2022. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Inflation
We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical operations or profitability prior to 2021; however, the rise in inflation experienced in 2021 and so far in 2022 have impacted the Company’s cost of labor and materials.
Off-Balance Sheet Financial Arrangements
The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the Company, except as described below.
Bond guarantees
As of September 30, 2022, Company has two performance bonds in connection with a foreign customer totaling $2,027,970 (collectively, the “Performance Bonds”) of which $1,449,497 is held in an interest-bearing account on behalf of the customer. The remaining amount of $578,473 is guaranteed by a foreign financial institution on behalf of the Company. The amounts held in cash on the Performance Bonds will be released approximately 90 days after the expiration of the Performance Bonds, as follows: $284,426 in calendar year 2023 and 1,165,071 in calendar year 2024. In March 2021, the Company has placed a $653,220 deposit into an interest-bearing account with a financial institution to replace the performance bond expiring on July 2, 2024, whereby the portion guaranteed by the financial institution will increase from 30% to 65% of the total bond. The current bond expiring July 2, 2024 will be released upon acceptance by the foreign customer. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Critical Accounting Policies
In Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report, we discuss those accounting policies we consider to be significant in determining the results of operations and our financial position.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, warranty obligations, product liability, revenue, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and other facts and circumstances that are believed to be reasonable, and the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities. The actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
With respect to revenue recognition, impairment of long-lived assets, leases, stock-based compensation and allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, we apply critical accounting policies discussed below in the preparation of our financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
Our revenue is predominantly derived from two sources: (i) monitoring services, and (ii) product sales.
Monitoring and Other Related Services
Monitoring services include two components: (i) lease contracts pursuant to which the Company provides monitoring services and leased devices to distributors or end users and the Company retains ownership of the leased device; and (ii) monitoring services purchased by distributors or end users who have previously purchased monitoring devices and opt to use the Company’s monitoring services. Monitoring revenue is recognized ratably over time, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of these services as they are performed. Payment due or received from the customers prior to rendering the associated services are recorded as deferred revenue.
Product Sales and Other
The Company sells devices and replacement parts to customers under certain contracts, as well as law enforcement software licenses and maintenance, and analytical software. Revenue from the sale of devices and parts is recognized upon their transfer of control to the customer, which is generally upon delivery. Delivery is considered complete at either the time of shipment or arrival at destination, based on the agreed upon terms within the contract. Payment terms are generally 30 days from invoice date. When purchasing products (such as ReliAlert™ and Shadow™ devices) from the Company, customers may, but are not required to, enter into monitoring service contracts with us. The Company recognizes revenue on monitoring services for customers that have previously purchased devices at the end of each month that monitoring services have been provided.
Multiple Element Arrangements
The majority of our revenue transactions do not have multiple elements. However, on occasion, the Company may enter into revenue transactions that have multiple elements. These may include different combinations of products or services that are included in a single billable rate. These products or services are delivered over time as the customer utilizes our services. In cases where obligations in a contract are distinct and thus require separation into multiple performance obligations, revenue recognition guidance requires that contract consideration be allocated to each distinct performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The value allocated to each performance obligation is then recognized as revenue when the revenue recognition criteria for each distinct promise or bundle of promises has been met.
Other Matters
The Company considers an arrangement with payment terms longer than the Company’s normal terms not to be fixed or determinable. Normal payment terms for the sale of monitoring services and products are due upon receipt to 30 days. The Company sells devices and services directly to end users and to distributors. Distributors do not have general rights of return. Also, distributors may not have price protection or stock protection rights with respect to devices sold to them by us. Generally, title and risk of loss pass to the buyer upon delivery of the devices.
Shipping and handling fees charged to customers are included as part of total revenue. The related freight costs and supplies directly associated with shipping products to customers are included as a component of cost of revenue. Our revenue is predominantly derived from two sources: (i) monitoring services, and (ii) product sales.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill
We review our long-lived assets including goodwill and intangibles for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of an asset may not be recoverable, and in the case of goodwill, at least annually. We evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate possible impairment as of each balance sheet date. We use an equity method of the related asset or group of assets in measuring whether the assets are recoverable. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its market value, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. Impairment of long-lived assets is assessed at the lowest levels for which there are an identifiable fair market value that is independent of other groups of assets. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We must make estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable. In doing so, we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer credit-worthiness, current macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or other standard setting bodies, which are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
We recognize compensation expense for stock-based awards expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award based on their grant date fair value. We estimate the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option pricing model which requires us to make estimates for certain assumptions regarding risk-free interest rate, expected life of options, expected volatility of stock, and expected dividend yield of stock.
Government Regulation
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws and regulations. We are not involved in any pending or, to our knowledge, threatened governmental proceedings, which would require curtailment of our operations because of such laws and regulations.
