Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs involving risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” or in other sections of this Annual Report.
OVERVIEW
Endeavor is a global sports and entertainment company. We own and operate premium sports properties, including the UFC, produce and distribute sports and entertainment content, own and manage exclusive live events and experiences, and represent top sports and entertainment talent, as well as blue chip corporate clients. Founded as a client representation business, we expanded organically and through strategic mergers and acquisitions, investing in new capabilities, including sports operations and advisory, events and experiences management, media production and distribution, brand licensing, and experiential marketing. The addition of these new capabilities and insights transformed our business into an integrated global platform anchored by owned and managed premium intellectual property.
Segments
We operate our business in three segments: (i) Owned Sports Properties; (ii) Events, Experiences & Rights; and (iii) Representation.
Owned Sports Properties
Our Owned Sports Properties segment is comprised of a unique portfolio of scarce sports properties, including UFC, PBR and Euroleague, that generate significant growth through innovative rights deals and exclusive live events.
Through the UFC, the world’s premier professional MMA organization, we produce more than 40 live events annually which are broadcast in over 160 countries and territories to approximately one billion TV households. UFC was founded in 1993 and has grown in popularity after hosting more than 500 events and reaching a global audience through an increasing array of broadcast license agreements and our owned FIGHT PASS streaming platform. The value of our content is demonstrated by our licensing arrangements with ESPN and other international broadcasters and our increasing consumer engagement is reflected by the growth of FIGHT PASS subscribers and overall follower growth and engagement across our social channels - now reaching 178 million followers.
PBR is the world’s premier bull riding circuit with more than 500 bull riders from the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, and Mexico, competing in more than 200 bull riding events each year pre-pandemic. PBR is one of America’s fastest growing sports with annual attendance for its premier series quadrupling since its inception in 1995.
We have an up to 20-year partnership with Euroleague basketball, which could extend into 2036, to manage and capitalize on all of the commercial business of the league, including media rights, sponsorship, content production, licensing, digital distribution, events staging, and hospitality, for which we receive a management fee.
At the end of 2021, we acquired six Professional Development League clubs affiliated with the Atlanta Braves, Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees and St. Louis Cardinals, whose results are included in Owned Sports Properties.
Events, Experiences & Rights
In our Events, Experiences & Rights segment, we own, operate, and provide services to a diverse portfolio of over 800 live events annually, including sporting events covering 20 sports across 25 countries, international fashion weeks, art fairs and music, culinary and lifestyle festivals. We own and operate many of these events, including the Miami Open, HSBC Champions, Frieze Art Fair, New York Fashion Week, and Hyde Park Winter Wonderland. We also operate other events on behalf of third parties, including the AIG Women’s British Open and Honda Classic. Through On Location, we provide premium experiences, historically providing more than 900 per year for sporting and music events such as the Super Bowl, Ryder Cup, NCAA Final Four and Coachella.
We are one of the largest independent global distributors of sports video programming and data. We sell media rights globally on behalf of more than 150 clients such as the IOC, the NFL, and the NHL, as well as for our owned assets and channels. We also provide league advisory services given the array of experience we have to offer. Through IMG ARENA, we work with more than 470 leading sportsbook brands worldwide to deliver live streaming video and data feeds for more than 45,000 sports events annually, as well as for on-demand virtual sports products including our own UFC Event Centre. We also leverage the technology derived from IMG ARENA to provide streaming video solutions to our clients and our owned assets via Endeavor Streaming.
Additionally, we own and operate IMG Academy, a leading academic and sports training institution located in Florida, as well as NCSA, which provides recruiting and admissions services to high school student athletes and college athletic departments and admissions officers.
In September 2021, we signed an agreement to acquire the OpenBet business of Scientific Games Corporation ("OpenBet"). OpenBet consists of companies that provide products and services to sports betting operators for the purposes of sports wagering. Based on the agreement, we will pay aggregate consideration to Scientific Games Corporation of $1.2 billion, consisting of cash of $1.0 billion, expected to be funded with cash on hand and 7,605,199 newly-issued shares of our Class A common stock with a value of $200 million based on the volume-weighted average trading price of the Class A common stock for the twenty trading days ended on September 24, 2021. The closing of this transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2022. Upon closing of the acquisition, we expect to create a new reportable segment that will include IMG ARENA and the OpenBet business.
In December 2021, we signed an agreement to acquire the Mutua Madrid Open tennis tournament and additional assets, including the Acciona Open de España golf tournament from Super Slam Ltd and its affiliates. Based on the agreement, we will pay approximately EUR 360 million for consideration and transfer fees upon closing, with an additional EUR 30 million of consideration payable within two years of closing. The closing of this transaction is subject to the final approvals of ATP Tour, Inc. and WTA Tour, Inc., and is expected to close in the first or second quarter of 2022.
Representation
Our Representation segment provides services to more than 7,000 talent and corporate clients and includes our content division, Endeavor Content. Our Representation business deploys a subset of our integrated capabilities on behalf of our clients.
Through our client representation and management businesses, including the WME talent agency and IMG Models, we represent a diverse group of talent across entertainment, sports, and fashion, including actors, directors, writers, athletes, models, musicians, and other artists, in a variety of mediums, such as film, television, books, and live events. Through our 160over90 business, we provide brand strategy, marketing, advertising, public relations, analytics, digital, activation, and experiential services to many of the world’s largest brands. Through IMG Licensing, we provide IP licensing services to a large portfolio of entertainment, sports, and consumer product brands, including representing these clients in the licensing of their logos, trade names and trademarks.
Endeavor Content provides a premium alternative to traditional content studios, offering a range of services including content development, production, financing, sales, and advisory services for creators. In February 2021, the Company signed a new franchise agreement and side letter (the “Franchise Agreements”) directly with the Writer’s Guild of America East and the Writer’s Guild of America West (collectively, the “WGA”). These Franchise Agreements include terms that, among other things, prohibit the Company from (a) negotiating packaging deals after June 30, 2022 and (b) having more than a 20% non-controlling ownership or other financial interest in, or being owned or affiliated with any individual or entity that has more than a 20% non-controlling ownership or other financial interest in, any entity or individual engaged in the production or distribution of works written by WGA members under a WGA collective bargaining agreement. As a result, in the third quarter, the Company began marketing the restricted Endeavor Content business for sale and such assets and liabilities are reflected as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. The sale of 80% of the restricted Endeavor Content business closed in January 2022. The remaining 20% interest will be reflected as an equity method investment beginning in the first quarter of 2022.
Components of Our Operating Results
Revenue
In our Owned Sports Properties segment, we primarily generate revenue via media rights fees, pay-per-view, sponsorships, ticket sales, subscriptions, and license fees. In our Events, Experiences & Rights segment, we primarily generate revenue from media rights sales, production service and studio fees, sponsorships, ticket and premium experience sales, subscriptions, streaming fees, tuition, profit sharing, and commissions. In our Representation segment, we generate revenue primarily through commissions, packaging fees, marketing and consulting fees, production fees, and content licensing fees.
Direct Operating Costs
Our direct operating costs primarily include third-party expenses associated with the production of events and experiences, content production costs, operation of our training and education facilities, and fees for media rights, including required payments related to sales agency contracts when minimum sales guarantees are not met.
Selling, General and Administrative
Our selling, general and administrative expenses primarily include personnel costs as well as rent, professional service costs and other overhead required to support our operations and corporate structure.
Provision for Income Taxes
EGH was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in January 2019. It was formed as a holding company for the purpose of completing an IPO and other related transactions. As the sole managing member of Endeavor Manager, which is the sole managing member of EOC, EGH operates and controls all the business and affairs of EOC, and through EOC and its subsidiaries, conducts the Company’s business. EGH is subject to corporate income tax on its share of taxable income or loss of EOC, derived from Endeavor Manager. EOC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is therefore not subject to U.S. corporate income tax. However, certain of EOC’s subsidiaries are subject to U.S. or foreign corporate income tax.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly changed market and economic conditions globally, including significantly impacting the entertainment and sports industries as well as our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in various governmental restrictions and began to have a significant adverse impact on our business and operations beginning in March 2020, including the lack of ticketed PBR and UFC events and the early cancellation of the 2019-2020 Euroleague season adversely impacting our Owned Sports Properties segment; the postponement or cancellation of live sporting events and other in-person events adversely impacting our Events, Experiences & Rights segment; and stoppages of entertainment productions, including film, television shows
and music events, as well as reduced corporate spending on marketing, experiential and activation, adversely impacting our Representation segment. Furthermore, following the merger of our IMG College business with Learfield, the operating results of the merged business had been weaker than anticipated driven by lower than expected sales and have been further impacted in 2020 by COVID-19 as a result of the delay, cancellation of or shortened college football season and the prohibition of fans by many teams, which resulted in impairment charges at Learfield IMG College in 2020 adversely impacting our equity earnings. In 2020, we also recognized goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges primarily at our Events, Experiences & Rights segment, driven by lower projections as a result of the impact of COVID-19 and restructuring in certain of our businesses. In the future, any further impact to our business as a result of COVID-19 could result in additional impairments of goodwill, intangibles, long-term investments and long-lived assets.
While activity has resumed in all of our businesses and restrictions have been lessened or lifted, restrictions could in the future be increased or reinstated. As a result of this and numerous other uncertainties surrounding the pandemic and the risk that additional postponements or cancellations of live sporting events and other in-person events, and changes in consumer preferences towards our business and the industries in which we operate could occur, we are unable to accurately predict the full impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows, but acknowledge that its impact on our business and results of operations may be material. We expect that recovery will continue and that the wider impact on revenue and cash flows will vary, but will generally depend on the factors listed above and the general uncertainty surrounding COVID-19.
UFC Buyout
Substantially simultaneous with the closing of the IPO, we consummated the UFC Buyout whereby we acquired equity interests in UFC Parent (including warrants of UFC Parent) from the Other UFC Holders (or their affiliates) resulting in Endeavor Operating Company directly or indirectly owning 100% of the equity interests of UFC Parent.
As a result of the UFC Buyout, we no longer attribute income (loss) to non-controlling interests related to UFC in our consolidated statement of operations and recognized a reduction in nonredeemable non-controlling interests on our consolidated balance sheet. Furthermore, restrictions on dividends under the UFC LLC Agreement are no longer in place after the UFC Buyout, although restrictions from the UFC Credit Facilities remain in place.
Reorganization
Prior to the closing of the IPO on May 3, 2021, we undertook reorganization transactions, following which Endeavor Group Holdings became a holding company, and its principal asset is an equity interest in a newly formed subsidiary of Endeavor Group Holdings, Endeavor Manager, of which Endeavor Group Holdings serves as the managing member. Endeavor Manager is in turn the managing member of Endeavor Operating Company. Endeavor Group Holdings manages and operates the business and controls the strategic decisions and day-to-day operations of Endeavor Manager as its sole managing member, and Endeavor Operating Company as its indirect sole managing member, and also has a substantial financial interest in Endeavor Manager and, indirectly, Endeavor Operating Company. Accordingly, Endeavor Group Holdings consolidates the results of operations of Endeavor Manager and Endeavor Operating Company, and a portion of Endeavor Group Holding’s net income (loss) is allocated to non-controlling interests to reflect the entitlements of certain former members of Endeavor Operating Company who retain ownership interests in Endeavor Manager and Endeavor Operating Company.
After consummation of the IPO and the reorganization transactions, we became subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any taxable income of Endeavor Manager and Endeavor Operating Company, and we are taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates. Endeavor Operating Company makes distributions to us in an amount sufficient to allow us to pay our tax obligations and operating expenses, including distributions to fund any ordinary course payments due under the tax receivable agreements. The Company entered into the tax receivable agreements with certain persons that held direct or indirect interests in EOC and UFC Parent prior to the IPO. The tax receivable agreements generally provide for the payment by EGH of 85% of the amount of any tax benefits that EGH actually realizes as further described below under "Liquidity and Capital Resources-Future sources and uses of liquidity-Tax receivable agreements".
In addition, we have implemented and will continue to implement additional procedures and processes for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public companies. We expect to continue to incur expenses related to these steps and, among other things, additional directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, director fees, reporting requirements of the SEC, transfer agent fees, hiring additional accounting, legal and administrative personnel, increased auditing and legal fees and similar expenses. We have recognized and will continue to recognize certain non-recurring costs as part of our transition to a publicly traded company, consisting of professional fees and other expenses.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. This information is derived from our accompanying consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Revenue
Revenue increased $1,599.0 million, or 46.0%, to $5,077.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 as the Company rebounds from the impact of COVID-19.
•Owned Sports Properties increased by $155.6 million, or 16.3%. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in media rights fees, new sponsorship deals and event related revenue due to the increase in the number of events held at UFC, an increase in PBR events and the successful completion of the Euroleague season in 2021 partially offset by a $25 million contract termination fee recognized in the prior year.
•Events, Experiences & Rights increased by $437.8 million, or 27.5%. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in media rights fees of $139 million primarily driven by the return of live events and the impact of COVID-19 on the European soccer seasons partially offset by the expiration of two European soccer contracts in the second quarter of 2021. Additionally, sports production revenue increased $87 million and event and performance revenue increased $212 million due to the return of live events in 2021. Events and performance revenue also benefited from the acquisition of NCSA.
•Representation increased by $1,015.9 million, or 107.6%. The increase was primarily driven by a $716 million increase in content deliveries at Endeavor Content and an increase of $300 million in client commissions, licensing and corporate spending on marketing and experiential activations as the prior year was significantly impacted by COVID-19.
Revenue decreased $1,092.2 million, or 23.9%, to $3,478.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 (excluding the impact of On Location, revenue decreased 30.2% in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019).
•Owned Sports Properties increased by $16.9 million, or 1.8%. The increase in our Owned Sports Properties segment was driven by increased rights fees at UFC of $20.0 million, in addition to a $25 million increase from a contract termination fee, partially offset by the lower number of events as well as the lack of ticket sales for UFC and PBR events and the early cancellation of the Euroleague season from the impact of COVID-19.
•Events, Experiences & Rights decreased by $390.7 million, or 19.7%. The decline was primarily attributable to COVID-19 related impacts which resulted in the postponement or cancellation of live sporting events and other in-person events starting in mid-March and was partially offset by $289.5 million related to the acquisition of On Location.
•Representation decreased by $729.9 million, or 43.6%. The decline was primarily driven by the impact of COVID-19 on talent and brand representation due to the stoppages of entertainment productions, including film, television shows, and music events, as well as reduced corporate spending on marketing and activation starting in mid-March.
Direct operating costs
Direct operating costs increased $851.9 million, or 48.8%, to $2,597.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $656 million related to an increase in content deliveries at Endeavor Content, $111 million related to events and performance, $69 million in media production, and $22 million in marketing and experiential activation costs due to the changes in revenue described above.
Direct operating costs decreased $578.0 million, or 24.9%, to $1,745.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to approximately $541 million of reduced event costs, media rights expenses and sports production costs resulting from the postponement or cancellation of sports and live events due to COVID-19 and approximately $222 million of lower content amortization expenses due to a reduction in content delivery in 2020, partially offset by approximately $234 million of increases in costs related to On Location acquired in January 2020.
Selling, general and administrative expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $841.2 million, or 58.3%, to $2,283.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was principally due to increased equity-based compensation expense of $441 million, of which $251.9 million is due to modifications of certain pre-IPO awards to remove certain forfeiture and discretionary call terms, higher cost of personnel, including bonuses, and other operating expenses as the business recovers from the impact of COVID-19.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $311.6 million, or 17.8%, to $1,442.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease principally reflects our COVID-19 related cost savings initiatives including lower cost of personnel resulting from pay reductions, furloughs and workforce reductions, and reduced travel and other operating expenses. This decrease was partially offset by $56.9 million of selling, general and administrative costs associated with On Location.
Insurance recoveries
We maintain events cancellation insurance policies for a significant number of our events. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $68.2 million and $87.0 million, of insurance recoveries, respectively, which primarily related to cancelled events in our Events, Experiences & Rights and Owned Sports Properties segments due to COVID-19.
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization decreased $28.0 million, or 9.0%, to $282.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The decreases were primarily driven by certain UFC intangible assets becoming fully amortized in 2020 offset by increases for our 2021 acquisitions.
Depreciation and amortization increased $30.1 million, or 10.7%, to $310.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the amortization of intangible assets recognized in connection with our 2020 acquisitions of On Location and the remaining 50% of the membership interests of FC Diez Media.
Impairment charges
Impairment charges of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 related to goodwill in our Events, Experiences & Rights and Representation segments. Impairment charges of $220.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to goodwill and intangible asset impairment driven by lower projections as a result of the impact of COVID-19 and restructuring in certain of our businesses, primarily in our Events, Experiences & Rights and Representation segments.
Interest expense, net
Interest expense, net decreased $15.9 million, or 5.6% to $268.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, principally due to lower interest rates under our UFC Credit Facility following a repricing in January 2021 partially offset by higher indebtedness.
Loss on extinguishment of debt of $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 was due to fees and expenses incurred for the early redemption of our term loans issued in May 2020.
Interest expense, net increased $13.6 million to $284.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, principally due to lower short-term rates, partially offset by higher indebtedness incurred through additional borrowings.
Tax receivable agreements liability adjustment
The Company recorded a $92.6 million expense for the tax receivable agreements liability related to the expected realization of certain tax benefits, including the release of a valuation allowance, in connection with the sale of the restricted Endeavor Content business, which closed in
January 2022, and recorded a $9.1 million expense due to a change in estimates related to the tax receivable agreements liability recorded in the second quarter of 2021.
Other income (expense), net
The income for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily included $22.2 million of gains primarily from sales and changes in fair value of equity investments partially offset by $17.2 million of foreign currency transaction losses and $11.3 million of losses due to the change in the fair value of embedded foreign currency derivatives.
The income for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily included gains of $27.1 million, $8.1 million, $15.3 million and $12.7 million recorded for the acquisition of the remaining 50% of the membership interests of FC Diez Media, the deconsolidation of Asian Tour Media, the gain on the sale of an investment and the change in the fair value of embedded foreign currency derivatives, respectively.
The expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily included a $27.4 million impairment of equity investments and related note receivable and a $39.3 million loss related to the change in the fair value of embedded foreign currency derivatives.
(Benefit from) provision for income taxes
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded $22.3 million benefit from income taxes compared to $8.5 million provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change is primarily due to the impact of a $68.6 million valuation allowance release related to the expected realization of certain tax benefits in connection with the sale of the restricted Endeavor Content business, which closed in January 2022, partially offset by deferred tax liabilities associated with indefinite lived intangibles recorded as a result of the IPO and a change in the tax rate in the United Kingdom.
The provision for income taxes increased $5.1 million to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. The change is primarily due to tax expense of $24.1 million related to the On Location acquisition and subsequent tax restructuring, $10.2 million to revise the tax provision related to a prior year acquisition and subsequent tax restructuring, offset by a $7.2 million decrease in unrecognized tax benefits, and the release of $19.1 million of valuation allowances on net deferred U.S. tax assets, exclusive of deferred tax liabilities on indefinite lived intangible assets, state income taxes, and foreign tax credits.
Equity losses of affiliates, net of tax
Equity losses of affiliates decreased $187.4 million to $72.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 and decreased $132.6 million to $260.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Our equity losses of affiliates are primarily due to the losses related to our investment in Learfield IMG College. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded $76.1 million of such equity losses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $250.7 million in equity losses resulting from continued losses and the impact of COVID-19 on Learfield IMG College's operating results, resulting in goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments. During the year December 31, 2019, Learfield IMG College's results included a charge as a result of its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test. Additionally, during the year December 31, 2019, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $117.0 million resulting from continued losses and limited expectations of recovery.
Net (loss) income attributable to non-controlling interests
Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests was $139.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to net income attributable to non-controlling interests of $29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change from income to loss was primarily driven by the effect of the reorganization transactions offset by net income incurred at UFC prior to the UFC Buyout.
Net income attributable to non-controlling interests increased $6.5 million to $29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in net income from UFC offset by the net loss allocated to the non-controlling interest holders from the acquisition of On Location.
SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
We classify our business into three reportable segments: Owned Sports Properties; Events, Experiences & Rights; and Representation. Our chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of our segments based on segment Revenue and segment Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes segment Adjusted EBITDA is indicative of operational performance and ongoing profitability and is used to evaluate the operating performance of our segments and for planning and forecasting purposes, including the allocation of resources and capital.
Segment operating results reflect earnings before corporate and unallocated shared expenses. Segment operating results include allocations of certain costs, including facilities, technology, and other shared services costs, which are allocated based on metrics designed to correlate with consumption. These allocations are agreed-upon amounts between the businesses and may differ from amounts that would be negotiated in arm’s length transactions.
The following tables display Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:
Owned Sports Properties
The following table sets forth our Owned Sports Properties segment results for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:
Year ended December 31, 2021 compared to year ended December 31, 2020
Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $155.6 million, or 16.3%, to $1,108.2 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily related to an increase in media rights fees of $88 million and event related revenue of $68 million due to an increase in the number of events held at UFC and PBR, increased sponsorships and the successful completion of the Euroleague season in 2021. The event related revenue in the prior year includes a $25 million contract termination fee.
Direct operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $66.8 million, or 21.3%, to $379.7 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of UFC events held.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $8.4 million, or 4.5%, to $194.2 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to cost of personnel as well as travel expenses related to the increase in the number of UFC events held. Corporate allocations remained relatively unchanged in 2021 from 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $80.0 million, or 17.5%, to $537.6 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by the increase in revenue partially offset by the increase in direct operating costs and selling, general and administrative expenses.
Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019
Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $16.9 million, or 1.8%, to $952.6 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was driven by increased rights fees at UFC of $20.0 million, in addition to a $25 million increase from a contract termination fee, partially offset by the impacts from COVID-19 as UFC and PBR had fewer events and events that occurred had limited to no ticket revenue from April through September, and the cancellation of the 2019-2020 Euroleague season in March.
Direct operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $19.5 million, or 5.9%, to $312.9 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was attributable to reduced event costs at UFC by holding certain events at the UFC APEX facilities during 2020 and a reduction in the number of events at PBR in 2020.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $5.7 million, or 3.2%, to $185.8 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to higher cost of personnel of approximately $10 million partially offset by cost savings initiatives in other operating expenses. Corporate allocations remained relatively unchanged in 2020 from 2019.
Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $40.4 million, or 9.7%, to $457.6 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to increased revenue at UFC as well as decreased direct operating costs, partially offset by declines in PBR and Euroleague due to the COVID-19 related impacts described above.
Events, Experiences & Rights
The following table sets forth our Events, Experiences & Rights segment results for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:
Year ended December 31, 2021 compared to year ended December 31, 2020
Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $437.8 million, or 27.5%, to $2,031.3 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
•Media rights fees increased $139 million primarily driven by the impact of COVID-19 cancelling and delaying live events in 2020 such as UEFA Euros, The Open Championship and Wimbledon and the timing of matches on both the 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 European soccer seasons as well as new events such as CONCACAF partially offset by the expiration of two European soccer contracts in the second quarter of 2021.
•Media Production revenue increased $87 million due to the return to a largely full schedule of events in 2021 as compared to the impact of COVID-19 on event schedules in 2020, including coverage of the English Premier League which was partially rescheduled to the second half of 2020, and golf and tennis events which were cancelled.
•Event and performance revenue increased $212 million due primarily to (i) the adverse impact of COVID-19 on certain events in the prior year, including Hyde Park Winter Wonderland, Miami Open, Ryder Cup, HSBC Women’s World Championship, Honda LPGA, ANA Inspiration, Frieze NY and Miss Universe pageant, (ii) all summer camps taking place at the IMG Academy at full capacity in 2021 that were cancelled or had attendance restrictions in 2020 and (iii) the benefit of the NCSA acquisition. These increases were partially offset by attendance restrictions at the 2021 Super Bowl LV, as well as the adverse impact of COVID-19 on certain events in the current year, including Frieze LA and Rio Open, and the exit of our Exhibitions business.
Direct operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $123.5 million, or 9.9%, to $1,370.3 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Media production expenses increased $69 million due to changes in revenue described above and live event and performance costs of $50 million due to the changes in revenue described above, including amounts for the cancellation of an event and the impact of the acquisition of NCSA. These increases were partially offset by decreases in media rights expenses due to the expiration of two European soccer contracts described above, whose costs were in excess of revenue, offset by increases resulting from the return of live events and new events.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $127.1 million, or 32.8%, to $514.3 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by increased cost of personnel as the business recovers from the impact of COVID-19. The acquisition of NCSA contributed approximately $55 million in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021. Corporate allocations remained relatively unchanged in 2021 from 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $156.4 million to $215.6 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by the increase in revenue partially offset by the increase in related direct operating costs and selling, general and administrative expenses and a decrease in insurance recoveries related to cancelled events.
Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019
Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $390.7 million, or 19.7%, to $1,593.5 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Revenue decreased $680.2 million primarily from our media rights and live event revenues attributable to COVID-19 related event cancellations or delays, partially offset by $289.5 million related to the acquisition of On Location in January 2020. Revenue declined due to the delay of the soccer season in Europe which resulted in modified schedules for most leagues, as well as the cancellation or delay of major tennis and golf events which negatively impacted our media rights and sports production revenues. Events revenue declined due to the cancellations of the Miami Open and Hyde Park Winter Wonderland as well as other cancelled or postponed events, motorsports and exhibitions. Excluding the impact of the On Location acquisition, revenue decreased 34.3% for 2020 compared to 2019.
Direct operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $214.7 million, or 14.7%, to $1,246.8 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Direct operating expenses decreased $445.1 million primarily from a reduction in media rights expenses of $137.3 million and live event costs of $284.3 million due to COVID-19 related event cancellations or delays, partially offset by $230.4 million of direct operating expenses from On Location.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $0.8 million, or 0.2%, to $387.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $57.7 million primarily from our cost savings initiatives implemented across the segment, which focused on cost of personnel, travel and other operating expenses as a result of
COVID-19; such decrease was primarily offset by selling, general and administrative expenses from On Location of $56.9 million. Corporate allocations remained relatively unchanged in 2020 from 2019.
Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $87.7 million, or 59.7%, to $59.2 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to declines in revenue and related direct operating expenses as noted above and was partially offset by On Location and the benefit from the cost savings initiatives implemented across the segment, as well as insurance recoveries related to certain events of $81.4 million.
Representation
The following table sets forth our Representation segment results for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:
Year ended December 31, 2021 compared to year ended December 31, 2020
Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $1,015.9 million, or 107.6%, to $1,959.8 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to a $716 million increase in content deliveries at Endeavor Content and an increase of $300 million in client commissions, licensing and marketing and experiential activations which were all significantly impacted by COVID-19 in the prior year.
Direct operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $677.2 million, or 355.9%, to $867.4 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was predominantly attributable to the above mentioned increase in content deliveries at Endeavor Content and marketing and experiential activations.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $166.2 million, or 30.6%, to $710.0 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by growth in cost of personnel, including bonuses, as the business recovers from the impact of COVID-19. Corporate allocations remained relatively unchanged in 2021 from 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $171.4 million, or 80.9%, to $383.4 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by the increase in revenue partially offset by the increase in direct operating costs and selling, general and administrative expenses.
Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019
Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $729.9 million, or 43.6%, to $943.9 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to the impact of COVID-19 on talent and brand representation due to stoppages of entertainment productions, including film, television shows, and music events, disruption of Endeavor Content film and television projects, as well as reduced corporate spending on marketing and activation.
Direct operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $360.3 million, or 65.4%, to $190.3 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decline is primarily due to lower content amortization expenses of approximately $222 million due to a reduction in content delivery in 2020 and approximately $93 million due to the reduction of experiential marketing activations.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $200.6 million, or 26.9%, to $543.8 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decline was primarily related to cost savings initiatives across the segment focused on cost of personnel, travel and operating expenses in response to COVID-19. Corporate allocations remained relatively unchanged in 2020 from 2019.
Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $163.1 million, or 43.5%, to $212.0 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to declines in revenue and related direct operating expenses as noted above, which were partially offset by cost savings initiatives.
Corporate
Corporate primarily consists of overhead, personnel costs, and costs associated with corporate initiatives that are not fully allocated to the operating divisions. Such expenses include compensation and other benefits for corporate office employees, rent, professional fees related to internal control compliance and monitoring, financial statement audits and legal, information technology and insurance that is managed through our corporate office.
The following table sets forth our results for Corporate for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019
Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased $111.0 million, or 76.5%, to $(256.3) million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The decline was driven by an increase in cost of personnel, including bonuses, and other general and administrative expenses.
Adjusted EBITDA improved $60.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $(145.2) million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in expenses was primarily due to lower cost of personnel, travel, and professional fees associated with a cost reduction effort which began in March 2020 in response to COVID-19.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net income (loss), excluding income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, merger, acquisition and earn-out costs, certain legal costs, restructuring, severance and impairment charges, certain non-cash fair value adjustments, certain equity earnings, COVID-19 related expenses, tax receivable agreements liability adjustment, and certain other items when applicable. Adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Revenue.
Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors as it eliminates the significant level of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from our capital investments and intangible assets recognized in business combinations, and improves comparability by eliminating the significant level of interest expense associated with our debt facilities, as well as income taxes, which may not be comparable with other companies based on our tax structure.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are used as the primary bases to evaluate our consolidated operating performance.
Adjusted Net Income is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Endeavor Group Holdings adjusted to exclude our share (excluding those relating to certain non-controlling interests) of the adjustments used to calculate Adjusted EBITDA, other than income taxes, net interest expense and depreciation, on an after tax basis, the release of tax valuation allowances and other tax items.
Adjusted Net Income adjusts income or loss attributable to the Company for items that are not considered to be reflective of our operating performance. Management believes that such non-GAAP information is useful to investors and analysts as it provides a better understanding of the performance of our operations for the periods presented and, accordingly, facilitates the development of future projections and earnings growth prospects.
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Adjusted Net Income have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:
•they do not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments;
•Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt;
•although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or require improvements in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Adjusted Net Income do not reflect any cash requirement for such replacements or improvements; and
•they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows.
We compensate for these limitations by using Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Net Income along with other comparative tools, together with GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance.
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Net Income should not be considered substitutes for the reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net (loss) income as indicators of our financial performance, as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. Although we use Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Net Income as financial measures to assess the performance of our business, such use is limited because it does not include certain material costs necessary to operate our business. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Net Income should not be construed as indications that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. These non-GAAP financial measures, as determined and presented by us, may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Set forth below are reconciliations of our most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP to these non-GAAP financial measures on a consolidated basis.

Other debt
As of December 31, 2021, we had certain other revolving line of credit facilities and long-term debt liabilities, primarily related to Endeavor Content and On Location, with total committed amounts of $528.7 million, of which $252 million was outstanding and $76.2 million was available for borrowing based on the supporting asset base. Such facilities have maturity dates in 2023 and 2025, bearing interest at rates ranging from 2.63% to 2.87%.

As of December 31, 2021, our Endeavor Content facility had total capacity of $430.0 million, and we had $223.4 million borrowed and a letter of credit outstanding of $1.2 million. Our ability to borrow under the facility depends on there being sufficient borrowing base capacity, which in turn depends on the number and size of productions we are engaged in and the value of future receipts for the productions. The amounts borrowed under the facility will increase if we enter into additional productions, or decrease if we reduce our production activity. The Endeavor Content facility matures on March 31, 2025. The outstanding borrowings under this facility have been classified within liabilities held for sale as of December 31, 2021.

As of December 31, 2021, we had no borrowings outstanding under the OL Credit Facility and no letters of credit outstanding. The OL Credit Facility matures on the earlier of August 2026 or the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the term loans under the Credit Facilities.
Both the Endeavor Content Facility and the OL Credit Facility contain restrictions that are substantially similar to those in the Credit Facilities and the UFC Credit Facilities.
Cash Flows Overview
Years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019
December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020
Operating activities changed from $161.2 million of cash provided in the year ended December 31, 2020 to $333.6 million of cash provided in the year ended December 31, 2021. Cash provided in the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily represents a smaller net loss of $467.5 million from the continued recovery from COVID-19, higher amortization of content costs of $584.9 million from content deliveries at Endeavor Content and an increase in equity-based compensation expense of $532.5 million partially offset by an increase in other assets of $800.9 million from additional investments in Endeavor Content film assets and an increase in accounts receivable of $351.6 million. Cash provided in the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily represents a decrease in accounts receivable of $314.0 million and equity losses from affiliates of $260.1 million due to changes to the timing of collections and payments from modified event and media rights schedules and the adverse impact on businesses from COVID-19.
Investing activities changed from $315.8 million of cash used in the year ended December 31, 2020 to $659.1 million of cash used in the year ended December 31, 2021. Cash used in the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily reflects payments for acquisitions of businesses, primarily for NCSA, DBH, FlightScope and Mailman, of $436.4 million, investments in non-controlled affiliates, primarily Learfield IMG College, of $154.1 million and capital expenditures of $99.8 million. Cash used in the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily reflects payments for acquisitions of businesses, primarily On Location, of $317.9 million, capital expenditures of $71.7 million and investments in non-controlled affiliates of $37.6 million offset by proceeds received of $113.0 million primarily for the sale of an investment.
Financing activities changed from $454.0 million of cash provided in the year ended December 31, 2020 to $960.2 million of cash provided in the year ended December 31, 2021. Cash provided in the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily reflects proceeds from the equity offerings, net of underwriting discounts, primarily from the IPO and private placements, of $1,886.6 million partially offset by $835.7 million used for the UFC Buyout. Cash provided in the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily reflects net proceeds from debt of $649.5 million partially offset by distributions of $123.2 million primarily made by UFC.
December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019
Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $236.7 million primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 on our results of operations. Operating cash flow was adversely impacted as television and film productions were put on hiatus, while concerts and live event marketing programs were cancelled, reducing the commissions and fees earned in 2020, the cancellation of live events, restrictions on live attendance, and reduced enrollment in our full-time and camp programs. This was partially offset by event cancellation insurance proceeds and cost reduction initiatives, implemented in March 2020 that reduced cash compensation, travel & entertainment, and other operating expenses.
Investing activities from continuing operations changed from $46.1 million of cash provided in the year ended December 31, 2019 to $315.8 million of cash used in the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in cash used for investing is primarily due to higher payments for acquisitions of businesses, primarily On Location, of $317.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and lower amounts of proceeds received for the sale of our investments.
Financing activities from continuing operations changed from $428.1 million of cash used in the year ended December 31, 2019 to $454.0 million of cash provided in the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash provided in the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily reflects net proceeds from debt of $649.5 million offset by distributions of $123.2 million primarily made by UFC. Cash used in the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily reflects $537.7 million for the redemption of all Zuffa’s Class P Units, $512.7 million for the redemption of certain of our equity interests, and $165.0 million related to payments under our equity buyback plan and tax distributions to equity investors, partially offset by contributions of $470.6 million from our equity investors and net proceeds from debt of $391.3 million.
Future sources and uses of liquidity
Our sources of liquidity are (1) cash on hand, (2) cash flows from operations, (3) available borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities (which borrowings would be subject to certain restrictive covenants contained therein) and (4) proceeds from the sale of the restricted Endeavor Content business. Based on our current expectations, we believe that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements and to meet our commitments, including long-term debt service for at least the next 12 months. However, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have an impact on cash flows from operations in the future.
Our cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks and liquid investments in money market funds. As of December 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,561.0 million, including cash held at non-wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries where cash distributions may be subject to restriction under applicable operating agreements or debt agreements and, due to such restrictions, may not be readily available to service obligations outside of those subsidiaries. These balances, which primarily consist of Endeavor China and On Location were $123.7 million as of December 31, 2021.
We expect that our primary liquidity needs will be cash to (1) provide capital to facilitate organic growth of our business, (2) fund future investments, acquisitions (including OpenBet and Madrid Open) and settle acquisition earn-outs from prior acquisitions, (3) pay operating expenses, including cash compensation to our employees, (4) fund capital expenditures, (5) pay interest and principal when due on our Senior Credit Facilities, (6) make payments under the tax receivable agreements, (7) pay income taxes, (8) make distributions to members and (9) reduce our outstanding indebtedness under our Senior Credit Facilities.
We expect to refinance the Senior Credit Facilities prior to the maturity of the outstanding loans, with the first maturity for outstanding term loans under the Senior Credit Facilities occurring in 2025. We currently anticipate being able to secure funding for such refinancing at favorable terms, however our ability to do so may be impacted by many factors, including our growth and other factors specific to our business as well as macro- economic factors beyond our control, including as a result of COVID-19.
Tax distributions by Endeavor Operating Company
Other than as described below, we expect to retain all our future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.
Subject to funds being legally available, we expect that Endeavor Operating Company will make distributions to each of its members, including the Endeavor Profits Units holders and Endeavor Manager, in amounts sufficient to pay applicable taxes attributable to each member’s allocable share of taxable income of Endeavor Operating Company. Tax distributions made in respect of Endeavor Operating Company Units (but not Endeavor Profits Units) will generally be made pro rata in respect of such Units, as described in the Endeavor Operating Company LLC Agreement. However, in certain situations, tax distributions made to Endeavor Manager may be reduced (relative to those tax distributions made to the other members of Endeavor Operating Company) to reflect the income tax rates to which Endeavor Manager and Endeavor Group Holdings are subject and certain other factors. Non pro-rata tax distributions may be paid to holders of Endeavor Profits Units.
Tax receivable agreements
Generally, we are required under the tax receivable agreements to make payments to certain persons that held direct or indirect interest in EOC and UFC Parent prior to the IPO ("TRA Holders") that are generally equal to 85% of the applicable cash tax savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that we realize or are deemed to realize (determined by using certain assumptions) as a result of favorable tax attributes that will be available to us as a result of certain transactions contemplated in connection with our IPO, exchanges of Endeavor Operating Company Units for Class A common stock or cash and payments made under the tax receivable agreements. We will generally be entitled to retain the remaining 15% of these cash tax savings. Payments will be due only after we have filed our U.S. federal and state income tax returns. Payments under the tax receivable agreements will bear interest from the due date of the tax return reflecting the applicable tax benefits. We currently expect to fund these payments from cash flows from operations generated by our subsidiaries as well as from excess tax distributions that we receive from our subsidiaries. The amounts payable under the tax receivable agreements will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the amount, character and timing of the taxable income of EGH in the future. If the existing valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax assets applicable to the tax attributes referenced above is released in a future period as a result of having sufficient taxable income, among other criteria, or other tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreements are determined to be payable, additional tax receivable agreements liabilities may be recorded. In the event that such criteria are met in 2022, the associated tax receivable agreements liability to be recorded for all exchanges that have occurred as of December 31, 2021, would exceed $850 million.
Under the tax receivable agreements, as a result of certain types of transactions or occurrences, including a transaction resulting in a change of control or a material breach of our obligations under the tax receivable agreements, we may also be required to make payments to the TRA Holders in amounts equal to the present value of future payments we are obligated to make under the tax receivable agreements. If the payments under the tax receivable agreements are accelerated, we may be required to raise additional debt or equity to fund such payments. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the tax receivable agreements as a result of having insufficient funds (including because our credit agreements restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us) such payments will generally be deferred and will accrue interest until paid.
Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies
The following table represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021, aggregated by type.
(1)	The principal balance of certain term loans is repaid on a quarterly basis at an amortization rate of 0.25% per quarter, with the balance due at maturity. See Note 12, “Debt,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further detail.
(2)	Variable interest rate payments on our long-term debt are calculated based on the current interest rate as of December 31, 2021 and the scheduled maturity of the underlying loans. Interest payments also include a commitment fee of 0.50% that we are required to pay on the unused balance of our revolving credit facilities under the Senior Credit Facilities.
(3)	Our operating leases are primarily for office facilities, equipment and vehicles. Certain of these leases contain provisions for rent escalations or lease concessions.
(4)	We routinely enter into purchase or guarantee arrangements for media, event or other representation rights as well as for advancements for content production or overhead costs with various organizations.
Payment obligations due under the tax receivable agreements as of December 31, 2021 total $133.8 million, of which $41.2 million is expected to be paid in 2022 and $92.6 million is expected to be paid in 2023. Future additional payments we may be required to make under the tax receivable agreements may be significant and are dependent upon certain criteria being met including future taxable income. See “Tax receivable agreements" above and see Part III, Item 13. "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Tax Receivable Agreements."
In September 2021, we signed an agreement to acquire the OpenBet business of Scientific Games Corporation ("OpenBet"). OpenBet consists of companies that provide products and services to sports betting operators for the purposes of sports wagering. Based on the agreement, we will pay Scientific Games Corporation consideration of $1.0 billion in cash and will issue 7,605,199 shares of the Company's Class A common stock, a value of $200.0 million based on the volume-weighted average trading price of the Class A common stock for the twenty trading days ended on September 24, 2021. The closing of this transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2022.
In December 2021, we signed an agreement to acquire the Mutua Madrid Open tennis tournament and additional assets, including the Acciona Open de España golf tournament from Super Slam Ltd and its affiliates. Based on the agreement, we will pay approximately EUR 360 million for consideration and transfer fees upon closing, with an additional EUR 30 million of consideration payable within two years of closing. The closing of this transaction is subject to the final approvals of ATP Tour, Inc. and WTA Tour, Inc., and is expected to close in the first or second quarter of 2022.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make assumptions, estimates or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates or judgments, however, are both subjective and subject to change, and actual results may differ from our assumptions and estimates.
We believe the following estimates related to certain of our critical accounting policies, could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments. See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies.
Revenue Recognition
We have revenue recognition policies for our various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business.
In accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the Company’s customers either at a point in time or over time, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASC 606 requires additional disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and estimates, and changes in those estimates. For further information regarding the impact of the adoption of this standard refer to Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 18, “Revenue” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations
We have various types of contracts with multiple performance obligations, primarily consisting of multi-year sponsorship and media rights agreements. The transaction price in these types of contracts is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis. We typically determine the standalone selling price of individual performance obligations based on management estimates, unless standalone selling prices are observable through past transactions. Estimates used to determine a performance obligation’s standalone selling price impact the amount and timing of revenue recognized, but not the total amount of revenue to be recognized under the arrangement.
Principal versus Agent
We enter into many arrangements that require management to determine whether we are acting as a principal or an agent. This determination involves judgment and requires evaluation as to whether the Company controls the goods or services before they are transferred to the customer. As part of this analysis, the Company considers whether we are primarily responsible for fulfillment of the promise to provide the specified service, have inventory risk and have discretion in establishing prices. For events, this determination is primarily based on whether an event is owned by us or whether we are providing an event management service. For media rights distribution, this determination is primarily based on whether we have control over the media rights including inventory risk and setting pricing with customers. For re-billable expenses related to advertising and brand activation services, this determination is primarily based on whether we are primarily responsible for fulfillment of the services to the customer. If our determinations were to change, the amounts of our revenue and operating expenses may be different.
Timing of Recognition
Commission-based Representation and Licensing Revenue
For arrangements where we earn commissions or royalties based on a client’s sales, earnings or back-end profits, we recognize revenue either over time or at the point in time that our client performs in accordance with the terms of their engagement. We earn packaging revenue directly from studios/production companies (in lieu of receiving a commission from a client) for our role in arranging the creation, development and/or production of a program to be exhibited on broadcast or cable television, streaming, video-on-demand or similar platforms. A package typically involves an initial fee per episode as well as a back-end profit participation paid directly from a studio. We generally recognize the initial fee when a program is completed and delivered to the network.
When our commission is generated from an arrangement that involves an underlying license of intellectual property, we recognize such revenue in accordance with the sales-or usage-based royalty exception under ASC 606. Such arrangements primarily include:
•Client profit participation: primarily relates to our client’s participation in the net profitability of an episodic television series or feature film in which they have played a role. Once the profit participation metric is achieved, we recognize commission revenue related to the sales or usage of the underlying functional intellectual property over time as the sales or usage occurs. The amount of revenue recognized is based on either statements received or management’s best estimate of sales or usage in a period when statements are received on a lag. If our estimates and judgments were to change, the timing and amount of revenue recognized may be different.
•Package back-end profit participation: relates to our right to participate in the profitability of a television program, which is generally equal to a percentage of a contractually defined profitability measure. Once the profit participation metric is achieved, we recognize revenue related to the sales or usage of the underlying functional intellectual property over time as the sales or usage occurs. The amount of revenue recognized is based on either statements received or management’s best estimate of sales or usage in a period, if statements are received on a lag. If our estimates and judgments were to change, the timing and amount of revenue recognized may be different.
•Licensing: relates to royalties or commissions from sales of licensed merchandise. The nature of the licensing arrangements is typically symbolic intellectual property, inclusive of logos, trade names, and trademarks related to merchandise sales. We recognize revenue related to the sales or usage of the underlying symbolic intellectual property over time as the sales or usage occurs. The amount of revenue recognized is based on either statements received or management’s best estimate of sales or usage in a period, if statements are received on a lag. If our estimates and judgments were to change, the timing and amount of revenue recognized may be different.
Content Development-based Revenue
Revenue from production services and studio fees for the production and licensing of original content, including television properties, documentaries, and films, is recognized when the content becomes available for exploitation and has been accepted by the customer. Revenue from production services of live entertainment and sporting events is recognized at the time of the event on a per event basis. Revenue from production services of editorial video content is recognized when the content is delivered to and accepted by the customer and the license period begins. Revenue for license fees that include a royalty is recognized in the period the royalty is generated following the sales and usage-based royalty exception for licenses of functional intellectual property.
Content Distribution and Sales-based Revenue
License fees from live entertainment and sporting event media rights are recognized when the event is aired. License fees for non-live event programming are recognized when the program has been delivered and is available for exploitation. Commission revenue from distribution and sales arrangements for television properties, documentaries and films of independent production companies is recognized when the underlying content becomes available for view or telecast and has been accepted by the customer.
Event-based Revenue
We earn revenue from events that we control in addition to providing event related services to events controlled by third parties. For controlled events (owned or licensed), revenue is generally recognized for each performance obligation over the course of the event, multiple events, or contract term in accordance with the pattern of delivery for the particular revenue source. Advance ticket sales, participation entry fees, hospitality sales and bundled experience packages are recorded as deferred revenue pending the event date. For event management related services to third party controlled events, revenue is generally recognized over the course of the event, multiple events, or contract term in accordance with the pattern of delivery for the service. If such revenues were recognized based on another basis, or if we made different determinations about which method to apply to a given arrangement, the timing of our revenue and operating expenses may be different.
Service Fee-based Revenue
We provide marketing and consultancy services to brands with expertise in brand strategy, activation, sponsorships, endorsements, creative development and design, digital and original content, public relations, live events, branded impact, and B2B services. Marketing revenue is either recognized over time, based on the number of labor hours incurred, costs incurred or time elapsed based on the Company’s historical practice of transferring similar services to customers, or at a point in time for live event activation engagements. Consulting fees are typically recognized over time, either based on the number of labor hours incurred or evenly throughout the service period.
Revenue from our digital streaming video solutions is generally recognized upon delivery of the offering to the consumer or over the course of an over-the-top distribution platform subscription agreement term. Revenues from subscription services based on usage, such as data volume, are generally recognized as services are utilized by the customer.
Revenue from our sports academy is recognized ratably over the period of the athletes’ enrollment or attendance at a facility, as the services provided are substantially the same throughout the service period.
If such revenues were recognized based on another basis, or if we made different determinations about which method to apply to a given arrangement, the timing of our revenue and operating expenses may be different.
Pay-per-view Revenue
We recognize revenue from pay-per-view ("PPV") programming from owned live sporting events when the event is aired. PPV programming is distributed through cable, satellite and digital providers. We receive a fixed license fee for our domestic residential PPV programming under a long-term contract. For our international and commercial PPV, the amount of revenue recognized is based upon management’s initial estimate of variable consideration related to the number of buys achieved. This initial estimate is based on preliminary buy information received from certain PPV distributors and is subject to adjustment as new information regarding the number of buys is received, which is generally up to 120 days subsequent to the live event. If our estimates of buys achieved were to change, the timing and amount of our revenue may be different.
Content Costs
We incur costs to produce and distribute film and episodic content, which are either monetized on a title-by-title basis or as a group through subscriptions from customers. These costs include development costs, direct costs of production as well as allocations of overhead and capitalized interest, where applicable. Our content costs are predominately monetized on a title-by-title basis. Depending on the predominant monetization strategy, content costs are amortized over the estimated period of ultimate revenue subject to an individual-film-forecast model based on our estimate of ultimate revenue or over the estimated usage of the film group. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.
Unamortized content costs are also tested for impairment based on the predominant monetization strategy whenever there is an impairment indication, as a result of certain triggering events or changes in circumstances, that the fair value of the individual film and television content or collectively with others as a film group may be less than its unamortized costs. The impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the individual content or collectively with others as a group to the carrying value of the unamortized content costs. Where the unamortized content costs exceed the fair value, the excess is recorded as an impairment charge in direct operating costs.
We amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each season in the arrangement.
Goodwill
Goodwill is tested annually as of October 1 for impairment and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. We perform our goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the operating segment level. We have three operating and reportable segments, consistent with the way management makes decisions and allocates resources to the business and we have ten reporting units across these three segments.
We have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. A qualitative assessment includes, but is not limited to, consideration of the results of our most recent quantitative impairment test, consideration of macroeconomic conditions, and industry and market conditions. If we can support the conclusion that it is “not more likely than not” that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount under the qualitative assessment, we would not need to perform the quantitative impairment test for that reporting unit.
If we cannot support such a conclusion or we do not elect to perform the qualitative assessment then we must perform the quantitative impairment test. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. We apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. We believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.
The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses along with discount rates. Our long-term cash flow projections are estimates and inherently subject to uncertainty, particularly during periods of adverse economic conditions. Significant estimates and assumptions specific to each reporting unit include revenue growth, profit margins, terminal value growth rates, discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management. Where a market approach is utilized, we use judgment in identifying the relevant comparable-company market multiples. These estimates and assumptions may vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and
circumstances specific to that unit. If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ.
If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, such excess is recognized as an impairment. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our annual impairment test resulted in no impairment charges.
We believe that the estimates and assumptions we made in our quantitative analysis are reasonable, but they are susceptible to change from period to period. Actual results of operations, cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation, and it is possible that differences and changes could be material. A deterioration in profitability, adverse market conditions, significant client losses, changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future.
Intangible Assets
For finite-lived intangible assets that are amortized, we evaluate assets for recoverability when there is an indication of potential impairment or when the useful lives are no longer appropriate. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a group of assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of that group of assets, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group’s long-lived assets and the carrying value of the group’s long-lived assets. We define an asset group by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. If identified, the impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts, but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value.
Identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment as of October 1 and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible may not be recoverable. We have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is “more likely than not” to have occurred. In the qualitative assessment, we must evaluate the totality of qualitative factors, including any recent fair value measurements, that impact whether an indefinite-lived intangible asset has a carrying amount that “more likely than not” exceeds its fair value. We must then conduct a quantitative analysis if we (1) determine that such an impairment is “more likely than not” to exist, or (2) forego the qualitative assessment entirely. The impairment test for identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of the asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values. If we had established different asset groups or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.
Equity-Based Compensation
We grant equity awards to certain executives, employees and service providers, which may be in the form of various equity-based awards such as restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock options.
We record compensation costs related to our equity awards issued to executives and other employees based on the grant date fair value of the award. Compensation cost for time-based awards is recognized ratably over the applicable vesting period and compensation cost for awards with a performance condition is reassessed each period and recognized based upon the probability that the performance conditions will be achieved. The awards with a performance condition are expensed when the achievement of performance conditions is probable. Compensation cost for performance-based awards with a market condition is recognized regardless of the number of units that vest based on the market condition and is recognized on straight-line basis over the estimated service period, with each tranche separately measured. Compensation expense is not reversed even if the market condition is not satisfied.
For periods following the reorganization transactions and the IPO, the fair value of time-based restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the price of our common stock on the grant date. The fair value and the related derived service period of performance-based awards with a market condition are determined based on the Monte Carlo simulation model.
We estimate the fair value of stock options using an option-pricing model, which requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions, such as:
•Expected term-The expected term represents the period that our awards are expected to be outstanding, giving considerations to vesting schedules and expiration dates (if applicable). We use the simplified method for estimating the expected term of the stock options.
•Expected volatility-As we do not have a sufficient public market trading history, the expected volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility of public companies that are deemed to be comparable to us over the expected term of the award. Industry peers consist of several public companies in our industry which are either similar in size, stage of life cycle or financial leverage.
•Risk-Free Interest Rate-We base the risk-free interest rate on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time the awards are granted.
•Expected Dividends-We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero.
The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent management’s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our equity-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.
Investments
We have various equity investments that we account for under the equity method, as equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. In assessing the potential impairment of these investments, we consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investees and market values, where available. If these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value, impairment charges may be required. We also remeasure our equity investments without readily determinable fair values when there is an observable transaction in a similar class of security to our investment.
Income Taxes
EGH was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in January 2019. It was formed as a holding company for the purpose of completing an IPO and other related transactions. As the sole managing member of Endeavor Manager, which is the sole managing member of EOC, EGH operates and controls all the business and affairs of EOC, and through EOC and its subsidiaries, conducts the Company’s business. EGH is subject to corporate income tax on its share of taxable income or loss of EOC, derived from Endeavor Manager. EOC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is therefore not subject to U.S. corporate income tax. However, certain of EOC’s subsidiaries are subject to U.S. or foreign corporate income tax.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Significant factors considered by us in estimating the probability of the realization of deferred tax assets include expectations of future earnings and taxable income, as well as application of tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. A valuation allowance is provided when we determine that it is “more likely than not” that a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Our deferred tax positions may change if our estimates regarding future realization of deferred tax assets were to change.
A minimum probability threshold for a tax position must be met before a financial statement benefit is recognized. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The tax benefits ultimately realized by us may differ from those recognized in our financial statements based on a number of factors, including our decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and our success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.
We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the income tax expense line in the consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included in the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet.
Tax Receivable Agreements Liability
Generally, we are required under the tax receivable agreements to make payments to the TRA Holders that are generally equal to 85% of the applicable cash tax savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that we realize or are deemed to realize (determined by using certain assumptions) as a result of favorable tax attributes that will be available to us as a result of certain transactions contemplated in connection with our IPO, exchanges of Endeavor Operating Company Units for Class A common stock or cash and payments made under the tax receivable agreements. The actual tax benefit, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the tax receivable agreements, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including, among others, the timing of redemptions or exchanges by members of Endeavor Operating Company, the price of our Class A common stock at the time of the redemptions or exchanges, the extent to which such redemptions or exchanges are taxable, the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future and the tax rate then applicable, and the portion of our payments under the tax receivable agreements constituting imputed interest. Estimating future taxable income is inherently uncertain and requires judgment. In projecting future taxable income, we consider our historical results as well as assumptions related to future forecasts for our various businesses by location. The impact of any changes in the total projected obligations recorded under the tax receivable agreements as a result of actual changes in the geographic mix of our earnings, changes in tax legislation and tax rates or other factors that may impact our actual tax savings realized will be reflected in income before taxes in the period in which the change occurs.
Consolidation
We typically consolidate entities in which we own more than 50% of the voting common stock and control operations, as well as variable interest entities (“VIE”) for which we are deemed the primary beneficiary.
Evaluating whether an entity in which we have a variable interest is a VIE and whether we are the primary beneficiary requires management to make significant judgments involving evaluating the fair value and capitalization of the investee along with the most significant activities of the entity and the party that has power over those activities.
Business Combinations
We account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value. Additionally, contingent consideration is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and classified as a liability. Goodwill is recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired, net of assumed liabilities. Determining the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interest requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash flows, discount rates and asset lives, among other items. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments, in the period in which they are determined, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.
Non-Controlling Interest
Non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries represent the component of common equity in consolidated subsidiaries held by third parties. Non-controlling interests with redemption features, such as put options, that are redeemable outside of our control are considered redeemable non-controlling interests and are classified as temporary equity on the consolidated balance sheet. Redeemable non-controlling interests are recorded at the greater of carrying value, which is adjusted for the non-controlling interests’ share of net income or loss, or estimated redemption value at each reporting period. Estimating the fair value or other redemption value requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions specific to each non-controlling interest including revenue growth, profit margins, terminal value growth rates, discount rates under the income approach and other assumptions such as market multiples for comparable companies. These estimates and assumptions may vary between each redeemable non-controlling interest depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that consolidated subsidiary.
Recent Accounting Standards
See Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further information on certain accounting standards that have been recently adopted or that have not yet been required to be implemented and may be applicable to our future operations.
