Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the Company's financial information and its audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, included in this Form 10-K. The following information contains forward-looking statements; see “Forward-Looking Statements” on page 4 of this report.
Operational Results
The Company continues to optimize completion techniques in order to enhance well performance across its portfolio. The following table and discussion highlights SilverBow's drilling and completion schedule for 2021:
(1) Other includes non-core properties.
During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company completed and brought five net wells online. There was minimal drilling activity in the fourth quarter related to one gross non-operated well. For the full year, SilverBow drilled 18 net wells and completed and brought online 24 net wells.
The Company finished drilling one well in its Webb County Gas area in January 2021 and released its one drilling rig thereafter as part of a planned pause in development activity. In April 2021, SilverBow elected to accelerate and expand its planned mid-year liquids development program. This decision was based on favorable commodity prices and completion activity running ahead of schedule and under budget on development projects during the year. The Company’s liquids development was focused primarily on its La Salle Condensate and McMullen Oil areas and comprised 11 net wells drilled and completed during the year. Additionally, five net Webb County Gas wells were incorporated in the expanded mid-year development and drilled in the third quarter of 2021. The drilling and completion activity over the second and third quarters drove production growth and higher cash flow in the second half of the year. SilverBow released its sole drilling rig in September 2021, and had no operated activity until the resumption of drilling at its Webb County Gas area in late December 2021.
In total the Company drilled six net operated wells in its Webb County Gas area in 2021. Of these, three net wells were in the Austin Chalk, a zone which the Company has been focused on proving up for future development. The Austin Chalk wells in Webb County continue to exceed expectations and exhibit strong commercial economics. SilverBow brought a fourth Austin Chalk well online in early 2022 in its Webb County Gas area, further enhancing its ability to deliver consistent and repeatable results across the position. The first well has produced approximately 3.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas in its first year. The Austin Chalk wells averaged 7,500 foot laterals with drilling and completion (“D&C”) costs of $727 per lateral foot, which compares favorably to recent Austin Chalk results from nearby operators. Given that D&C activity in the Austin Chalk to-date has focused on single-pad, delineation wells, SilverBow expects to realize greater cost efficiencies for future full-scale development. In the La Mesa and Fasken fields, multi-zone pad development efficiencies led to lower drilling and completion costs as the Company continued to leverage its technical experience and long operating history in the area. SilverBow also elected to participate in three gross non-operated wells in Webb County which were drilled in the second half of 2021 and will benefit from production in early 2022.
The Company closed three acquisitions in the second half of 2021. From the closing of each of these respective acquisitions, in aggregate, SilverBow added 286 barrels per day (“Bbls/d”) of liquids and 4.5 million cubic feet per day (“MMcf/d”) to the Company's full year net production. Additionally, the acquired assets provided SilverBow a deep runway of future oil and gas development locations in the Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk. The Company added more than 200 net drilling
locations from acquired assets in 2021, with further inventory upside potential based on optimizations to well costs, spacing and lateral lengths given the highly contiguous lease footprints with SilverBow's existing acreage. The Company is working to integrate these new assets into its low cost structure and should benefit from greater operating cost synergies due to increased size and scale. The acquisition activity in 2021 reflects a continued focus on identifying opportunities to add to core positions in high-return areas.
SilverBow's asset management program seeks to optimize recoverability and operating costs from producing wells. The Company proactively invests in workovers, compression and artificial lift installations and other enhancements to maintain production output, improve its base decline and lower field operating costs. Furthermore, SilverBow prioritizes operational safety and maintains a goal of zero total recordable incidents. The Company's production operations group recently celebrated its five year anniversary with zero OSHA recordable accidents.
SilverBow has spent last several years positioning its inventory and development plans to be flexible. This has allowed the Company to align with prevailing commodity prices, and to drive greater operational efficiencies by concentrating its efforts in areas in which the team possesses deep technical expertise and experience. Across all of its operating areas in the Eagle Ford in 2021, SilverBow drilled 10% more lateral footage per day while lowering completion costs per well by 17% as compared to 2020. The Company's demonstrated success in increasing field efficiencies, reducing cycle times and lowering costs is a direct result of its operational and supply teams working with vendors to negotiate prices and logistical considerations for the materials used in its operations. As a result, SilverBow's drilling and completion costs per lateral foot in 2021 decreased by 13% as compared to 2020. Although the rate of operational efficiency gains are anticipated to slow as the Company approaches field level limitations and focuses on developing newly acquired acreage requiring potentially longer transition times, maintaining and improving upon the efficiency gains to-date is core to SilverBow's cost mitigation efforts within an inflationary service cost environment expected in its near-term outlook.
Cost reduction initiatives: The Company continues to focus on cost reduction measures in the areas that it can control. These initiatives include the use of regional sand in completions, improved utilization of existing facilities, elimination of redundant equipment and replacement of rental equipment with SilverBow-owned equipment. As previously mentioned, the Company continues to improve its process for drilling, completing and equipping wells. SilverBow's procurement team takes a process-oriented approach to managing the total delivered costs of purchased services by examining costs at their most granular level. Services are routinely sourced directly from the suppliers. The Company's lease operating expenses were $27.7 million or $0.35 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $21.4 million or $0.32 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in costs was due to incremental expenses related to Winter Storm Uri, higher salt water disposal, higher compression costs and higher utilities. These increases were partially mitigated by lower treating costs.
SilverBow's net G&A expenses were $21.8 million or $0.28 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2021. After deducting $4.6 million of share-based compensation, cash G&A expenses (a non-GAAP financial measure) were $17.2 million or $0.22 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2021. This compares to net G&A expenses of $22.6 million or $0.34 per Mcfe for the same period in 2020. After deducting $4.6 million of share-based compensation, cash G&A expenses (a non-GAAP financial measure) were $18.0 million or $0.27 per Mcfe for the same period in 2020.
The Company continued to maintain a safe working environment while implementing these cost-reduction efforts. SilverBow's corporate total recordable incident rate was 0.15 incidents per 1.3 million work hours in 2021.
The Company reports cash G&A because it believes this measure is commonly used by management, analysts and investors as an indicator of cost management and operating efficiency on a comparable basis from period to period. In addition, SilverBow believes cash G&A expenses are used by analysts and others in valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas industry to allow for analysis of G&A spend without regard to stock-based compensation programs which can vary substantially from company to company. Cash G&A expenses should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, total G&A expenses.
Summary of 2021 Financial Results
•Revenues and net income (loss): The Company's oil and gas revenues were $407.2 million and $177.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Revenues were higher due to increased production volumes and overall higher commodity pricing. The Company had net income of $86.8 million and a net loss of $309.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase was primarily due to higher revenues due to increased production volumes and higher commodity pricing along with no non-cash impairment write-down during the current period.
•Capital expenditures: The Company's capital expenditures (excluding acquisitions) on an accrual basis were $130.5 million and $95.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, were primarily driven by continued legacy development. These expenditures were funded by cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility.
•Acquisitions: The Company closed three acquisitions in the second half of 2021. These acquisitions, in aggregate, added 286 barrels per day of liquids and 4.5 million cubic feet per day to SilverBow’s full year net production. This represents less than 3% of the Company's full year 2021 net production. SilverBow expects these acquisitions to comprise a greater percentage of its full year 2022 net production with a full year's contribution. In total the Company paid $50.6 million in cash and issued $83.5 million in equity related to these transactions.
•Working capital: The Company had a working capital deficit of $65.8 million and $23.1 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The working capital computation does not include available liquidity through our Credit Facility.
•Cash Flow: For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company generated cash from operating activities of $215.7 million, of which $6.2 million was attributable to changes in working capital. Cash used for property additions was $133.6 million. This included $4.0 million attributable to a net decrease of capital related payables and accrued costs. Additionally, $1.1 million was paid during the year for property sale obligations related to the sale of our former Bay De Chene field. The Company’s net repayments under its revolving Credit Facility were $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and repayments under its Second Lien Facility were $50.0 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company generated cash from operating activities of $165.2 million, of which $7.1 million was attributable to changes in working capital. Cash used for property additions was $114.7 million. This included $19.4 million attributable to a net decrease of capital related to payables and accrued costs. Additionally, $0.8 million was paid during the year for property sale obligations related to the sale of our former Bay De Chene field. The Company's net repayments under its Credit Facility were $49.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
SilverBow's primary use of cash has been to fund capital expenditures to develop its oil and gas properties. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s liquidity consisted of approximately $1.1 million of cash-on-hand and $233.0 million in available borrowings on its Credit Facility, which had a $460.0 million borrowing base. SilverBow's 2022 capital budget, which is expected to be in the range of $180-$200 million, provides for drilling 39 gross (33 net) horizontal wells and is expected to be funded primarily from operating cash flow. Management believes the Company has sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations through at least the first quarter of 2023 and execute its long-term development plans. See Note 4 to SilverBow's consolidated financial statements for more information on its Debt Facilities.
ATM Program. On August 13, 2021, the Company entered into an equity distribution agreement pursuant to which the SilverBow may sell, from time to time in the open market, shares of the Company’s common stock, having aggregate proceeds of up to $40.0 million (the “ATM Program”). SilverBow intends to use the net proceeds from any sales through the ATM Program for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, financing of capital expenditures, repayment or refinancing of outstanding debt, financing acquisitions or investments, financing other business opportunities, and general working capital purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2021 (from August 13, 2021 through December 31, 2021), the Company sold 1,222,209 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $27.0 million after deducting sales agents' commissions and other related expenses.
Senior Secured Second Lien Notes. Effective November 12, 2021, SilverBow entered into the Second Amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement, which extended the maturity date from December 15, 2024 to December 15, 2026 subject to paying down the principal amount of the Second Lien from $200.0 million to $150.0 million. The Company made the $50 million redemption of the Second Lien Notes on November 29, 2021. SilverBow accounted for this paydown as a debt modification and incurred approximately $0.1 million in third party fees in connection with the amendment. The unamortized debt issuance cost and discount on the Second Lien Notes will be amortized through the new maturity date of December 15, 2026.
Contractual Commitments and Obligations
Our contractual commitments for the next five years and thereafter are shown below as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands):
(1) Amounts shown represent fees for the minimum delivery obligations. Any amount of transportation utilized in excess of the minimum will reduce future year obligations. The Company's production and reserves are currently sufficient to fulfill the current minimum delivery obligations.
(2) Interest on our Credit Facility is estimated using the weighted average interest rate of 4.34% for the quarter ended December 31, 2021, while interest on our Second Lien is estimated using LIBOR plus 7.5%. See Note 4 of these consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for more information. Actual interest rate is variable over the term of the facility.
(3) Amount shown primarily for obligation under Bay De Chene sales contract.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2021, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements requiring disclosure pursuant to article 303(a) of Regulation S-K.
Proved Oil and Gas Reserves
During 2021, our reserves increased by approximately 309.4 Bcfe due to increases in our natural gas reserves primarily from our Austin Chalk area and contributions from acquisitions closed in the second half of 2021. As of December 31, 2021, 46% of our total proved reserves were proved developed, compared with 46% and 41% at year-end 2020 and 2019.
At December 31, 2021, our proved reserves were 1,415.8 Bcfe with a Standardized Measure of $1.6 billion, which is an increase of approximately $1.0 billion, or 204%, from the prior year-end levels. In 2021, our proved natural gas reserves increased 207.3 Bcf, or 22%, while our proved oil reserves increased 11.8 MMBbl, or 94%, and our NGL reserves increased 5.2 MMBbl, or 38%, for a total equivalent increase of 309.4 Bcfe, or 28%.
We have added proved reserves primarily through our drilling activities and acquisitions, including 359.4 Bcfe added in 2021. We obtained reasonable certainty regarding these reserve additions by applying the same methodologies that have been used historically in this area.
We use the preceding 12-month's average price based on closing prices on the first business day of each month, adjusted for price differentials, in calculating our average prices used in the Standardized Measure calculation. Our average natural gas price used in the Standardized Measure calculation for 2021 was $3.75 per Mcf. This average price increased from the average price of $2.13 per Mcf used for 2020. Our average oil price used in the calculation for 2021 was $63.98 per Bbl. This average price increased from the average price of $37.83 per Bbl used in the calculation for 2020. Our average NGL price used in the calculation for 2021 was $25.29 per Bbl. This average price increased from the average price of $11.66 per Bbl used in the calculation for 2020.
Results of Operations
Revenues - Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
2021 - Our oil and gas sales in 2021 increased by 130% compared to revenues in 2020, primarily due to overall higher commodity pricing and higher production volumes. Average oil prices we received were 78% higher than those received during 2020, while natural gas prices were 115% higher and NGL prices were 113% higher.
Crude oil production was 11% and 14% of our production volumes for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, while crude oil sales revenues were 24% and 33% of oil and gas sales revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Natural gas production was 77% and 76% of our production volumes for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, while natural gas sales revenues were 66% and 59% and of oil and gas sales for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
NGL production was 12% and 10% of our production volumes for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, while NGL sales were 10% and 8% of oil and gas sales for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The following tables provide information regarding the changes in the sources of our oil and gas sales and volumes for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Our sales volume increase from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to higher natural gas and NGL production, partially offset by lower crude oil production.
In 2021, our $229.8 million, or 130%, increase in oil, NGL, and natural gas sales resulted from:
•Volume variances that had a $22.0 million favorable impact on sales, with a $2.3 million decrease due to the 0.1 million Bbl decrease in oil production volumes, a $19.7 million increase due to the 9.5 Bcf increase in natural gas production volumes and a $4.7 million increase due to the 0.4 million Bbl increase in NGL production volumes.
•Price variances that had a $207.8 million favorable impact on sales, with an increase of $142.8 million due to the 114% increase in natural gas prices received, an increase of $43.2 million due to the 78% increase in oil prices received and an increase of $21.7 million due to the 113% increase in NGL prices received.
The following table provides additional information regarding our oil and gas sales, by commodity type, as well as the effects of our hedging activities for derivative contracts held to settlement for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands, except per-dollar amounts):
(1) Oil and natural gas liquids are converted at the rate of one barrel to six Mcfe.
(2) Excludes the impact of the $38.3 million for derivative contracts monetized in the first quarter of 2020.
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 we recorded net losses of $123 million and net gains of $61.3 million, respectively, related to our derivative activities. Included in our gain during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $38.3 million for monetized derivative contracts received in the first quarter of 2020. The change was driven primarily by changes in commodity pricing. This activity is recorded in “Net gain (loss) on commodity derivatives” on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations in this Form 10-K.
Costs and Expenses
The following table provides additional information regarding our expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Our costs and expenses during 2021 versus 2020 were as follows:
General and Administrative Expenses, Net. These expenses on a per Mcfe basis were $0.28 and $0.34 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease per Mcfe was due to higher production while the decrease in costs was primarily due to lower salaries and burdens, temporary labor expenses and legal fees. Included in general and administrative expenses is $4.6 million in share-based compensation for both the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (“DD&A”). These expenses on a per Mcfe basis were $0.88 and $0.97 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our full year 2020 DD&A rate was impacted by non-cash impairment writedowns in the first half of 2020. Our DD&A rate is impacted by the timing and amount or reserve additions and the future development costs associated with those additions, revisions of previous reserve estimates, non-cash impairment writedowns, acquisitions and dispositions of proved reserves and the amount of costs subject to amortization.
Lease Operating Expenses. These expenses on a per Mcfe basis were $0.35 and $0.32 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in costs is due to higher compression costs and salt water disposal costs, partially offset by lower treating costs.
Transportation and gas processing. These expenses all related to natural gas and NGL sales. These expenses on a per Mcfe basis were $0.31 for both the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Severance and Other Taxes. In general, severance taxes are based upon current year commodity prices and production whereas ad valorem taxes are based upon the value of oil and gas reserves at the beginning of the year. Severance taxes are paid on produced oil and natural gas based on a percentage of revenues from products sold. The increase in severance and other taxes is directly attributable to the increase in oil and gas revenues associated with higher commodity prices. Our ad valorem expense included in Severance and other taxes remained relatively consistent from 2020 to 2021. Severance and other taxes, as a percentage of oil and gas sales, were approximately 4.7% and 5.9% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Interest Expense. Our gross interest expense was $29.1 million and $31.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in gross interest was primarily due to decreased borrowings. There was no capitalized interest for both of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Write-down of oil and gas properties. There was no impairment for the year ended December 31, 2021. Due to the effects of pricing, we reported a non-cash impairment write-down of $355.9 million impairment for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Income Taxes. The Company recorded an income tax provision of $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 which was primarily attributable to deferred federal income tax expense. In March and April 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused volatility in the market price for crude oil due to the disruption of global supply and demand. In response to these market conditions and given the decline in oil prices and economic outlook for the Company, management determined that it
was not more likely than not that the Company would realize future cash benefits from its remaining federal carryover items and other deferred tax assets and, accordingly, recorded a full valuation allowance in the second quarter of 2020 to offset its net deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities. This resulted in tax expense of $21.2 million in the second quarter of 2020. Our income tax provision of $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 is inclusive of state income tax benefit of $1.8 million.
Critical Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements
Property and Equipment. We follow the “full-cost” method of accounting for oil and natural gas property and equipment costs. Under this method of accounting, all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in the exploration, development, and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized including internal costs incurred that are directly related to these activities and which are not related to production, general corporate overhead, or similar activities. Future development costs are estimated on a property-by-property basis based on current economic conditions and are amortized to expense as our capitalized oil and natural gas property costs are amortized. We compute the provision for DD&A of oil and natural gas properties using the unit-of-production method.
The costs of unproved properties not being amortized are assessed quarterly, on a property-by-property basis, to determine whether such properties have been impaired. In determining whether such costs should be impaired, we evaluate current drilling results, lease expiration dates, current oil and gas industry conditions, international economic conditions, capital availability, and available geological and geophysical information. As these factors may change from period to period, our evaluation of these factors will change. Any impairment assessed is added to the cost of proved properties being amortized.
The calculation of the provision for DD&A requires us to use estimates related to quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and estimates of the impairment of unproved properties. The estimation process for both reserves and the impairment of unproved properties is subjective, and results may change over time based on current information and industry conditions. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from such estimates.
Full-Cost Ceiling Test. At the end of each quarterly reporting period, the unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties (including natural gas processing facilities, capitalized asset retirement obligations and deferred income taxes, and excluding the recognized asset retirement obligation liability) is limited to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties (excluding cash outflows from recognized asset retirement obligations, including future development and abandonment costs of wells to be drilled, using the preceding 12-months’ average price based on closing prices on the first day of each month, adjusted for price differentials, discounted at 10%, and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties) adjusted for related income tax effects. At December 31, 2021, the discounted present value of our estimated total proved reserves adjusted for related income tax effects exceeded our unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties by approximately $0.9 billion.
We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from such estimates.
If future capital expenditures outpace future discounted net cash flow in our reserve calculations, if we have significant declines in our oil and natural gas reserves volumes (which also reduces our estimate of discounted future net cash flow from proved oil and natural gas reserves) or if oil or natural gas prices remain depressed or continue to decline, it is possible that non-cash write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties will occur in the future. We cannot control and cannot predict what future prices for oil and natural gas will be, thus we cannot estimate the amount or timing of any potential future non-cash write-down of our oil and natural gas properties due to decreases in oil or natural gas prices.
New Accounting Pronouncements. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-03. ASU 2020-03 improves and clarifies various financial instruments topics, including the current expected credit loss standard (“CECL”). ASU 2020-03 includes seven different issues that describe the areas of improvement and the related amendments to GAAP, intended to make the standards easier to understand and apply by eliminating inconsistencies and providing clarifications. This guidance is effective beginning on January 1, 2023 for smaller reporting companies. We are still assessing the requirements to determine the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06. This ASU simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity. For convertible instruments with conversion features that are not accounted for as derivatives under ASC 815 or do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, the convertible instrument's embedded conversion features are no longer
separated from the host contract. Consequently, and as long as no other feature requires bifurcation and recognition as a derivative, the convertible instrument is accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost. This ASU also amends the impact of convertible instruments on the calculation of diluted earnings per share (EPS) and adds several new disclosure requirements. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. The ASU can be adopted on either a fully retrospective or modified retrospective basis. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or disclosures.
In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04. This guidance provides clarification and reduces diversity in an issuer’s accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options (such as warrants) that remain equity classified after modification or exchange. An issuer measures the effect of a modification or exchange as the difference between the fair value of the modified or exchanged warrant and the fair value of that warrant immediately before modification or exchange. The ASU introduces a recognition model that comprises four categories of transactions and the corresponding accounting treatment for each category (equity issuance, debt origination, debt modification, and modifications unrelated to equity issuance and debt origination or modification). This guidance is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or disclosures.
