See “Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.

Plan of Operation
Background:
On June 22, 2017, the Group filed an Amended Certificate of Incorporation (the “Amendment”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Oklahoma, to (i) change its name from “3DIcon Corporation” to “The Coretec Group Inc.” and to (ii) effect a 1-for-300 reverse stock split. The Name Change and Reverse Split became effective with the State of Oklahoma on June 28, 2017 and with FINRA on June 29, 2017.
The Group was incorporated on August 11, 1995, under the laws of the State of Oklahoma as First Keating Corporation. The articles of incorporation were amended August 1, 2003 to change the name to 3DIcon Corporation. During 2001, First Keating Corporation began to focus on the development of 360-degree holographic technology. On July 15, 2005, the Group entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement (“SRA”) with the University of Oklahoma (the “University” or “OU”), which expired on January 14, 2007, under which they conducted a research project entitled "Investigation of 3-Dimensional Display Technologies”. On February 23, 2007, they entered into an SRA with the University, which expired on March 31, 2010, under which they conducted a research project entitled "3-Dimensional Display Development". The development to date has resulted in multiple new technologies, two working laboratory prototypes (Lab Proto 1 and Lab Proto 2), and eight provisional patents; five of the eight provisional patents have been combined and converted to five utility patents. Under the SRA, the Group has obtained the exclusive worldwide marketing rights to these 3D display technologies.
All descriptions of technology, business model, near term revenue opportunities, and recent developments required by this Item are attached hereto in Item I, Business Overview and are hereby incorporated by reference.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020
Revenue
We did not have revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Research and Development Expenses
The research and development expenses were $469,996 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $151,864 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The approximate $318,000 increase was a result of approximately $234,000 increase in stock option expenses, approximately $56,000 increase in CHS materials for research activities, approximately $18,000 legal fees related to intellectual property and approximately $10,000 increase in consultant compensation cost in 2021.
General and Administrative Expenses
Our general and administrative expenses were $5,615,038 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $1,029,136 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The approximately $4,586,000 net increase was largely a result of the increase in stock option expense. Stock option expense included in the year ended December 31, 2021 was approximately $4,365,000 compared with the approximately $125,000 of option expense incurred for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Other significant increases during the year ended December 31, 2021 include approximately $145,000 in consulting costs for sales and marketing, approximately $106,000 in consulting costs for finance and executive management, approximately $42,000 in costs for marketing activities and press releases, approximately $29,000 in market research expense, and approximately $16,000 in accounting fees related to security registration filings.
These increased expenses were offset by reductions of approximately $16,000 for legal expenses and approximately $10,000 in rent expenses.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $229,525 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $665,232 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The decrease of approximately $436,000 was primarily a result of a reduction in beneficial conversion feature expense of approximately $460,000. This reduction in expense results from adoption of a recent accounting pronouncement, as described in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. In addition, reductions of approximately $14,000 related to amortization of warrant debt costs and approximately $3,000 related to amortization of deferred costs were realized for DAF activities. These reductions were offset by an increase in approximately $41,000 of stated interest on the DAF loan.
Other Income
Other income was $45,620 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $1,250 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to a transaction on September 30, 2021, where the Company received $45,000 to vacate leased office space and assign the lease to a third party.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
Management remains focused on controlling cash expenses. We recognize our responsibility for advancing our technology and plan our expenses accordingly. We intend to leverage stock-for-services wherever possible. The 2022 fiscal year operating budget consists of the following expenses:
●
Production of CHS for sale and evaluation by customer base and research institutes
● Research and development costs for internal lab activities and staff, CHS sponsored research activities, Chief Technological consultant and costs related to strengthening our patent portfolio
● Sales staff to support CHS customer relationships
● Chief Marketing consultant, marketing outreach and public relations firm to bolster the Company’s message and digital platform
● General and administrative expenses: Chief Executive and Chief Financial officer expenses, salaries, insurance, investor related expenses, rent, travel, website, etc.
● Professional fees for accounting and audit; legal services for securities and financing
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash of $4,053,327 and a positive net working capital of $3,879,722.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we used $1,114,230 of cash for operating activities, a decrease of $238,672 or 18% compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
The decrease in the use of cash for operating activities was a net result of the increase in the loss from operations of $4,423,957, the decrease in amortization of debt discount of $476,430, the increase in the options issued for services of $4,506,895, the increase in common stock issued for services of $261,246, the increase in the change in prepaid expenses of $137,614, the increase in the change in deposits of $17,974, and the increase in the change in accounts payable of $214,257.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, there was $12,007 of cash used for investing activities from capitalized website costs.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, there was $5,157,345 of cash provided by financing activities, an increase of $3,840,373 or 292% compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
The increase was a result of the March 2, 2021, private placement stock purchase agreement and net proceeds of $4,913,200. The private placement proceeds were offset by $20,796 increase in payments on notes payable and a $1,052,031 decrease in proceeds of debt and warrants issued.
Raising additional funds for future activities could be achieved through a potential reverse merger arrangement or an additional financing partnership. Our ability to fund the future operations of the Company is highly dependent on the underlying stock price of the Company.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not engage in any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our consolidated financial condition, revenues, and results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures.
