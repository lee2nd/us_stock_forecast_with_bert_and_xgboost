Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The discussion and analysis of the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements are based upon its audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these audited consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
The following is a summary of the more judgmental and complex accounting estimates and principles. In each area, we have identified the variables we believe are most important in our estimation process. We utilize information available to us to make the necessary estimates to value the related assets and liabilities. Actual performance that differs from our estimates and future changes in the key variables and information could change future valuations and impact the results of operations.

Our significant accounting policies are described in greater detail in our 2021 audited financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, specifically in “Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” which are essential to understanding Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
OVERVIEW
For the year 2021, we reported net earnings of $56.9 million, compared with $32.9 million for the year 2020. This represented an increase of $24.0 million, or 72.8%, over the prior year. The increase in net earnings reflected a $19.6 million increase in net interest income, a $4.7 million increase in non-interest income, $7.9 million decrease in the provision for loan losses and a $1.3 million decrease in non-interest expenses, which was partially offset by a $9.5 million increase in income tax expense.
At December 31, 2021, total assets were $4.2 billion, an increase of $878.1 million, or 26.2%, from total assets of $3.4 billion at December 31, 2020. Interest-earning assets were $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of $831.3 million, or 26.3%, compared to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase in interest-earning assets was primarily due to net HFI loan growth of $224.6 million and investment securities growth of $156.5 million, partially offset by a decrease of $44.0 million in mortgage loans available for sale.
At December 31, 2021, available for sale (“AFS”) investment securities totaled $368.3 million inclusive of a pre-tax net unrealized loss of $2.4 million, compared to $210.9 million inclusive of a pre-tax net unrealized gain of $1.6 million at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021, held to maturity (“HTM”) investment securities totaled $6.3 million, compared to $7.2 million as of December 31, 2020.
Net loans and leases (held for investment, net of deferred fees, discounts, and the allowance for loan losses) were $2.9 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020. Net loans and leases increased $221.0 million, or 8.3%, from December 31, 2020. The increase in net loans was due to organic growth. The increase in net loans included approximately $244.4 million in CRE loans, $116.4 million in construction loans and $26.7 million in other loans, partially offset by a $119.8 million decrease in SFR mortgage loans, $21.4 million in C&I loans and $21.7 million in SBA loans.
Total deposits were $3.4 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $750.4 million, or 28.5%, compared to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase is due to an increase of $870.8 million in non-maturity deposits, partially offset by a net decrease of $120.4 million from time deposits, and the remainder from organic growth.
Noninterest-bearing deposits were $1.3 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $674.3 million, or 109.2%, from $617.2 million at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021, noninterest-bearing deposits were 38.1% of total deposits, compared to 23.4% at December 31, 2020.
Our average cost of total deposits was 0.40% for the year 2021, compared to 1.01% for 2020. The decrease is due to a 73 basis point decrease in the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits. Borrowings, consisting of FHLB long-term advances, long-term debt and subordinated debt, increased $68.8 million to $337.5 million as of December 31, 2021 compared to $268.7 million as of December 31, 2020. The Company had no short-term FHLB advances, and $150.0 million in long-term advances at December 31, 2021 and at December 31, 2020.
The allowance for loan losses was $32.9 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of $3.6 million or 12.2%, from $29.3 million at December 31, 2020. During 2021, there was a $4.0 million provision for loan losses compared to $11.8 million for 2020. The ALLL to HFI loans and leases outstanding was 1.12% and 1.08% as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
Shareholders’ equity increased $38.2 million, or 8.9%, to $466.7 million as of December 31, 2021 from $428.5 million at December 31, 2020. The increase during 2021 was primarily due to $56.9 million of net income, less $9.9 million of common dividends paid and $10.5 million from the repurchase of common stock.
Our capital ratios under the Basel III capital framework regulatory standards remain well capitalized. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s Tier 1 leverage capital ratio was 10.21%, common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.86%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio totaled 15.40%, and total risk-based capital ratio was 23.15%.
ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Financial Performance
(1)
Earnings per share are calculated utilizing the two-class method. Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing earnings to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of shares adjusted for the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options using the treasury stock method.
(2)
Tangible book value per share, return on average tangible common equity, and tangible common equity to tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for a reconciliation of these measures to their most comparable GAAP measures.
Results of Operations-Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2020
Net Interest Income/Average Balance Sheet
In 2021, we generated fully-taxable equivalent net interest income of $124.4 million, an increase of $19.6 million, or 18.7%, from the net interest income produced in 2020. This increase was largely due to a 20.7% increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets, in part due to organic loan growth, partially offset by an 6 basis point decrease in the net interest margin. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 our reported net interest margin was 3.46% and 3.52%, respectively. Our net interest margin benefits from discount accretion on our purchased loan portfolios.
Interest Income. Total fully-taxable equivalent interest income was $147.1 million in 2021 compared to $139.2 million in 2020. The $8.0 million, or 5.7%, increase in total interest income was mainly due to increases in the average balance of total loans of $180.9 million, average balance of securities of $144.1 million, and average balance of Federal funds sold, cash equivalents and other investments of $292.2 million. This was partially offset by a decrease in the average total loan yield of 6 basis points.
Interest and fees on loans was $141.6 million in 2021 compared to $133.9 million in 2020. The $7.7 million, or 5.7%, increase in interest income on loans was primarily due to a $180.9 million increase in the average balance of total loans outstanding, partially offset by 6 basis point decrease in the average yield on total loans. The increase in the average balance of loans outstanding was primarily due to organic growth in commercial real estate and single-family residential mortgage loans during 2021. The yield on the loan portfolio benefited from accretion income associated with purchase accounting discounts established on loans acquired in prior acquisitions. For the years 2021 and 2020, the reported yield on total loans was 5.12% and 5.18%, respectively. The impact of accretion income on our yield on total loans for the years 2021 and 2020 was to increase our reported yield on total loans by 0.03% and 0.08%, respectively. A substantial portion of our acquired loan portfolio that is subject to discount accretion consists of commercial real estate loans and single family residential mortgages.
The table below illustrates by loan type the accretion income for the years 2021, 2020 and 2019:
Interest income from our securities portfolio increased $454,000, or 15.1%, to $3.5 million in 2021. The increase in interest income on securities was primarily due to an increased average balance of $144.1 million, or 78.8%, partially offset by a 58 basis point decrease in the average yield of securities.
Interest income on our federal funds sold, cash equivalents and other investments decreased $143,000, or 6.3%, to $2.1 million in 2021. The decrease in interest income on these earning assets was primarily due to a 64 basis point decrease in average yield of cash equivalents, partially offset by a $292.2 million increase in the average balance. The increase in the average balance resulted from pending utilization of these funds to higher yielding loans and securities.
Interest Expense. Interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities decreased $11.6 million, or 33.9%, to $22.7 million in 2021 primarily due to a 63 basis point decrease in the average rate on these liabilities plus an increase in average non-interest bearing deposits of $374.6 million, partially offset by a $216.5 million increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities.
Interest expense on total deposits decreased to $12.0 million in 2021. The $13.2 million, or 52.6%, decrease in interest expense on total deposits was primarily due to a 73 basis point decrease in the average rate paid on total average interest bearing deposits, partially offset by a $141.9 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits. The increase in the average balance of deposits resulted primarily from organic growth in 2021.
Interest expense on borrowings increased 17.5% from $9.2 million in 2020 to $10.8 million in 2021. This increase reflected increased average balances in long term debt. In 2021, the average rate on these liabilities was 3.34% compared to 3.70% in 2020.
Average Balance Sheet, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis
The principal component of our earnings is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest and fees earned on loans and investments (interest-earning assets) and the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds (interest-bearing liabilities). Net interest margin is net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets for the period. The level of interest rates and the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin. The net interest spread is the yield on average interest earning assets minus the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin and net interest spread are included on a tax equivalent (“TE”) basis by adjusting interest income utilizing the federal statutory tax rate of 21% for 2021, 2020 and 2019. Our net interest income, interest spread, and net interest margin are sensitive to general business and economic conditions. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, monetary supply, and the strength of the international, national and state economies, in general, and more specifically, the local economies in which we conduct business. Our ability to manage net interest income during changing interest rate environments will have a significant impact on our overall performance. We manage net interest income through affecting changes in the mix of interest-earning assets as well as the mix of interest-bearing liabilities, changes in the level of interest-bearing liabilities in proportion to interest-earning assets, and in the growth and maturity of earning assets.
