Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
This information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included with this report. The discussion and analysis that follows may contain statements that relate to future events or future performance. In some cases, such forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially. These statements are based upon certain assumptions and analyses made by the Sponsor on the basis of its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. Whether or not actual results and developments will conform to the Sponsor’s expectations and predictions, however, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the special considerations discussed below, general economic, market and business conditions, changes in laws or regulations, including those concerning taxes, made by governmental authorities or regulatory bodies, and other world economic and political developments. Although the Sponsor does not make forward-looking statements unless it believes it has a reasonable basis for doing so, the Sponsor cannot guarantee their accuracy. Except as required by applicable disclosure laws, neither the Trust nor the Sponsor is under a duty to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform such statements to actual results or to a change in the Sponsor’s expectations or predictions.
Introduction
The Trust is a grantor trust formed under the laws of the State of New York. The Trust does not have any officers, directors, or employees, and is administered by the Trustee acting as trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement. The Trust issues Shares representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in its net assets. The assets of the Trust consist primarily of gold bullion held by a custodian as an agent of the Trust responsible only to the Trustee.
The Trust is a passive investment vehicle and seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of gold. The Trust seeks to reflect such performance before payment of the Trust’s expenses and liabilities. The Trust does not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from, or ameliorate losses caused by, changes in the price of gold.
The Trust issues and redeems Shares only in exchange for gold, only in aggregations of 50,000 Shares (a “Basket”) or integral multiples thereof, and only in transactions with registered broker-dealers that have previously entered into an agreement with the Sponsor and the Trustee governing the terms and conditions of such issuance (such broker-dealers, the “Authorized Participants”). A list of the current Authorized Participants is available from the Sponsor or the Trustee.
Shares of the Trust trade on NYSE Arca, Inc. under the ticker symbol IAU.
Valuation of Gold Bullion; Computation of Net Asset Value
On each business day, as soon as practicable after 4:00 p.m. (New York time), the Trustee evaluates the gold held by the Trust and determines the net asset value of the Trust and the NAV. The Trustee values the gold held by the Trust using the price per fine troy ounce of gold determined in an electronic auction hosted by IBA that begins at 3:00 p.m. (London time) and published shortly thereafter, on the day the valuation takes place (such price, the “LBMA Gold Price PM”). If there is no announced LBMA Gold Price PM on any day, the Trustee is authorized to use the most recently announced price of gold determined in an electronic auction hosted by IBA that begins at 10:30 a.m. (London time) (such price, the “LBMA Gold Price AM”), unless the Trustee, in consultation with the Sponsor, determines that such price is inappropriate as a basis for evaluation. The LBMA Gold Price AM and LBMA Gold Price PM are used by the Trust because they are commonly used by the U.S. gold market as indicators of the value of gold and are permitted to be used under the Trust Agreement. The use of indicators of the value of gold bullion other than the LBMA Gold Price AM and LBMA Gold Price PM could result in materially different fair value pricing of the gold held by the Trust, and as such, could result in different cost or market adjustments or in different redemption value adjustments of the outstanding redeemable capital Shares. Having valued the gold held by the Trust, the Trustee then subtracts all accrued fees, expenses and other liabilities of the Trust from the total value of the gold and other assets held by the Trust. The result is the net asset value of the Trust. The Trustee computes NAV by dividing the net asset value of the Trust by the number of Shares outstanding on the date the computation is made.
Liquidity
The Trust is not aware of any trends, demands, conditions or events that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs. In exchange for a fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume most of the expenses incurred by the Trust. As a result, the only ordinary expense of the Trust during the period covered by this report was the Sponsor’s fee. The Trust’s only source of liquidity is its sales of gold.
Critical Accounting Policies
The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements relies on estimates and assumptions that impact the Trust’s financial position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions affect the Trust’s application of accounting policies. A description of the valuation of gold bullion, a critical accounting policy that the Trust believes is important to understanding its results of operations and financial position, is provided in the section entitled “Valuation of Gold Bullion; Computation of Net Asset Value” above. In addition, please refer to Note 2 to the financial statements included in this report for further discussion of the Trust’s accounting policies.
Valuation of Gold Bullion
Fair value of the gold bullion is based on the LBMA Gold Price PM. If there is no announced LBMA Gold Price PM on a business day, the Trustee is authorized to use the most recently announced LBMA Gold Price AM.
There are other indicators of the value of gold bullion that are available that could be different than that chosen by the Trust. The LBMA Gold Price AM and LBMA Gold Price PM are used by the Trust because they are commonly used by the U.S. gold market as indicators of the value of gold, and are permitted to be used under the Trust Agreement. The use of indicators of the value of gold bullion other than the LBMA Gold Price AM and LBMA Gold Price PM could result in materially different fair value pricing of the gold held by the Trust.

Results of Operations
The Year Ended December 31, 2021(a)
The Trust’s net asset value decreased from $31,918,269,136 at December 31, 2020 to $28,723,023,637 at December 31, 2021, a 10.01% decrease for the year. The decrease in the Trust’s net asset value resulted primarily from a decrease in the number of outstanding Shares, which fell from 885,225,000 at December 31, 2020 to 829,750,000 at December 31, 2021, a consequence of 53,075,000 Shares (1,062 Baskets) being created and 108,550,000 Shares (2,171 Baskets) being redeemed during the year. The decrease in the Trust’s net asset value was also affected by a decrease in the LBMA Gold Price, which fell 3.75% from $1,891.10 at December 31, 2020 to $1,820.10 at December 31, 2021. The Board of Directors authorized a one-for-two reverse stock split for the Trust, effective at the market open on May 24, 2021. The impact of the stock split was to raise the NAV by a factor of two and decrease the shares outstanding, resulting in no effect on the net assets of the Trust. The financial statements for the Trust have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.
The 3.99% decrease in the NAV from $36.06 at December 31, 2020 to $34.62 at December 31, 2021 is directly related to the 3.75% decrease in the price of gold.
The NAV decreased slightly more than the price of gold on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor’s fees, which were $72,773,331 for the year, or 0.25% of the Trust’s average weighted assets of $29,100,578,209 during the year. The NAV of $37.04 on January 4, 2021 was the highest during the year, compared with a low of $32.08 on March 30, 2021.
Net decrease in net assets resulting from operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1,399,133,475, resulting from an unrealized loss on investment in gold bullion of $1,904,612,983 and a net investment loss of $72,773,331, partially offset by a net realized gain of $565,428,591 on gold bullion distributed for the redemption of Shares and a net realized gain of $12,824,248 from gold bullion sold to pay expenses during the year. Other than the Sponsor’s fees of $72,773,331, the Trust had no expenses during the year.

The increase in the Trust’s net asset value resulted primarily from an increase in the number of outstanding Shares, which rose from 605,575,000 at December 31, 2019 to 885,225,000 at December 31, 2020, a consequence of 359,650,000 Shares (7,193 Baskets) being created and 80,000,000 Shares (1,600 Baskets) being redeemed during the year. The increase in the Trust’s net asset value also benefited from an increase in the LBMA Gold Price, which rose 24.16% from $1,523.00 at December 31, 2019 to $1,891.10 at December 31, 2020.
The 23.83% rise in the NAV from $29.12 at December 31, 2019 to $36.06 at December 31, 2020 was directly related to the 24.16% increase in the price of gold.
