Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CIVIL AUTHORITY ACTIONS ON OUR BUSINESS
On February 25, 2020, the City of San Francisco issued the proclamation by the Mayor declaring the existence of a local emergency. The negative effects of the civil authority actions related to the novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) on our business have been significant. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious virus, which has continued to spread, has adversely affected workforces, customers, economies, and financial markets globally. It has also disrupted the normal operations of many businesses, including ours. To mitigate the harm from the pandemic, on March 16, 2020, the City and County of San Francisco, along with a group of five other Bay Area counties and the City of Berkeley, issued parallel health officer orders imposing shelter in place limitations across the Bay Area, requiring everyone to stay safe at home except for certain essential needs. Since February 2020, several unfavorable events and civil authority actions have unfolded causing demand for our hotel rooms to suffer including cancellations of all citywide conventions, reduction of flights in and out of the Bay Area and decline in both leisure and business travel.
In December 2020, due to the surge in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, the Health Officer of the City and County of San Francisco suspended or restricted certain activities. Health Order C19-07q (the “Order”) incorporates suspensions, reductions in capacity limits, and other restrictions contained in the Regional Stay At Home Order issued by the California Department of Public Health on December 3, 2020. Effective December 17, 2020, the Bay Area Region, including San Francisco, was required to comply with the State’s December 3, 2020 Regional Stay-at-Home Order. The Order strongly discouraged anyone in the County from travelling for leisure, recreation, business, or other purposes that could be postponed until after the surge. With limited exceptions, this Order imposed a mandatory quarantine on anyone traveling, moving, or returning to the County from anywhere outside the Bay Area. Effective January 20, 2021, Health Order C19- 07r revised and replaced the previous Order; it continued to temporarily prohibit certain businesses and activities from resuming but allowed certain other businesses, activities, travel, and governmental functions to occur subject to specified health and safety restrictions, limitations, and conditions to limit the transmission of COVID-19.
On March 24, 2021, the City and County of San Francisco announced it moved into the orange tier which removed the suggested Shelter in Place for guests travelling to San Francisco. This was a very positive step for the hotel community. This tier opened activities in the city including expanded restaurant capacities, museums, and attractions. For the hotel it allowed for guests to gather in public spaces and for outlets and amenities to open at limited capacities including fitness centers. It did not change the very stringent cleaning and sanitation requirements set forth by the Health Officer of the City and County of San Francisco which proved to be a costly measure to maintain. Effective May 6, 2021, the City and County of San Francisco moved into the yellow tier guidelines. We continue to closely monitor the very fluid changes that the Center for Disease Control, San Francisco Department of Health and other authorities implement with regards to the COVID-19 pandemic.
On August 20, 2021, San Francisco announced vaccination requirements for indoor activities. This order requires restaurants, theaters, and entertainment venues where food or drink is served inside, as well as gyms, recreation facilities, yoga studios, dance studios and other fitness establishments, clubs involving elevated breathing to show proof of vaccination.
On January 11, 2022, a new Health Order has been issued. The primary change to the Order is to comply with changes the State made lowering the threshold for mega events to 500 attendees indoor and 5,000 attendees outdoor beginning January 15, 2022. On March 17, 2022, the State of California announced that beginning on April 1, 2022, it will no longer require that people attending Indoor Mega-Event (i.e., events with 1,000 or more attendees) provide proof of vaccination or negative testing to gain entry. Instead, the State strongly recommend that venues hosting Indoor Mega-Events continue to impose that requirement.
The San Francisco hospitality market has seen the two largest citywide events go virtual with DreamForce in September 2021 and JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in January 2022. RSA Conference originally scheduled for February 2022 was moved to June 2022 and Google Cloud Next was cancelled for 2022. As of the date of this report, the market is seeing slow and steady improvement month over month. Rates in the market grew roughly 20% from February 2022 to March 2022 as demand is steadily increasing, particularly midweek where it has been the softest. Demand generators are returning to the market with the largest being Game Developers Conference in March 2022. Although it was approximately half of the pre-COVID attendance, it lifted the market to the best RevPAR we have seen since March 2020. . April 2022 continued the trend with midweek rates rising and another strong performance from the RIMS citywide. May was another strong month with increasing leisure demand and another successful citywide in American Thoracic Society, RevPAR grew 10% month over month. June was the strongest month since the pandemic with rates growing $35 almost 15% just from the previous month driven by strong summer travel and the most successful citywide since the pandemic began in RSA. The hotel achieved a significant benchmark breaking the $4MM mark in total revenues for the first time since January of 2020. July and August 2022 performed strong as well as we closed out the expected demand from summer travel along with an increase in much needed Business Travel and small groups to the hotel.
As a result of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) signed into law on March 27, 2020, additional avenues of relief may be available to workers and families through enhanced unemployment insurance provisions and to small businesses through programs administered by the Small Business Administration (“SBA”). The CARES Act includes, among other things, provisions relating to payroll tax credits and deferrals, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credits and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. The CARES Act also established a Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), whereby certain small businesses are eligible for a loan to fund payroll expenses, rent, and related costs. On April 9, 2020, Justice entered into a loan agreement (“SBA Loan - Justice”) with CIBC Bank USA under the CARES Act. Justice received proceeds of $4,719,000 from the SBA Loan - Justice. In accordance with the requirements of the CARES Act, Justice has used all proceeds from the SBA Loan for payroll costs and other qualified expenses. The SBA Loan - Justice was scheduled to mature on April 9, 2022 and had a 1.00% interest rate and was subject to the terms and conditions applicable to loans administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration under the CARES Act. On April 27, 2020, InterGroup entered into a loan agreement (“SBA Loan - InterGroup”) with CIBC Bank USA under the CARES Act and received loan proceeds in the amount of $453,000. InterGroup used all the $453,000 loan proceeds in qualified payroll expenses. The SBA Loan - InterGroup was scheduled to mature on April 27, 2022 and had a 1.00% interest rate. Both the SBA Loan - Justice and SBA Loan - InterGroup (collectively the “SBA Loans”) were forgiven in full by the SBA during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021 and $5,172,000 was recorded as gain on debt extinguishment on the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.
On February 3, 2021, Justice entered into a second loan agreement (“Second SBA Loan”) with CIBC Bank USA administered by the SBA. Justice received proceeds of $2,000,000 from the Second SBA Loan. As of June 30, 2021, Justice used all proceeds from the Second SBA Loan primarily for payroll costs. The Second SBA Loan was scheduled to mature on February 3, 2026, had a 1.00% interest rate, and was subject to the terms and conditions applicable to loans administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration under the CARES Act. On November 19, 2021, the Second SBA Loan was forgiven in full and $2,000,000 was recorded as gain on debt extinguishment on the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
As of June 30, 2022, the Company owned approximately 75.0% of the common shares of Portsmouth Square, Inc.

Portsmouth’s primary asset is a 544-room hotel property located at 750 Kearny Street, San Francisco, California 94108, known as the “Hilton San Francisco Financial District” (the “Hotel” or the “Property”) and related facilities, including a five-level underground parking garage. The financial statements of Portsmouth have been consolidated with those of the Company.
In addition to the operations of the Hotel, the Company also generates income from the ownership and management of its real estate. Properties include sixteen apartment complexes, one commercial real estate property, and three single-family houses as strategic investments. The properties are located throughout the United States, but are concentrated in Texas and Southern California. The Company also has an investment in unimproved real property in Hawaii.

Hotel Operations
The Company had net loss of $2,776,000 from Hotel operations for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to net loss of $7,450,000 for the year ended June 30, 2021. The change was primarily attributable to the $16,866,000 increase in Hotel revenue, offset by the $9,540,000 increase in operating expenses.
The following table sets forth a more detailed presentation of Hotel operations for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.
For the year ended June 30, 2022, the Hotel had operating income of $4,083,000 before non-recurring charges, interest, depreciation, and amortization on total operating revenues of $31,534,000 compared to operating loss of $3,243,000 before non-recurring charges, interest, depreciation, and amortization on total operating revenues of $14,668,000 for the year ended June 30, 2021.

The year over year increase in all areas are result of recovery from the business interruption attributable to a variety of responses by federal, state, and local civil authority to the COVID-19 outbreak since March 2020.
The following table sets forth the monthly average occupancy percentage of the Hotel for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.
Total operating expenses increased by $9,540,000 due to increase in salaries and wages, union health insurance, repairs and maintenance, credit card fees, management fees, and franchise fees.
The following table sets forth the average daily room rate, average occupancy percentage and room revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) of the Hotel for the year ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.

The Hotel has taken advantage of the softer demand to take on many improvement projects. We have replaced the wall vinyl in several areas in the lobby and replaced all the art to represent more of the iconic locations in San Francisco. All lobby and restaurant rugs have been replaced and all public restrooms on the first four floors have new vinyl. The Hotel has replaced most of the vinyl in the common areas of the meeting floors and will complete the meeting rooms by September 2022. All guest room carpet has been replaced and a new revised model room that has been valued engineered has been presented to the Hilton design team and is expected to be completed by mid-year 2023. Project to repurpose the old Justice offices, accounting offices, Spa, and Executive Lounge has begun which would add 15 additional income producing guest rooms to our inventory. Part of the renovation will be funded by the Hotel’s furniture, fixture, and equipment reserve account with our senior lender.
Real Estate Operations
Revenue from real estate operations increased to $15,685,000 for the year ended June 30, 2022 from $13,990,000 for the year ended June 30, 2021 primarily due to $935,000 reduction in delinquent rents and $581,000 increase in gross potential rent as a result of higher rental rates and higher occupancy. Real estate operating expenses increased to $8,694,000 from $7,869,000 primarily due to increased administrative expenses, salary expense, insurance expense, and painting - contract labor. Management continues to review and analyze the Company’s real estate operations to improve occupancy and rental rates and to reduce expenses and improve efficiencies.

Gains and losses on marketable securities may fluctuate significantly from period to period in the future and could have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations. However, the amount of gain or loss on marketable securities for any given period may have no predictive value and variations in amount from period to period may have no analytical value. For a more detailed description of the composition of the Company’s marketable securities see the Marketable Securities section below.
During the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company performed an impairment analysis of its other investments and determined that its investments had other than temporary impairment and recorded impairment losses of $41,000 and $119,000, respectively.
The Company and its subsidiary Portsmouth, compute and file income tax returns and prepare discrete income tax provisions for financial reporting.

The following table shows the net (loss) gain on the Company’s marketable securities and the associated margin interest and trading expenses for the respective years.
FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL SOURCES
Historically, our cash flows have been primarily generated from our Hotel and real estate operations. However, the responses by federal, state, and local civil authorities to the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a material detrimental impact on our liquidity. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, our net cash flow provided by operations was $921,000 . We have taken several steps to preserve capital and increase liquidity at our Hotel, including implementing strict cost management measures to eliminate non-essential expenses, postponing capital expenditures, renegotiating certain reoccurring expenses, and temporarily closing certain hotel services and outlets.
The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $14,367,000 and $6,808,000 as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company had restricted cash of $8,982,000 and $8,584,000 as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

During the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, we completed refinancing on six of our California properties and generated net proceeds of $6,762,000. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, we refinanced six of our properties’ existing mortgages and obtained a mortgage note payable on one of our California properties, generating net proceeds totaling $16,683,000. We are currently evaluating other refinancing opportunities and we could refinance additional multifamily properties should the need arise, or should management consider the interest rate environment favorable. The Company had an uncollateralized $5,000,000 revolving line of credit (“LOC”) from CIBC Bank USA (“CIBC”) and the entire $5,000,000 was available to be drawn down as of June 30, 2022 should additional liquidity be necessary. In July 2022, the Company renewed the LOC for a reduced amount of $2,000,000 and is available in its entirety.
On April 9, 2020, Justice entered into a loan agreement (“SBA Loan”) with CIBC Bank USA under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”). Justice received proceeds of $4,719,000 from the SBA Loan. In accordance with the requirements of the CARES Act, Justice used the proceeds from the SBA Loan for payroll costs and other qualified expenses. The SBA Loan was scheduled to mature on April 9, 2022 with a 1.00% interest rate and was subject to the terms and conditions applicable to loans administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration under the CARES Act. On June 10, 2021, the SBA Loan was forgiven in full and $4,719,000 was recorded as gain on debt extinguishment on the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021.
On April 27, 2020, InterGroup entered into a loan agreement (“SBA Loan - InterGroup”) with CIBC Bank USA under the CARES Act and received loan proceeds in the amount of $453,000. InterGroup used all the $453,000 loan proceeds in qualified payroll expenses. The SBA Loan - InterGroup was scheduled to mature on April 27, 2022 and had a 1.00% interest rate. On March 17, 2021, SBA Loan - InterGroup was forgiven in full and $453,000 was recorded as gain on debt extinguishment on the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021.
On February 3, 2021, Justice entered into a second loan agreement (“Second SBA Loan”) with CIBC Bank USA administered by the SBA. Justice received proceeds of $2,000,000 from the Second SBA Loan. As of June 30, 2021, Justice used all proceeds from the Second SBA Loan primarily for payroll costs. The Second SBA Loan was scheduled to mature on February 3, 2026, had a 1.00% interest rate, and was subject to the terms and conditions applicable to loans administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration under the CARES Act. On November 19, 2021, the Second SBA Loan was forgiven in full and $2,000,000 was recorded as gain on debt extinguishment on the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022.
Our known short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for operating and other expenditures, including management and franchise fees, corporate expenses, payroll and related costs, taxes, interest and principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness, and repairs and maintenance of the Hotel.
Our long-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for scheduled debt maturities and capital improvements of the Hotel and our real estate properties. We will continue to finance our business activities primarily with existing cash, including from the activities described above, and cash generated from our operations. After considering our approach to liquidity and accessing our available sources of cash, we believe that our cash position, after giving effect to the transactions discussed above, will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for operating and other expenditures, including corporate expenses, payroll and related benefits, taxes and compliance costs and other commitments, for at least twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements, even if current levels of low occupancy were to persist. The objectives of our cash management policy are to maintain existing leverage levels and the availability of liquidity, while minimizing operational costs. We believe that our cash on hand, along with other potential sources of liquidity that management may be able to obtain, will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs, as well as our capital lease and debt obligations for at least the next twelve months and beyond. However, there can be no guarantee that management will be successful with its plan.
MATERIAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
The following table provides a summary as of June 30, 2022, the Company’s material financial obligations which also includes interest payments.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
The Company has no material off balance sheet arrangements.
IMPACT OF INFLATION
Hotel room rates are typically impacted by supply and demand factors, not inflation, since rental of a hotel room is usually for a limited number of nights. Room rates can be, and usually are, adjusted to account for inflationary cost increases. Since Aimbridge has the power and ability under the terms of its management agreement to adjust hotel room rates on an ongoing basis, there should be minimal impact on partnership revenues due to inflation. Partnership revenues are also subject to interest rate risks, which may be influenced by inflation. For the two most recent fiscal years, the impact of inflation on the Company’s income is not viewed by management as material.
The Company’s residential rental properties provide income from short-term operating leases and no lease extends beyond one year. Rental increases are expected to offset anticipated increased property operating expenses.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Critical accounting policies are those that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require judgments by management in order to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to the consolidation of our subsidiaries, to our revenues, allowances for bad debts, accruals, asset impairments, other investments, income taxes and commitments and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. The actual results may differ from these estimates, or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.
