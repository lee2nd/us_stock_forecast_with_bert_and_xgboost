Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Cannabis Suisse Corp. developed an IT product called Cannabis Life. It is a mobile application based on an AI-chatbot that will have access to the most up-to-date information and find out data about companies and brands that sell seeds, cannabis types, etc.
Cannabis Life is an innovative way of searching and learning any cannabis related data. Using the most relevant sources of today, the app will keep its users up with the trends and tendencies of cannabis industry. Communicating with the chatbot will be as smooth as it would be with a real human being thus giving users additional immersion into the learning process.
As of May 31, 2022, we had no operations and were no longer involved with any aspect of the cannabis business.

Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.
