Forward-looking Statements
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects” and similar references to future periods. These statements may include projections of revenue, provisions for doubtful accounts, income or loss, capital expenditures, repayment of debt, other financial items, statements regarding our plans and objectives for future operations, acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions, statements of future economic performance, statements of the assumptions underlying or relating to any of the foregoing statements and statements other than statements of historical fact.
Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncer-tainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. We therefore caution you against relying on any of these forward-looking statements because they are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include our services and pricing, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, general economic conditions, our ability to raise additional capital, our ability to obtain the various approvals and permits for the acquisition and operation of FBOs and the other risk factors contained in Item 1A of this report.
Any forward-looking statement made by us in this report speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.
Overview
Saker Aviation Services, Inc. is a Nevada corporation. Our common stock, $0.03 par value per share (the “common stock”), is quoted on the OTCQB Marketplace (“OTCQB”) under the symbol “SKAS”. Through our subsidiaries, we operate in the aviation services segment of the general aviation industry, in which we serve as the operator of a heliport, a fixed base operation (“FBO”), and as a provider of aircraft maintenance and repair services (“MRO”). FBOs provide ground-based services, such as fueling and aircraft storage for general aviation, commercial and military aircraft, and other miscellaneous services.
We were formed on January 17, 2003 as a proprietorship and were incorporated in Arizona on January 2, 2004. We became a public company as a result of a reverse merger transaction on August 20, 2004 with Shadows Bend Development, Inc., an inactive public Nevada corporation, and subsequently changed our name to FBO Air, Inc. On December 12, 2006, we changed our name to FirstFlight, Inc. On September 2, 2009, we changed our name to Saker Aviation Services, Inc.
Our business activities are carried out as the operator of the Downtown Manhattan (New York) Heliport and as an FBO and MRO at the Garden City (Kansas) Regional Airport.
The Garden City facility became part of our company as a result of our acquisition of the FBO assets of Central Plains Aviation, Inc. in March 2005 and of Aircraft Services, Inc. in October 2016.
Our business activities at the Downtown Manhattan (New York) Heliport facility (the “Heliport”) commenced in November 2008 when we were awarded the Concession Agreement by the City of New York to operate the Heliport, which we assigned to our subsidiary, FirstFlight Heliports, LLC d/b/a Saker Aviation Services (“FFH”).
Throughout 2020 and 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the global and United States economies. Federal, state, and local governments implemented certain travel restrictions, “stay-at-home” orders, and social distancing initiatives which negatively impacted our operations and those of our customers. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 17, 2020, all sightseeing tour operations at the Downtown Manhattan Heliport ceased due to a drop in demand. On July 20, 2020, New York City started Phase 4 of the city’s reopening. Sightseeing tour operators at the heliport restarted operations under this phase. For the period July 20, 2020 through the date of this report, sightseeing tour operators have experienced much lower demand. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a less substantial impact on our operations at our Kansas FBO and MRO.
While we expect the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to adversely impact our business and operations, the full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and related travel advisories and restrictions and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on overall demand for air travel.
Our long-term strategy is to increase our sales through growth within our aviation services operations. To do so, we may expand our geographic reach and product offering through strategic acquisitions and improved market penetration within the markets we serve. We expect that any future acquisitions or product offerings would be to complement and/or augment our current aviation services operations.
If we are able to grow our business as planned, we anticipate that our larger size would provide us with greater buying power from suppliers, resulting in lower costs. We expect that lower costs would allow for a more aggressive pricing policy against some competition. More importantly, we believe that the higher level of customer service offered in our facilities will allow us to draw additional aircraft to our facilities and thus allow us to compete against other FBOs of varying sizes.
Summary Financial Information
The summary financial data set forth below is derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Comparison of Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.
REVENUE
Revenue increased by 53.5 percent to $5,382,565 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared with corresponding prior-year period revenue of $3,506,268.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, revenue associated with services and supply items increased by 44.9 percent to approximately $2,200,000 as compared to approximately $1,500,000 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. This increase was attributable to increased demand for services at our New York location in 2021 compared to the prior year.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, revenue associated with the sale of jet fuel, aviation gasoline and related items increased by 47.6 percent to approximately $2,900,000 as compared to approximately $1,950,000 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. This increase was attributable to the higher volume of gallons of aviation gasoline sold at both our New York and Kansas locations in 2021 compared to the prior year.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, all other revenue increased by 473.2 percent to approximately $334,000 as compared to approximately $58,000 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. This increase was attributable to an increase in non-aeronautical revenue generated at our New York location compared to last year.
GROSS PROFIT
Total gross profit increased 160.3 percent to $2,553,625 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $980,928 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Gross margin was 47.4 percent for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 28.0 percent for the same period in 2020. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2021 was positively impacted by Employee Retention Tax Credits (“ERTC”) due the Company under the CARES Act. These credits were recorded in the second and third quarters of 2021 and offset operating payroll costs by approximately $69,000. The increase in gross profit is also related to higher levels of activity at both our New York and Kansas locations in 2021 as compared to the prior year. The increase in gross margin is related to higher levels of revenue from services and supplies, which generally carry a higher overall gross margin, in 2021 as compared to the prior year.
OPERATING EXPENSE
Selling, General and Administrative
Total selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) were $1,909,132 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $563,071, or 22.8 percent, as compared to the same period in 2020.
SG&A associated with our FBO operations were approximately $1,438,000 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of approximately $427,000, or 22.9 percent, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. SG&A associated with our FBO operations, as a percentage of revenue, was 26.7 percent for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, as compared with 53.2 percent in the corresponding prior year period. The reduction in SG&A was primarily attributable to a reduction in expenses in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to the same period in 2021 as well as ERTC due the Company under the CARES Act. These credits of approximately $154,000 offset SG&A payroll expenses in 2021.
Corporate SG&A was approximately $471,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of approximately $136,000 as compared with the corresponding prior year period. The decrease in Corporate SG&A on a year-over-year basis was largely attributable to a non-recurring write-off of miscellaneous receivables in the second quarter of 2020.
OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)
Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $644,494 as compared to operating loss of $(1,491,276) in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in operating income on a year-over-year basis was driven by the factors described above.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization was approximately $129,000 and $119,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Interest Income and Expense
Interest income was $3,780 and $18,109 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $24,823, as compared to $24,025 in the same period in 2020. The decrease in interest income on a year-over-year basis was due primarily to interest income recorded in 2020 on a receivable that was no longer recorded in 2021
Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangibles
We had $750,000 of goodwill at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Income Tax Expense (Benefit)
Income tax expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 was approximately $202,000, as compared to income tax benefit of $(431,000) in the same period in 2020. The income tax expense is attributable to net income in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to a net loss in the same period in 2020.
Net Income (Loss) Per Share
Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 was $726,184 as compared to net loss of $(1,748,928) in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.
Basic and diluted net income per share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 was $0.71 as compared to basic net loss per share of ($1.71) in 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and restricted cash of $2,446,906 and a working capital surplus of $3,442,031. We generated revenue of $5,382,565 and had net income of $726,184 for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021, cash flows included net cash provided by operating activities of $813,751, net cash used in investing activities of $81,544, and net cash used in financing activities of $184,383.
As disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 21, 2018 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), on March 15, 2018 the Company entered into a loan agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with Key Bank National Association (the “Bank”). The Loan Agreement contains three components: (i) a $2,500,000 acquisition line of credit (the “Key Bank Acquisition Note”); (ii) a $1,000,000 revolving line of credit (the “Key Bank Revolver Note”); and (iii) a $338,481 term loan (the “Key Bank Term Note”). There are currently no amounts outstanding under the Key Bank Term Note.
Proceeds of the Key Bank Acquisition Note were to be disbursed pursuant to a multiple draw demand note dated as of the agreement date, where the Company could, at the discretion of the Bank, borrow up to an aggregate amount of $2,500,000, to be used for the Company’s acquisition of one or more business entities. Until the Change of Terms Agreement, as defined below, the Company was required to make consecutive monthly payments of interest, calculated at a rate per annum equal to one-day LIBOR (adjusted daily) plus 2.75%, on any outstanding principal under the Key Bank Acquisition Note from the date of its issuance through September 15, 2018 (the “Conversion Date”).
At any time through and including the Conversion Date, at the Bank’s discretion, the Company had the opportunity to request that any loan made under the Key Bank Acquisition Note be converted into a term loan to be repaid in full, including accrued interest, by consecutive monthly payments over a 48 month amortization period beginning after the Conversion Date. For any loan that was not converted into a term loan on or before the Conversion Date, the Company would have been required to begin making monthly payments of principal and interest after the Conversion Date, over a 48 month amortization period, after which the remaining unpaid principal and accrued interest would have become due and payable. All loans under the Key Bank Acquisition Note would have, after the Conversion Date, accrued interest at a rate per annum equal to the Bank’s four year cost of funds rate plus 2.5%. As of the Conversion Date, there were no amounts due under the Key Bank Acquisition Note and no amounts had been converted to a term loan.
On October 11, 2018, and as subsequently amended, the Company entered into a new loan agreement with the Bank (as so amended, the “Change of Terms Agreement”) which modified the original terms of the Key Bank Acquisition Note. Under the Change of Terms Agreement, the Company could have continued to, at the discretion of the Bank, borrow up to an aggregate amount of $2,500,000 through September 1, 2021 (the “Maturity Date”), to be used for the Company’s acquisition of one or more business entities. The Change of Terms Agreement required the Company to make consecutive monthly payments of interest on any outstanding principal calculated at a rate per annum equal to 4.25% and was secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets. The entire principal balance, plus all accrued interest, was due in full on the Maturity Date. The Bank notified the Company of its decision to discontinue the Key Bank Acquisition Note, effective June 30, 2021. There are no amounts due under the Changes of Terms Agreement.
The Key Bank Revolver Note, at the discretion of the Bank, provides for the Company to borrow up to $1,000,000 for working capital and general corporate purposes. This revolving line of credit is a demand note with no stated maturity date. Borrowings under the Key Bank Revolver Note will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to one-day LIBOR (adjusted daily) plus 2.75%. The Company is required to make monthly payments of interest on any outstanding principal under the Key Bank Revolver Note and is required to pay the entire balance, including principal and all accrued and unpaid interest and fees, upon demand by the Bank. Any proceeds from the Key Bank Revolver Note would be secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets. As of December 31, 2021, there were no amounts due under the Key Bank Revolver Note.
On August 14, 2020, the Company was granted a loan from the Bank (the “Loan”) in the amount of $304,833, pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) under Division, Title I of the CARES Act, which was enacted March 27, 2020. The Loan, which was in the form of a note dated August 14, 2020, was to mature in August 2025 and bore interest at a rate of 1% per annum and was payable in monthly installments commencing on, or before, October 31, 2021 if not forgiven and legally released. At December 31, 2020, in accordance with FASB ASC 470, Debt, and ASC 405-20, Liabilities - Extinguishment of Liabilities, the Company recorded the cash inflow from the Loan as a liability, and cash flows from financing, pending legal release from the obligation by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“S.B.A.”). The Company used the Loan proceeds for eligible expenses during the covered period and the Loan was forgiven and legally released by the S.B.A. in full in the second quarter of 2021. The Company recorded the forgiveness of the Loan as a gain on extinguishment of debt - PPP Loan.
The Company is party to a Concession Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2008, with the City of New York for the operation of the Downtown Manhattan Heliport (the “Concession Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Concession Agreement, the Company must pay the greater of 18% of the first $5,000,000 in any program year based on cash collected (“Gross Receipts”) and 25% of Gross Receipts in excess of $5,000,000, or minimum annual guaranteed payments.
As disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 5, 2016, the Company and the New York City Economic Development Corporation (the “NYCEDC”) announced new measures to reduce helicopter noise and impacts across New York City (the “Air Tour Agreement”). Under the Air Tour Agreement, the Company has not been allowed to permit its tenant operators to conduct tourist flights from the Downtown Manhattan Heliport on Sundays since April 1, 2016. The Company was also required to ensure that its tenant operators reduce the total allowable number of tourist flights from 2015 levels by 20 percent beginning June 1, 2016, by 40 percent beginning October 1, 2016 and by 50 percent beginning January 1, 2017. The Air Tour Agreement also provided for the minimum annual guarantee payments the Company is required to pay to the City of New York under the Concession Agreement be reduced by 50%, effective January 1, 2017. Additionally, since June 1, 2016, the Company has been required to provide monthly written reports to the NYCEDC and the New York City Council detailing the number of tourist flights conducted out of the Downtown Manhattan Heliport compared to 2015 levels, as well as information on any tour flight that flies over land and/or strays from agreed upon routes. The Air Tour Agreement also extended the Concession Agreement for 30 months, resulting in a new expiration date of April 30, 2021 and gave the City of New York two one-year options to extend the term of the Concession Agreement. The term of the Concession Agreement was subsequently extended by the City through April 30, 2023 by the City’s exercise of both their two one-year option renewals.
The reductions under the Air Tour Agreement have negatively impacted the Company’s business and financial results as well as those of its management company at the Heliport, Empire Aviation which, as previously disclosed, is owned by two children and a grandchild of a former officer and director of the Company. The Company incurred management fees with Empire Aviation of approximately $0 and $144,000 during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Empire Aviation has notified the Company they believe additional fees are due under their management agreement with the New York Heliport for both 2021 and 2020. If the Company is unable to come to an agreement with Empire Aviation regarding amounts due under the agreement, the Company could incur additional expense (See Note 15. Contingent Liabilities). The Company and Empire Aviation had historically contributed to the Helicopter Tourism and Jobs Council (“HTJC”), an association that lobbies on behalf of the helicopter air tour industry, and which had engaged in discussions with the Mayor’s office. The Company has suspended its contributions to HTJC in light of the pandemic. The Company’s former officer and director was also an active participant with HTJC, which is managed by the former officer and director’s grandson.
During the program year that began on May 1, 2020, the City of New York agreed, in recognition of the pandemic’s impact, that the Company could defer payment of minimum guaranteed payments. In April 2021, the City of New York waived the deferred fees through December 31, 2020. In May 2021, the City of New York waived the deferred fees through April 30, 2021 which coincided with the original expiration of the Concession Agreement as amended by the Air Tour Agreement. The Company has worked with the City of New York to address fees to be paid by the Company for the period May 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021. Concession fees in this Form 10-K have been accounted for based on the months abated in 2021 and the City of New York’s acceptance of 18% of monthly Gross Receipts in excess of $100,000 for the period May 2021 through December 2021. Due to the continued reduced activity at the Heliport, the Company is actively working with the City of New York to address fees to be paid to the City of New York in 2022 and through the remainder of the Air Tour Agreement. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred approximately $192,000 and $103,000 in concession fees, respectively, which are recorded in the cost of revenue.
On April 20, 2018, the Company’s Kansas subsidiary entered into a purchase lease with Commerce Bank for a refueling truck (the “Truck Lease”). The Truck Lease commenced on May 1, 2018 and continues for 60 months with a monthly payment of $2,568 and an interest rate of LIBOR plus 416 basis points. At the end of the Truck Lease, the Company’s subsidiary may purchase the vehicle for $1.00.
On January 15, 2019, the Company was issued an unsecured note by one of its customers at the Heliport. The note schedules payments of approximately $276,000 in receivables payable by such customer, had a maturity date of October 31, 2019, as amended, and carries a 7.5% rate of interest. The note payments were to be made in six monthly installments beginning May 31, 2019. The customer’s payments on the note have not met the installment plan and the Company was working on changes to the note when the customer filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in October 2019. In February 2021, the bankruptcy court allowed the customer to convert from a Chapter 11 Bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 Liquidation. Under the Chapter 7 Liquidation, the note will now be treated as a general unsecured claim as opposed to a prioritized payment under the Chapter 11 Bankruptcy to cure the permit default. This change has substantially diminished the Company’s expectation to collect amounts due under the note. Therefore, the Company deemed unpaid principal and accrued interest of approximately $205,000 at December 31, 2020 as uncollectable. The $205,000 was written off to bad debt expense in the fourth quarter of 2020.
As disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 6, 2015, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement, dated June 30, 2015, by and between the Company and Warren A. Peck, pursuant to which Mr. Peck purchased all of the capital stock of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Phoenix Rising Aviation, Inc. The details of the agreement are described in such Current Report as well as in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was filed with the SEC on April 11, 2016. The Company received $100,000 due under this agreement in September 2017 and an additional payment of $100,000 in September 2018. In 2019, the Company accepted the title to a Falcon 10 aircraft owned by Mr. Peck as satisfaction in full of the remainder of the $270,000 stock purchase price. The Company intended to sell the aircraft and classified it as “Held For Sale” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019. The Company has been unable to find a buyer due to a depressed market as well as a drop in demand for this type of aircraft. Without a market in which to sell the aircraft, the Company recorded an impairment charge in the quarter ended June 30, 2020 for the full carrying amount of the aircraft. The Company does not believe the aircraft has any value and, in December 2020, filed an application with the FAA Aircraft Registry to cancel the aircraft’s registry.
On May 1, 2021, the Company’s Kansas subsidiary executed a promissory note for $76,000 with Avfuel Corporation (“Avfuel”) for the purchase of a Jet-A refueling truck (the “Truck Note”). The Truck Note requires six annual payments of $13,432.56 commencing April 30, 2022 with the entire balance of unpaid principal and interest due on, or before, April 30, 2028. Interest accrues at prime plus 3% on the outstanding principal amount. The Company is required to make prepayments against the Truck Note at the rate of $0.018 per gallon of fuel purchased under a fuel supply agreement between the Company and Avfuel.
As described throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, on March 17, 2020, all sightseeing tour operations at the Downtown Manhattan Heliport ceased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. On July 20, 2020, New York City began Phase 4 of the city’s reopening. Sightseeing tours resumed under this phase. Sightseeing tour operators have experienced low demand and minimal activity since July 20, 2020, but sightseeing tour operators have seen an uptick in demand in the second quarter of 2021 through the date of this report. To mitigate this loss of revenue, we may need additional financing to continue operations through the issuance of equity or debt and any such financing will be dependent on general market conditions, which itself is subject to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we have access to the Key Bank Revolver Note described above, we can make no assurance that that the Key Bank Revolver Note will be sufficient to fund our operations. Additionally, certain restrictions in the Key Bank Revolver Note may prohibit us from obtaining more attractive financing.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we had a net increase in cash of $547,824. Our sources and uses of funds during this period were as follows:
Cash from Operating Activities

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities in which we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligations under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those estimates related to product returns, product and content development expenses, bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
The critical accounting policies which we believe affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are provided as follows:
Accounts Receivable
In 2020, the Company’s accounts receivable was comprised of four customers at our New York Heliport. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, two of these customers were unable to sustain their business and ceased operating in 2020. Their receivable balances at December 31, 2020, totaling approximately $208,000, have been deemed uncollectable by the Company and have been written off to bad debt expense in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Company’s remaining two customers at our New York Heliport continue to operate, but at substantially reduced levels of operation. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, these remaining two customers represented approximately $137,000, or 52.4% of the balance of accounts receivable. No customer represented more than 10% of revenue in 2020. The Company has a security deposit in place in connection with both of these receivables. Accounts receivable amounted to $678,045 at December 31, 2019.
In 2021, the Company’s accounts receivable was comprised of its two customers at our New York Heliport. These customers continued to operate throughout 2021, but at substantially reduced levels of operation when compared to pre-pandemic levels. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, these two customers represented approximately $180,000, or 59.8%, of the balance of accounts receivable. In addition, these two customers represented approximately 27.6% of our revenue in 2021. The Company has a security deposit in place in connection with both of these receivables. In March 2022, one of the Company’s former customers resumed operations. The Company has a security deposit in place with this key customer.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill and intangibles that are deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but, instead, are to be reviewed at each reporting period for impairment. We assessed potential impairment of goodwill using qualitative factors by considering various factors including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, a sustained share price or market capitalization decrease and any reporting unit specific events. We performed an analysis of our goodwill and intangible assets at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between their financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Deferred tax assets are subject to a valuation allowance because it is more likely than not that certain of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. During 2020 we experienced a decrease in demand and minimal activity in our business. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance cannot be predicted and will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, related travel advisories and restrictions. Accordingly, we have established a valuation allowance on net deferred assets. We file income tax returns in the United States (federal) and in various state and local jurisdictions. In most instances, we are no longer subject to federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2018.
Stock Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards are based on the estimated grant-date fair value. We recognize these compensation costs over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the option vesting term.
Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the option. Because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.
