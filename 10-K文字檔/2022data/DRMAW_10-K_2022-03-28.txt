ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of this report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. References in the following discussion to “we”, “our”, “us”, “Dermata”, or “the Company”, refer to Dermata Therapeutics, Inc. formerly known as Dermata Therapeutics, LLC.
Overview
We are a clinical stage medical dermatology company focused on identifying, developing, and commercializing innovative pharmaceutical product candidates for the treatment of medical and aesthetic skin conditions and diseases we believe have significant unmet needs.
Dermatological diseases such as acne vulgaris (or acne), psoriasis vulgaris (or psoriasis), papulopustular rosacea (or rosacea), hyperhidrosis, and various aesthetic indications affect millions of people worldwide each year and may negatively impact their quality of life and emotional well-being. While there are multiple current treatment options for these indications on the market, we believe that most have significant drawbacks, including underwhelming treatment results, cumbersome application regimens and varying negative side effects leading to a lack of patient compliance. While a majority of these indications are first treated with topical products, many patients frequently switch treatments or discontinue treatment altogether due to patient dissatisfaction with slow and modest response rates, early onset of negative side effects, onerous application schedules and typically long duration of therapy. For diseases like psoriasis, a small percentage of patients may be candidates for biologic or systemic therapies, but these patients are typically required to try topical or oral treatment options prior to qualifying for these expensive systemic therapies. Given the limitations with current topical therapies and the restricted usability of systemic therapies, we believe there is a significant opportunity to address the needs of frustrated patients searching for effective topical products that satisfy their dermatological and lifestyle needs.
Our two product candidates, DMT310 and DMT410, incorporate our proprietary, multifaceted, Spongilla technology to topically treat a variety of dermatological conditions. Our Spongilla technology is a multifactorial, naturally derived product that is processed from a wholly naturally grown freshwater sponge, Spongilla lacustris or Spongilla, which is processed into a powder and is mixed with a fluidizing agent immediately prior to application by the patient to form an easily applicable paste. Spongilla is a unique freshwater sponge that only grows in commercial quantities in select regions of the world and under specific environmental conditions, all of which give it its distinctive anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, and mechanical properties. The combination of these ideal environmental conditions, the proprietary harvesting protocols developed with our supplier, and our post-harvest processing procedures optimize the mechanical component as well as the chemical components of Spongilla for product candidates with multiple mechanisms of action for the treatment of inflammatory skin conditions.
Our lead product candidate DMT310, utilizes our Spongilla technology for a once weekly treatment of a variety of skin diseases. Our initial focus is the treatment of acne vulgaris. However, due to the multiple mechanisms of action and anti-inflammatory effect seen with DMT310, we have moved into clinical trials of two additional indications, psoriasis and rosacea. In October 2021, we completed a Phase 1b proof of concept, or POC, trial in psoriasis and in November 2021 we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of DMT310 for the treatment of rosacea.
Our second product candidate utilizing our Spongilla technology is our combination treatment, DMT410. DMT410 consists of one treatment of our proprietary sponge powder followed by topical application of botulinum toxin for delivery into the dermis. We first tested this program in a Phase 1 POC trial of axillary hyperhidrosis patients, which was completed in July 2019. We reported that 80% of patients achieved a reduction in gravimetric sweat production greater than 50%, four weeks after treatment. Based on the results of this trial, we initiated a Phase 1 POC trial of DMT410 for the intradermal treatment of multiple aesthetic skin conditions. In November 2021, we announced top-line results from this trial where we obtained data that we believe warrants further investigation of this program. We believe these two DMT410 trials indicate we have been able to topically deliver botulinum toxin into the dermis after the application of our Spongilla technology.
We believe our Spongilla technology platform will enable us to develop and formulate singular and combination products that are able to target topical delivery of chemical compounds into the dermis for maximum treatment effect for a variety of inflammatory skin diseases. One mechanism of our technology is its mechanical ability to allow for the intradermal delivery of a variety of large and small molecules through microchannels to a targeted treatment site via topical application. In addition to its mechanical components, the Spongilla technology also utilizes multiple naturally occurring chemical compounds that we believe have demonstrated in-vitro anti-microbial, and anti-inflammatory properties. We believe the combination of these mechanical and chemical components make our platform versatile for the treatment of a wide variety of medical and aesthetic skin conditions and diseases.
We have a limited operating history. Since our inception, our operations have focused on developing DMT310 and DMT410, organizing and staffing our company, raising capital, establishing our supply chain and manufacturing processes, further characterizing the multiple mechanisms of action of our Spongilla technology, building an intellectual property portfolio, and conducting non-clinical and clinical trials. We do not have any product candidates approved for marketing and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of our equity securities and debt securities. Since inception, we have raised an aggregate of approximately $46.9 million of gross proceeds from the sale of our debt and equity securities, including the securities sold in our IPO.
We have not generated any revenue to date and have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $7.9 million and $3.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and as of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $36 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:
·
complete development of DMT310 for the treatment of acne, including non-clinical studies and Phase 3 clinical trials;
·
prepare and file for regulatory approval of DMT310 for the treatment of moderate to severe acne;
·
continue development of DMT310 for the treatment of rosacea, including a Phase 2 clinical trial and Phase 3 clinical trials;
·
continue development of DMT310 for the treatment of psoriasis, including a Phase 2 clinical trial and Phase 3 clinical trials;
·
identify a botulinum toxin partner for DMT410 for the treatment of aesthetic and medical skin conditions;
·
prepare for commercialization of DMT310, if approved, including the hiring of sales and marketing personnel;
·
begin to manufacture our product candidates for Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials and commercial sale;
·
hire additional research and development and selling, general and administrative personnel;
·
maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and
·
incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.
We will need additional financing to support our operations. We may seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, and we may never do so.
COVID-19 Update
In December 2019, there was an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The current COVID-19 pandemic has presented a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting our employees, patients, communities and business operations, as well as the U.S. economy and financial markets. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions taken to contain it or mitigate its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets. Our assessment to date continues to support that we have not experienced any material delays or significant financial impacts directly related to the pandemic other than some minor disruptions to preclinical studies and clinical operations, including some disruptions in our manufacturing supply chain that affected and may continue to affect our drug supply, patient enrollment in some of our clinical trials and delays in collecting, receiving and analyzing data from patients enrolled in our clinical trials for DMT310 due to limited staff at our clinical trial sites. We will continue to monitor the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, liquidity, assets and operations, including our personnel, programs, expected timelines, expenses, third-party contract manufacturing, contract research organizations and clinical trials.
While our third-party contract manufacturers have been operating at or near normal levels and while we have not experienced any major interruptions to our contract manufacturers’ processes, it is possible that the pandemic and response efforts may have an impact in the future on our third-party contract manufacturers’ ability to produce quantities of our product candidates for preclinical testing and clinical trials. In addition, we rely on contract research organizations or other third parties to assist us with clinical trials, and we cannot guarantee that they will continue to perform their contractual duties in a timely and satisfactory manner as a result of the pandemic. Certain of our clinical trial sites have experienced, and others may experience in the future, delays in collecting, receiving and analyzing data from patients enrolled in our clinical trials for due to limited staff at such sites, limitation or suspension of on-site visits by patients, or patients’ reluctance to visit the clinical trial sites during the pandemic. We and our contract research organizations may also need to make certain adjustments to the operation of our clinical trials in an effort to ensure the monitoring and safety of patients and minimize risk to trial integrity during the pandemic and generally.
We have taken temporary precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, including having all of our employees to work remotely, suspending all non-essential travel worldwide for our employees and discouraging employee attendance at industry events and in-person work-related meetings, which could negatively affect our business. We cannot presently predict the scope and severity of the planned and potential shutdowns or disruptions of businesses and government agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, or FDA.
Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
We have not generated any revenue since inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future until we obtain regulatory approval of, and commercialize, our product candidates.
Operating Expenses
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of late-stage clinical trials. We expect research and development costs to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as our pipeline of product candidates progress further into clinical trials. However, we do not believe it is possible at this time to accurately project total program- related expenses to reach commercialization based on numerous factors. In addition, there are numerous unknown expenses related to the commercialization of our product candidates including continued regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time.
Research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with the development of our product candidates. We expense development costs as incurred. These expenses include:
·
expenses incurred under agreements with CROs, as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and preclinical studies;
·
manufacturing and supply scale-up expenses and the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical and clinical trial supply and commercial supply, including manufacturing validation batches; and
·
outsourced laboratory services, including materials and supplies used to support our research and development activities, including payments made for license fees and milestone payments.
The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of, or when, if ever, material net cash inflows may commence from our product candidates. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials, which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of many factors, including:
·
the number of clinical sites included in the clinical trials;
·
the length of time required to enroll suitable patients;
·
the size of patient populations participating in the clinical trials;
·
the number of doses a patient receives;
·
the duration of patient follow-ups;
·
the development state of the product candidates; and
·
the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidates.
Our expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties, including the terms and timing of regulatory approvals, and the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending, and enforcing any patent claims or other intellectual property rights. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates. We may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials. We may elect to discontinue, delay, or modify clinical trials of our product candidates. A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or other regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. Product commercialization will take several years and millions of dollars in development costs.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive and administrative functions, travel expenses and recruiting expenses. Other general and administrative expenses include stock based compensation expenses, professional fees for legal, accounting and tax related services, insurance costs, as well as payments made to consultants. We expense all general and administrative expenses as incurred.
We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase as a result of increased payroll, expanded infrastructure and higher consulting, legal and tax related services associated with maintaining compliance with stock exchange listing and SEC requirements, accounting and investor relations costs, and director and officer insurance premiums associated with being a public company. As a result, we expect to report higher general and administrative expenses in 2022.
Interest Expense
Interest expense has consisted primarily of interest expense on our previously outstanding convertible debt and loan with Silicon Valley Bank, amortization of debt discount costs, and interest on milestone payments under the License Amendment and Settlement Agreement.
Income Taxes
From inception until March 24, 2021, we operated as a limited liability company taxed as a partnership. Therefore, any income tax liability or benefit through that date accrued to our members. Since March 24, 2021, we have operated as a C-Corporation and account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
We recognize net deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our recorded net amount, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.
We record uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) management determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, management recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, within income tax expense. Any accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
We have based our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to clinical development expenses and the fair value of units and common stock. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements.
Research and Development Expenses
As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to record actual research and development expenses and to estimate accrued research and development expenses, current assets, and other current liabilities. This process involves reviewing open contracts and commitments, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed for us and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued research and development expenses, current assets, and other current liabilities as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Example of estimated accrued research and development expenses, prepaid assets, and other current liabilities include fees paid to contract manufacturers made in connection with the manufacturing of clinical trials materials and contract research organizations made in connection the performance of clinical trials on our behalf.
We base our expenses related to clinical manufacturing and clinical trials on our estimates of the services performed pursuant to contracts with the entities performing those services on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract, and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under these types of contracts depend heavily upon the successful completion of many separate tasks involved in the manufacturing of drug product and the performance of clinical trials. In the case of clinical trials, a portion of the estimated cost normally relates to the projected cost to treat a patient in the trials, and this cost is recognized based on the number of patients enrolled in the trial. Other indirect costs are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of the study. As actual costs become known to us, we adjust our accruals. To date, our estimates have not differed materially from the actual costs incurred. However, subsequent changes in estimates may result in a material change in our accruals, which could also materially affect our balance sheet and results of operations.
We accrue and expense clinical trial activities performed by third parties based upon estimates of the proportion of work completed over the life of the individual clinical trial and patient enrollment rates in accordance with agreements established with clinical research organizations (“CROs”) and clinical trial sites. We determine the estimates by reviewing contracts, vendor agreements and purchase orders, and through discussions with internal clinical personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services. However, actual costs and timing of clinical trials are highly uncertain, subject to risks and may change depending upon a number of factors, including our clinical development plan.
We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services, including fees for process development or manufacturing and distribution of clinical supplies that will be used in future research and development activities, are deferred and recognized as expense in the period that the related goods are consumed or services are performed.
Fair Value of Common Stock and Stock-based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The company’s policy permits the valuation of stock-based awards granted to non-employees to be measured at fair value at the grant date.
Determining the appropriate fair value of share-based awards requires the use of subjective assumptions, including the fair value of our common shares for awards prior to our IPO, and for options, the expected life of the option and expected share price volatility. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our option awards. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represents our best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and management uses different assumptions, share-based compensation expense could be materially different for future awards.
Prior to our initial public offering in August 2021, we were required to periodically estimate the fair value of our common stock when issuing stock options and computing their estimated stock-based compensation expense. The fair value of common stock was determined by management on a periodic basis, with the assistance of an independent third party valuation firm. The assumptions underlying these valuations represented management’s best estimates, which involved inherent uncertainties and the application of significant levels of management judgment.
In order to determine the fair value, we considered, among other things, contemporaneous transactions involving the sale of our common stock to unrelated third parties, the lack of marketability of our common stock and the market performance of comparable publicly traded companies.
Fair Value of Common Units
In the absence of a public trading market for our common units prior to our IPO, on each grant date, we developed an estimate of the fair value of our common units underlying the unit grants. We estimated the fair value of our common units by referencing arm’s length transactions with third parties, inclusive of the common units underlying which occurred on or near the valuation date(s).
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we issued 161,142 Class B Common Units to employees, officers, and directors. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued 2,926 Class B Common Units to consultants and 2,643 Class B Common Units to an employee. All of the Class B Common Units issued in 2019 and 2020 represent a profits interest, as that term is defined in Revenue Procedure 93-27, 1993-2 C.B. 343, as clarified by Revenue Procedure 2001-43, 2001-2 C.B. 191. For performance-based awards, if and when the achievement of the predetermined performance criteria become probable, expense will be recognized. To date unit-based compensation expense has not been material. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of unit-based awards represents management’s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. As a result, if factors change and management uses different assumptions, unit-based compensation expense could be materially different for future awards. All of such securities were exchanged for shares of our capital units in connection with our conversion from a limited liability company to a corporation in March 2021.
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively:
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses increased by $1.9 million from $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was the result of increased salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation of $1.3 million and increased clinical trial and manufacturing costs of $0.6 million.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses increased by $2.8 million from $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase resulted from increased salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation of $1.3 million as well as increased legal, professional, and public company costs of $1.5 million, including increased insurance costs of $0.5 million, resulting from us incurring additional expenses as a public company in 2021.
Other income and expenses
Other income and expenses decreased by $18,064 from $63,677 for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $45,613 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was the result of decreased interest expense of $151,656 offset by the gain from the forgiveness of the Paycheck Protection Plan loan of $133,592.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating and financing activities:
Operating activities
Cash used in operations of $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 was the result of the net loss of $7.9 million and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.7 million, offset by non-cash stock-based compensation of $1.9 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued and other current liabilities of $1.0 million.
Cash used in operations of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was the result of the net loss of $3.2 million, payment of $0.5 million for a license and settlement liability, as well as an increase in accounts payable and accrued and other current liabilities of $0.3 million.
Financing activities
Cash provided by financing activities of $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 was the result of net proceeds of $15.4 million from our initial public offering, $1.6 million from the issuance of convertible subordinated promissory notes, proceeds of $0.6 million from the issuance of Series 1d Preferred Units, offset by $1.0 million payment for the redemption of 5,221,156 shares of Series 1c preferred stock and $0.6 million of principal and final payments on debt.
Cash provided by financing activities of $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was the result of proceeds of $3.0 million from the issuance of convertible subordinated promissory notes, proceeds of $0.3 million from the issuance of Series 1c Preferred Units, and proceeds of $0.1 million from the Paycheck Protection Plan loan, offset by $0.8 million of principal payments on debt.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since our inception, we have not generated any revenue or commercialized any products. As of December 31, 2021, our cash totaled $10.8 million and we had an accumulated deficit of $36 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we used cash of $5.7 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in operations.
Historically, our principal sources of cash have included proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred equity and proceeds from the issuance of debt. Our principal uses of cash have included cash used in operations (including clinical development of our product candidates and general and administrative expenses) and payments for license rights. We expect that the principal uses of cash in the future will be for continuing operations, funding of research and development, and general working capital requirements. We expect that as research and development expenses continue to grow, we will need to raise additional capital to sustain operations and research and development activities.
Future Capital Requirements
We plan to focus in the near term on the development, regulatory approval, and potential commercialization of DMT310 for the treatment of acne, psoriasis, and rosacea. We anticipate we will incur net losses for the next several years as we complete clinical development of DMT310 for the treatment of acne, psoriasis and rosacea and continue research and development of DMT410 for the treatment of aesthetic and medical skin conditions. In addition, we plan to seek opportunities to identify, acquire or in license and develop additional drug candidates, potentially build commercial capabilities, and expand our corporate infrastructure. We may not be able to complete the development and initiate commercialization of these programs if, among other things, our clinical trials are not successful or if the FDA does not approve our drug candidate arising out of our current clinical trials when we expect, or at all.
Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, compensation and related expenses, clinical costs, external research and development services, legal and other regulatory expenses, and administrative and overhead costs. Our future funding requirements will be heavily determined by the resources needed to support development of our drug candidates.
As a publicly traded company, we will incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we were not required to incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes- Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules adopted by the SEC and Nasdaq, requires public companies to implement specified corporate governance practices that were not applicable to us as a private company. We expect these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.
We believe that our existing cash will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the fourth quarter of 2022. We have based this estimate of cash runway on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. We will require additional capital to conduct Phase 3 studies for DMT310 for the treatment of acne, and to pursue in licenses or acquisitions of other drug candidates.
Additional funds may not be available on a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at all, and such funds, if raised, may not be sufficient to enable us to continue to implement our long-term business strategy. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital, we may need to substantially curtail our planned operations and the pursuit of our growth strategy.
We may raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities. In such an event, the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of a holder of our common stock.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development, and commercialization of pharmaceutical drugs, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:
·
the number and characteristics of the drug candidates we pursue;
·
the scope, progress, results, and costs of researching and developing our drug candidates, and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials;
·
the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for our drug candidates;
·
the cost of manufacturing our drug candidates and any drugs we successfully commercialize;
·
our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;
·
the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending, and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; and
·
the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or milestone payments related to or royalties on, our current or future drug candidates, if any.
To continue to grow our business over the longer term, we plan to commit substantial resources to research and development, clinical trials of our product candidates, and other operations and potential product acquisitions and in licensing. We have evaluated and expect to continue to evaluate a wide array of strategic transactions as part of our plan to acquire or in license and develop additional products and product candidates to augment our internal development pipeline. Strategic transaction opportunities that we may pursue could materially affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur additional indebtedness, seek equity capital or both. In addition, we may pursue development, acquisition or in licensing of approved or development products in new or existing therapeutic areas or continue the expansion of our existing operations. Accordingly, we expect to continue to opportunistically seek access to additional capital to license or acquire additional products, product candidates or companies to expand our operations, or for general corporate purposes. Strategic transactions may require us to raise additional capital through one or more public or private debt or equity financings or could be structured as a collaboration or partnering arrangement. We have no arrangements, agreements, or understandings in place at the present time to enter into any acquisition, in licensing or similar strategic business transaction.
If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholder will experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms, such as liquidation and other preferences that are not favorable to us or our stockholder. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.
Going Concern
Since inception we have been engaged in organizational activities, including raising capital and research and development activities. We have not generated revenues and have not yet achieved profitable operations, nor have we ever generated positive cash flow from operations. There is no assurance that profitable operations, if achieved, could be sustained on a continuing basis. We are subject to those risks associated with any pre-clinical stage pharmaceutical company that has substantial expenditures for research and development. There can be no assurance that our research and development projects will be successful, that products developed will obtain necessary regulatory approval, or that any approved product will be commercially viable. In addition, we operate in an environment of rapid technological change and is largely dependent on the services of our employees and consultants. Further, our future operations are dependent on the success of the Company’s efforts to raise additional capital. These uncertainties raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for 12 months after the issuance date of our financial statements. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the company to continue as a going concern, which contemplates the continuation of operations, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. We incurred net losses of $7.9 million and $3.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and had an accumulated deficit of $36 million at December 31, 2021. We anticipate incurring additional losses until such time, if ever, that we can generate significant revenue from our product candidates currently in development. Our primary source of capital has been the issuance of debt and equity securities.
Global Pandemic Outbreak
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. The outbreak has become increasingly widespread in the United States, impacting the markets in which we operate. While the full impact of the pandemic continues to evolve, the financial markets have been subject to significant volatility that adversely impacts our ability to enter into, modify, and negotiate favorable terms and conditions relative to equity and debt financing initiatives. The uncertain financial markets, disruptions in supply chains, mobility restraints, and changing priorities as well as volatile asset values also affect our ability to enter into collaborations, joint ventures, and license and royalty agreements. The outbreak and government measures taken in response to the pandemic have also had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as worker shortages have occurred; supply chains have been disrupted; facilities and production have been suspended; and demand for certain goods and services, such as medical services and supplies, have spiked, while demand for other goods and services, such as travel, have fallen. The future progression of the pandemic and its effects on our business and operations are uncertain. We may face difficulties recruiting or retaining patients in our ongoing and planned preclinical and clinical trials if patients are affected by the virus or are fearful of traveling to our clinical trial sites because of the outbreak. We and our third-party contract manufacturers, CROs, and clinical sites may also face disruptions in procuring items that are essential to our research and development activities, including, for example, medical and laboratory supplies used in our clinical trials or preclinical studies, in each case, that are sourced from abroad or for which there are shortages because of ongoing efforts to address the outbreak. While expected to be temporary, these disruptions may negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity in 2022, and potentially beyond.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, please see the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
JOBS Act
On April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for an “emerging growth company”. As an “emerging growth company,” we are electing to take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision not to take advantage of the extended transition period is irrevocable.
Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an “emerging growth company,” we are not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation-related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer’s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply until the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering or until we no longer meet the requirements for being an “emerging growth company,” whichever occurs first.
