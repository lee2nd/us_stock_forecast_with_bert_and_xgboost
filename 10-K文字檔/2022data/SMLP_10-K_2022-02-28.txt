Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
MD&A is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the financial condition and results of operations of the Partnership and its subsidiaries. As a result, the following discussion for the year ended December 31, 2021 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Annual Report. Among other things, the consolidated financial statements and the related notes include more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that constitute our plans, estimates and beliefs. These forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those discussed in Forward-Looking Statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
Overview
We are a value-driven limited partnership focused on developing, owning and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets that are strategically located in unconventional resource basins, primarily shale formations, in the continental United States.
Our financial results are driven primarily by volume throughput across our gathering systems and by expense management. We generate the majority of our revenues from the gathering, compression, treating and processing services that we provide to our customers. A majority of the volumes that we gather, compress, treat and/or process have a fixed-fee rate structure which enhances the stability of our cash flows by providing a revenue stream that is not subject to direct commodity price risk. We also earn a portion of our revenues from the following activities that directly expose us to fluctuations in commodity prices: (i) the sale of physical natural gas and/or NGLs purchased under percentage-of-proceeds or other processing arrangements with certain of our customers in the Rockies, Piceance, and Permian segments, (ii) the sale of natural gas we retain from certain Barnett segment customers, (iii) the sale of condensate we retain from our gathering services in the Piceance segment and (iv) additional gathering fees that are tied to the performance of certain commodity price indexes that which are then added to the fixed gathering rates. During the year ended December 31, 2021, these additional activities accounted for approximately 22% of our total revenues.
We also have indirect exposure to changes in commodity prices in that persistently low commodity prices may cause our customers to delay and/or cancel drilling and/or completion activities or temporarily shut-in production, which would reduce the volumes of natural gas and crude oil (and associated volumes of produced water) that we gather. If certain of our customers cancel or delay drilling and/or completion activities or temporarily shut-in production, the associated MVCs, if any, ensure that we will earn a minimum amount of revenue.
The following table presents certain consolidated and reportable segment financial data. For additional information on our reportable segments, see the “Segment Overview for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020” section herein.

Key Matters for the Year ended December 31, 2021. The following items are reflected in our financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021:
•Refinancing debt obligations with near-term maturities. On November 2, 2021, the Co-Issuers issued $700.0 million of the 2026 Secured Notes. We used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2026 Secured Notes, together with cash on hand and borrowings under the ABL Facility, to repay in full all of Summit Holdings’ obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility. Additionally, the Co-Issuers redeemed all of the outstanding 2022 Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 100.0% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.
•Global Settlement. As previously disclosed, we were the subject of multiple investigations stemming from the 2015 Blacktail Release. On August 4, 2021, we entered into a Global Settlement to resolve these legal matters that includes the payment of penalties and fines of $36.3 million over six years. As a result of the settlement, we recognized an additional loss for this matter during 2021 and had $33.2 million accrued for this matter as of December 31, 2021. See Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements and Item 3. Legal Proceedings for additional information.
•April 2021 Series A Preferred Unit Exchange. In April 2021, the Partnership completed the 2021 Preferred Exchange Offer, whereby it issued 538,715 common units, net of units withheld for withholding taxes, in exchange for 18,662 Series A Preferred Units. Upon settlement of the 2021 Preferred Exchange Offer, the Partnership eliminated $20.7 million of the Series A Preferred Unit liquidation preference amount, inclusive of $2.5 million of accrued distributions due as of the settlement date. See Note 12 - Partners' Capital and Mezzanine Capital for additional information.
•Double E Project. In November 2021, the Partnership placed the Double E Pipeline in service and began recognizing revenue. As a result, our investment in Double E recognized positive equity in earnings from Double E beginning in the quarter ended December 31, 2021. Capital contributions to Double E in 2021 totaled $148.7 million and were funded primarily from our new Permian Transmission Credit Facility and cash on hand.
•Loss on ECP Warrants. On August 5, 2021, the ECP Entities cashlessly exercised all of their ECP Warrants for an aggregate of 414,447 SMLP common units, net of the exercise price, as calculated pursuant to Section 3(c) of the ECP Warrants (the “ECP Warrant Exercise"). During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Partnership recognized a $13.6 million non-cash loss related to the ECP Warrants.
In addition, in January 2022, the Partnership completed the 2022 Preferred Exchange Offer, whereby it issued 2,853,875 SMLP common units, net of units withheld for withholding taxes, in exchange for 77,939 Series A Preferred Units. Upon settlement of the 2022 Preferred Exchange Offer, the Partnership eliminated $92.6 million of the Series A Preferred Unit liquidation preference amount, inclusive of accrued distributions due as of the settlement date.
Key Matters for the Year ended December 31, 2020. The following items are reflected in our financial results for the fiscal year ended 2020:
•GP Buy-In Transaction. In May 2020, the Partnership completed the GP Buy-In Transaction whereby the Partnership acquired from its then private equity sponsor, ECP, (i) Summit Investments, which indirectly owned the Partnership’s General Partner, (ii) through its ownership of SMP Holdings, 3,415,646 of its common units and (iii) a deferred purchase price obligation receivable owed by the Partnership. Consideration paid to ECP included a $35.0 million cash payment and warrants to purchase up to 666,667 common units. In connection with the closing of the GP Buy-In Transaction, ECP’s management resigned from the Board of Directors and fully exited its investment in the Partnership (other than retaining the aforementioned warrants). Refer to Note 1 - Organization, Business Operations and Presentation and Consolidation for details.
•Suspension of common and preferred unit distributions. In May 2020, and in conjunction with the GP Buy-In Transaction, the Partnership suspended distributions to holders of its common units and its Series A Preferred Units, commencing with respect to the quarter ending March 31, 2020. The suspension of distributions enabled the Partnership to retain an incremental $76.0 million per annum of operating cash flow and reallocate this retained cash to indebtedness reduction, liability management transactions and other corporate initiatives. The unpaid cash distributions on the Series A Preferred Units continue to accrue semi-annually, until paid.
•July 2020 Series A Preferred Unit Exchange. In July 2020, the Partnership completed an offer to exchange its Series A Preferred Units for newly issued common units (the “2020 Preferred Exchange Offer”), whereby it issued 837,547 common units in exchange for 62,816 Series A Preferred Units. Upon closing the 2020 Preferred Exchange Offer, it eliminated $66.5 million of the Series A Preferred Unit liquidation preference amount, inclusive of $3.7 million of accrued distributions due as of the settlement date.
•Open Market Repurchase of Senior Notes. Throughout 2020, the Partnership completed multiple open market repurchases of the 2022 Senior Notes and the 2025 Senior Notes (the “Open Market Repurchases”), which resulted in the extinguishment of $32.4 million of face value of the 2022 Senior Notes and $201.8 million of face value of the 2025 Senior Notes. Total cash consideration paid to repurchase the principal amounts outstanding of the 2022 Senior Notes and 2025 Senior Notes, plus accrued interest totaled $150.3 million and the Partnership recognized an $86.4 million gain on the extinguishment of debt related to these Open Market Repurchases during 2020.
•Debt Tender Offers. In September 2020, the Co-Issuers completed the cash tender offers (the “Debt Tender Offers”) to purchase a portion of their 2022 Senior Notes and 2025 Senior Notes. Upon completion of the Debt Tender Offers, the Co-Issuers repurchased $33.5 million principal amount of the 2022 Senior Notes and $38.7 million principal amount of the 2025 Senior Notes. Total cash consideration paid to repurchase the principal amounts outstanding of the 2022 and 2025 Senior Notes, plus accrued interest, totaled $48.7 million, and the Partnership recognized a $23.3 million gain on the extinguishment of debt related to the Debt Tender Offers during 2020.
•TL Restructuring. In November 2020, the Partnership completed the consensual debt discharge and restructuring (the “TL Restructuring”) of SMP Holdings’ $155.2 million term loan (the “SMPH Term Loan”). As part of the TL Restructuring, the Partnership paid SMP Holdings $26.5 million in cash as consideration to fully settle the deferred purchase price obligation, which SMP Holdings then paid to the lenders under the SMPH Term Loan (the “Term Loan Lenders”). In addition, the Term Loan Lenders executed a strict foreclosure on the 2,306,972 common units pledged as collateral under the SMPH Term Loan in full satisfaction of SMP Holdings’ outstanding obligations under the SMPH Term Loan.
•December 2020 Series A Preferred Unit Tender. On December 29, 2020, the Partnership completed a cash tender offer for its Series A Preferred Units (the “Preferred Tender Offer”), whereby it accepted 75,075 Series A Preferred Units for a purchase price of $333.00 per Series A Preferred Unit and an aggregate purchase price of $25.0 million. Upon closing the Preferred Tender Offer, it eliminated $82.7 million of the Series A Preferred Unit liquidation preference due as of the settlement date, inclusive of $7.6 million of accrued distributions.
•Double E Project. For the year ended December 2020, the Partnership’s proportionate share of capital calls due in 2020 totaled $99.9 million, which includes $2.7 million in capitalized interest, and was funded with $20.6 million of Partnership generated funds and the issuance of $85.3 million of Subsidiary Series A Preferred Units.
•2020 Restructuring Costs. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed an internal initiative to evaluate and transform our cost structure, enhance margins and improve our competitive position in response to COVID-19 and the related weakening of the economy. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred approximately $5.6 million in restructuring costs relating to this initiative (included in general and administrative expense).
Trends and Outlook
Our business has been, and we expect our future business to continue to be, affected by the following key trends:
•Ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and fluctuations in demand for oil and natural gas;
•Natural gas, NGL and crude oil supply and demand dynamics;
•Production from U.S. shale plays;
•Capital markets availability and cost of capital; and
•Inflation and shifts in operating costs.
Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about, or interpretations of, available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.
Ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and fluctuations in demand for oil and natural gas. We continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its variants, on all aspects of our business, including how it has impacted and will impact our customers, employees, supply chain and distribution network. We are unable to predict the ultimate impact that COVID-19, its variants and related factors may have on our business, future results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Given the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and related market conditions, we cannot reasonably estimate the period of time that these events will persist or the full extent of the impact they will have on our business. The extent to which our operations may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including changes in the severity of the pandemic, countermeasures taken by governments, businesses and individuals to slow the spread of the pandemic, and the development and availability of treatments and the extent to which these treatments and vaccines may remain effective as potential new strains of the coronavirus emerge. Furthermore, the impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to and volatility in the financial markets remain unknown.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have modified our business practices, including restricting employee travel, utilizing COVID-19 pandemic tax relief (as allowed by the ERC Tax Credit), modifying employee work locations, implementing social distancing and enhancing sanitary measures in our facilities. Many of our suppliers, vendors and service providers have made similar modifications. Our increased reliance on remote access to our information systems increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity breaches. We may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers.
In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced oil and natural gas price volatility during 2021, largely due to supply and demand imbalances resulting from lower development activity decisions by our customers, actions by members of OPEC and other foreign, oil-exporting countries. This disrupted the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry and other industries that serve exploration and production companies. These industry conditions, coupled with those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, could lead to significant global economic contraction generally and in our industry in particular.
We have collaborated extensively with our customer base regarding impacts to their drilling and completion activities in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on recently updated production forecasts and 2022 development plans from our customers, we currently expect that 2022 activity will be lower than historical periods prior to COVID-19.
Natural gas, NGL and crude oil supply and demand dynamics. Natural gas continues to be a critical component of energy supply and demand in the United States. The average spot price of natural gas increased by approximately 92% from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to natural gas demand exceeding supply. The average daily Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price was $3.89 per MMBtu during 2021, compared with $2.03 per MMBtu during 2020. Henry Hub closed at $3.82 per MMBtu on December 31, 2021. As of January 31, 2022, Henry Hub 12-month strip pricing closed at $4.81 per MMBtu. Natural gas prices continue to trade at higher-than-average historical prices due in part to strong power sector demand and relatively modest new production growth. In response to the increasing natural gas prices, the number of active natural gas drilling rigs in the continental United States increased from 83 in December 2020 to 106 in December 2021, but still remains well below the 2017 through 2019 average of 177, according to Baker Hughes. The average amount of working natural gas in underground storage in the continental U.S. was 2.7 Tcfe in 2021, which was 11% lower than in 2020. Over the long term, we believe that the prospects for continued natural gas demand are favorable and will be driven primarily by global population and economic growth, as well as the continued displacement of coal-fired electricity generation by natural gas-fired electricity generation and increase in U.S. LNG exports. Over the next several years, we expect natural gas prices will support continued upstream industry activity by producers focused on natural gas production.
In addition, certain of our gathering systems are directly affected by crude oil supply and demand dynamics. Crude oil prices increased in 2021, with the average daily Cushing, Oklahoma West Texas Intermediate crude oil spot price average of $39.16 per barrel during 2020 to an average of $68.14 per barrel during 2021, representing a 74% increase, reflecting broader market concerns for global oil supply and demand dynamics. In response to the increasing crude oil prices, the number of active crude oil drilling rigs in the continental United States increased from 267 in December 2020 to 480 in December 2021, but still remains well below the 2017 through 2019 average of 773, according to Baker Hughes. Over the next several years, we expect that crude oil prices will support continued drilling activity and increasing production in the Williston Basin, Permian Basin and, given the current regulatory environment in Colorado, in rural parts of the DJ Basin.
Despite improving fundamentals that should support additional development activities, we note that over the last several years there has been an increasing societal opposition to the production of hydrocarbons generally, which may be reflected in legislation, executive orders or regulations that may significantly restrict the domestic production of fossil fuels, including natural gas.
Growth in production from U.S. shale plays. Over the past several years, natural gas production from unconventional shale resources has increased significantly due to advances in technology that allow producers to extract significant volumes of natural gas from unconventional shale plays on favorable economic terms relative to most conventional plays. In recent years, a number of producers and their joint venture partners, including large international operators, industrial manufacturers and private equity sponsors, have committed significant capital to the development of these unconventional resources, including the Piceance, Barnett, Bakken, Marcellus, Utica and Permian Basin shale plays in which we operate. We believe that these long-term capital investments should support drilling activity in unconventional shale plays over the long term.
Rate of growth in production from U.S. shale plays. Some of our producer customers have adjusted their drilling and completion activities and schedules to manage drilling and completion costs at levels that are achievable using internally generated cash flow from their underlying operations. Historically, as part of a strategy to accelerate production growth, these producers would raise external capital to fund drilling and completion costs in excess of the cash flows generated from their underlying assets. Producers are experiencing increasing pressure from their investors to focus on returning capital and maximizing free cash flow versus re investing that cash flow into development. In general, we expect our producer customers to maintain moderate completion and production activities across many of our systems relative to our previous expectations as a result of the commodity price environment and a continuation of the general trend of producers constraining drilling and completion activity to levels that can be satisfied with internally generated cash flow.
Capital markets availability and cost of capital. Capital markets conditions, including but not limited to availability and higher borrowing costs, could affect our ability to access the debt and equity capital markets to the extent necessary, to fund our future growth. Furthermore, market demand for equity issued by master limited partnerships has been significantly lower in recent years than it has been historically, which may make it more challenging for us to finance our capital expenditures with the issuance of additional equity. We announced the elimination of our common unit distribution in May 2020 beginning with the distribution paid in respect of the first quarter of 2020, and this action may further reduce demand for our common units. In addition, interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly.
Inflation and operating costs. The annual rate of inflation in the United States hit 7.5% in January 2022, the highest in more than three decades, as measured by the Consumer Price Index. We expect that inflation in 2022 will increase our operating costs and the overall cost of capital projects we undertake. While some of our fee arrangements escalate based on changes in price indexes, these fee escalations may not be sufficient to offset an increase in our expenditures. Furthermore, inflation may impact producers economic decision making, which in turn could impact their willingness to develop acreage in areas that are more susceptible to inflationary pressures and labor force shortages.
How We Evaluate Our Operations
We conduct and report our operations in the midstream energy industry through five reportable segments: Northeast, Rockies, Permian, Piceance and Barnett. Each of our reportable segments provides midstream services in a specific geographic area and our reportable segments reflect the way in which we internally report the financial information used to make decisions and allocate resources in connection with our operations (see Note 18 - Segment Information to the consolidated financial statements). Our management uses a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze our consolidated and segment performance and we view these metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability. These metrics include (i) throughput volume, (ii) revenues, (iii) operation and maintenance expenses, (iv) capital expenditures and (v) segment adjusted EBITDA.
Throughput Volume
The volume of (i) natural gas that we gather, compress, treat and/or process and (ii) crude oil and produced water that we gather depends on the level of production from natural gas or crude oil wells connected to our gathering systems. Aggregate production volumes are impacted by the overall amount of drilling and completion activity. Furthermore, because the production rate of natural gas and crude oil wells decline over time, production can only be maintained or increased by new drilling or other activity.
As a result, we must continually obtain new supplies of production to maintain or increase the throughput volume on our systems. Our ability to maintain or increase throughput volumes from existing customers and obtain new supplies of throughput is impacted by:
•successful drilling activity within our AMIs;
•the level of work-overs and recompletions of wells on existing pad sites to which our gathering systems are connected;
•the number of new pad sites in our AMIs awaiting connections;
•our ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells in the areas in which we operate outside of our existing AMIs; and
•our ability to gather, treat and/or process production that has been released from commitments with our competitors.
We report volumes gathered for natural gas in cubic feet per day. We aggregate crude oil and produced water gathering and report volumes gathered in barrels per day.
Revenues
Our revenues are primarily attributable to the volumes that we gather, compress, treat and/or process and the rates we charge for those services. A majority of our gathering and processing agreements are fee-based, which limits our direct exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices; however, certain of our contracts have rates that are directly impacted by commodity prices. We also have percent-of-proceeds arrangements with certain customers under which the gathering and processing revenues that we earn correlate directly with the fluctuating price of natural gas, condensate and NGLs.
Certain of our gathering and processing agreements contain MVCs pursuant to which our customers agree to ship or process a minimum volume of production on our gathering systems, or, in some cases, to pay a minimum monetary amount, over certain periods during the term of the MVC. These MVCs help us generate stable revenues and serve to mitigate the financial impact associated with declining volumes.
Operation and Maintenance Expenses
We seek to maximize the profitability of our operations in part by minimizing, to the extent appropriate, expenses directly tied to operating our assets. Direct labor costs, compression costs, ad valorem taxes, repair and non-capitalized maintenance costs, integrity management costs, utilities and contract services comprise the most significant portion of our operation and maintenance expense. Other than utilities expense, these expenses are largely independent of volumes delivered through our gathering systems but may fluctuate depending on the activities performed during a specific period.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA
Segment adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental financial measure used by management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others.
Segment adjusted EBITDA is used to assess:
•the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to make cash distributions and support our indebtedness;
•the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis;
•our operating performance and return on capital as compared to other companies in the midstream energy sector, without regard to financing or capital structure;
•the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities; and
•the financial performance of our assets without regard to (i) income or loss from equity method investees, (ii) the impact of the timing of MVC shortfall payments under our gathering agreements or (iii) the timing of impairments or other noncash income or expense items.

For additional information on volumes, see the “Segment Overview for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020” section herein.
Revenues. Total revenues increased $17.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, comprised of a $33.4 million increase in natural gas, NGLs and condensate sales and a $4.8 million increase in Other revenues, offset by a $21.1 million decrease in gathering services and related fees.
Gathering services and related fees. Gathering services and related fees decreased $21.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily reflecting:
•a $11.4 million decrease in gathering services and related fees in the Piceance, primarily due to lower volume throughput due to a lack of drilling and completion activity and natural production declines; and
•an $8.3 million decrease in gathering services and related fees in the Rockies, primarily due to lower volume throughput as a result of limited drilling and completion activity that was insufficient to offset natural production declines.
Natural Gas, NGLs and Condensate Sales. Natural gas, NGLs and condensate sales revenue increased $33.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily reflecting:
•a $28.0 million increase in the Rockies reportable segment;
•a $9.9 million increase in the Permian reportable segment; and
•a $2.9 million increase in the Piceance reportable segment; partially offset by
•a $7.3 million decrease in the Barnett reportable segment.
Costs and expenses. Total costs and expenses increased $14.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily reflecting:
Cost of natural gas and NGLs. Cost of natural gas and NGLs increased $45.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by higher natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices.
Operation and maintenance. Operation and maintenance expense decreased $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020; primarily driven by reduced employee headcount as a result of restructuring activities implemented in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Partnership realized $10.2 million of benefits during the year ended December 31, 2021, that are not otherwise expected to occur in 2022 and future periods, as a result of commercial settlements and the ERC Tax Credit.
General and Administrative. General and administrative expense decreased $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a decrease in salaries and benefits associated with lower headcount from our workforce restructuring in late 2020 (the "2020 Restructuring Plan") and lower legal expenses. General and administrative expense includes a loss related to the 2015 Blacktail Release of $22.4 million and $17.0 million during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively (see Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies for additional information).
The Partnership realized $1.0 million of ERC Tax Credit benefits during the year ended December 31, 2021, that are not otherwise expected to occur in future periods.
Loss on ECP Warrants. On August 5, 2021, the ECP Entities cashlessly exercised all of its ECP Warrants for an aggregate of 414,447 SMLP common units, net of the exercise price. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Partnership recognized a $13.6 million non-cash loss related to the ECP Warrants.
Interest Expense. The decrease in interest expense in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily due to lower debt balances as a result of our liability management initiatives completed during 2020 which included (i) the Open Market Repurchases, (ii) the Debt Tender Offers, and (iii) the TL Restructuring. The decrease in interest expense was partially offset by borrowings on the Permian Transmission Credit Facility and higher interest costs resulting from the issuance of the 2026 Secured Notes.
Gain on early extinguishment of debt. The $203.1 million gain on the early extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily related to liability management initiatives undertaken during 2020 that resulted in a $86.4 million gain from the Open Market Repurchases, a $23.3 million gain from the Debt Tender Offers, and a $93.9 million gain from our TL Restructuring. Further details of our liability management results are summarized below.
Segment Overview for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Northeast.
Volume throughput for the Northeast reportable segment follows.
Volume throughput for the Northeast, excluding Ohio Gathering, increased 5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to 35 new well connections, partially offset by natural production declines from existing wells.
Volume throughput for the Ohio Gathering system decreased 8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of natural production declines on existing wells on the system, partially offset by 17 new well connections.
Financial data for our Northeast reportable segment follows.

General and administrative. General and administrative expense attributable to Corporate and Other decreased by $13.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of increased restructuring and deal costs in 2020, as well as a decrease in salaries and benefits associated with lower headcount from our 2020 Restructuring Plan and other cost-cutting initiatives. General and administrative expense includes a loss related to the 2015 Blacktail Release of $22.4 million and $17.0 million during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively (see Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies for additional information).
Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $12.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to lower debt balances as a result of our liability management initiatives completed during 2020 which included (i) the Open Market Repurchases, (ii) the Debt Tender Offers, and (iii) the TL Restructuring. The decrease in interest expense was partially offset by borrowings on the Permian Transmission Credit Facility and higher interest costs resulting from the issuance of the 2026 Secured Notes.
Gain on Early Extinguishment of Debt. The gain on the early extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily related to liability management initiatives undertaken during 2020 that resulted in a $86.4 million gain from the Open Market Repurchases, a $23.3 million gain from the Debt Tender Offers, and a $93.9 million gain from our TL Restructuring.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We rely primarily on internally generated cash flow as well as external financing sources, including our ABL Facility and the issuance of debt, equity and preferred equity securities, and proceeds from potential asset divestitures to fund our capital expenditures. We believe that our ABL Facility and Permian Transmission Credit Facility, together with internally generated cash flow and access to debt or equity capital markets, will be adequate to finance our operations for the next twelve months without adversely impacting our liquidity.
We may enter into off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance sheet obligations. As of December 31, 2021, our material off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions include (i) letters of credit outstanding against our ABL Facility aggregating to $23.9 million, and (ii) outstanding surety bonds aggregating to $2.0 million. There are no other transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of our capital resources.
ABL Facility. Summit Holdings has a $400.0 million revolving ABL Facility pursuant to that certain Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of November 2, 2021 (the “ABL Agreement”), with a maturity date of May 1, 2026. The maturity date of the ABL Facility will spring forward to December 13, 2024 if the outstanding amount of the 2025 Senior Notes on such date equals or exceeds $50.0 million or to January 14, 2025 if any amount of the 2025 Senior Notes is outstanding on such date and Liquidity (as defined in the ABL Agreement) is less than the sum of the outstanding principal amount of the 2025 Senior Notes and the Threshold Amount (as defined in the ABL Agreement). As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding balance of the ABL Facility was $267.0 million and the unused commitments were $109.1 million, after giving effect to the issuance thereunder of $23.9 million of outstanding but undrawn irrevocable standby letters of credit. The ABL Facility is secured by a first lien on all of our assets and borrowings are subject to a borrowing base comprised of a percentage of eligible accounts receivable of Summit Holdings and its subsidiaries that guarantee the ABL Facility (collectively, the “ABL Facility Guarantors”) and a percentage of eligible above-ground fixed assets including eligible compression units, processing plants, compression stations and related equipment of Summit Holdings and the ABL Facility Guarantors. As of the date of the most recent borrowing base determination, eligible assets totaled $691.2 million, an amount greater than the $400.0 million capacity of the ABL Facility.
There were no defaults or events of default under the ABL Facility during 2021, and as of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the financial covenants in the ABL Facility. The ABL Facility requires that Summit Holdings not permit (i) the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the ABL Agreement) as of the last day of any fiscal quarter to be greater than 2.50:1.00, or (ii) the Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the ABL Agreement) as of the last day of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.00:1.00.
The ABL Facility restricts, among other things, Summit Holdings’ and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ (as defined in the ABL Agreement) ability and the ability of certain of their subsidiaries to: (i) incur additional debt or issue preferred stock; (ii) make distributions or repurchase equity; (iii) make payments on or redeem junior lien, unsecured or subordinated indebtedness; (iv) create liens or other encumbrances; (v) make investments, loans or other guarantees; (vi) engage in transactions with affiliates; and (viii) make acquisitions or merge or consolidate with another entity. These covenants are subject both to a number of important exceptions and qualifications.
Permian Transmission Term Loan and Permian Transmission Credit Facility. We have $175.0 million of senior secured credit facilities, which includes a $160.0 million term loan (the “Permian Transmission Term Loan”) and a $15.0 million working capital facility (the “Permian Transmission Credit Facility”). As of December 31, 2021, the balance of the Permian Transmission Credit Facility was $160.0 million, and we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the $160.0 million Permian Transmission Credit Facility.
2025 Senior Notes. In February 2017, the Co-Issuers co-issued $500.0 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes maturing April 15, 2025 (the “2025 Senior Notes”). As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding balance of the 2025 Senior Notes was $259.5 million. The 2025 Senior Notes are senior, unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior obligations. The 2025 Senior Notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of our secured indebtedness, to the extent of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The Co-Issuers may redeem all or part of the 2025 Senior Notes at a redemption price of 102.875% (with the redemption price declining ratably each April 15 to 100.000% on April 15, 2023), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date.
2026 Secured Notes. In November 2021, we issued $700.0 million of the 2026 Secured Notes, at a price of 98.5% of face value. The Co-Issuers pay interest on the 2026 Secured Notes semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on April 15, 2022, and the 2026 Secured Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed, on a senior second-priority secured basis (subject to permitted liens), by us and each of our restricted subsidiaries that is an obligor under the ABL Facility, or under the 2025 Senior Notes on the issue date of the 2026 Secured Notes. As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding balance of the 2026 Secured Notes was $700.0 million.
Starting in the first quarter of 2023 with respect to the fiscal year ended 2022, and continuing annually through the fiscal year ended 2025, the Partnership is required under the terms of the 2026 Secured Notes Indenture to, if it has Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the 2026 Secured Notes Indenture), and subject to its ability to make such an offer under the ABL Credit Facility, offer to purchase an amount of the 2026 Secured Notes, at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, equal to 100% of the Excess Cash Flow generated in the prior year. Generally, if the Partnership does not offer to purchase designated annual amounts of its 2026 Secured Notes, or reduce its first lien capacity under the 2026 Secured Notes Indenture per annum from 2023 through 2025, the interest rate on the 2026 Secured Notes is subject to certain rate escalations. Per the terms of the 2026 Secured Notes Indenture, the designated amounts are $50.0 million in aggregate by April 1, 2023, otherwise the interest rate shall automatically increase by 50 basis points per annum; $100.0 million in aggregate by April 1, 2024, otherwise the interest rate shall automatically increase by 100 basis points per annum (minus any amount previously increased); and $200.0 million in aggregate by April 1, 2025, otherwise the interest rate shall automatically increase by 200 basis points per annum (minus any amount previously increased).
To the extent the Partnership makes an offer to purchase, and the offer is not fully accepted by the holders of the 2026 Secured Notes, the Partnership may use any remaining amount not accepted for any purpose not prohibited by the 2026 Secured Notes Indenture, or the ABL Facility.
Double E distribution waterfall. With the commencement of the first flow of gas on the Double E pipeline in November 2021, distributions from Double E will be made monthly starting in the first quarter of 2022. Distributions made to Summit Permian Transmission, LLC will be used to satisfy interest and principal payments required under the Permian Transmission Credit Facility. Any excess cash after these principal and interest payments will then be distributed to Summit Permian Transmission Holdco, LLC to pay the cash distribution due on the Subsidiary Series A Preferred Equity and to redeem portions of the Subsidiary Series A Preferred Units. Currently, we expect Summit Permian Transmission Holdco, LLC will use all of its expected cash receipts in 2022.
Preferred Exchange Offers. In April 2021, we completed the 2021 Preferred Exchange Offer, whereby we exchanged 18,662 Series A Preferred Units for 538,715 newly issued common units, which is net of units withheld for withholding taxes. In January 2022, we completed the 2022 Preferred Exchange Offer, whereby we exchanged 77,939 Series A Preferred Units for 2,853,875 newly issued common units, which is net of units withheld for withholding taxes.
We may in the future use a combination of cash, secured or unsecured borrowings and issuances of our common units or other securities and the proceeds from asset sales to retire or refinance our outstanding debt or Series A Preferred Units through privately negotiated transactions, open market repurchases, redemptions, exchange offers, tender offers or otherwise, but we are under no obligation to do so.

Contractual Obligations Update
The Partnership’s cash flows generated from operations are the primary source for funding various contractual obligations. The table below summarizes the Partnership’s major commitments as of December 31, 2021 through 2026 (in thousands):
(1)Amounts above exclude the impact of principal reductions resulting from offers to purchase the 2026 Secured Notes with excess cash flow tenders required in the 2026 Secured Notes indenture.
(2)Amounts include an estimate for interest cost based on either the stated interest rate for fixed rate indebtedness or the interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2021 for variable rate indebtedness.
(3)Amounts assumes the conversion of the Permian Transmission Credit Facility to a Term Loan as of December 31, 2021, with mandatory principal repayments of $4.6 million in 2022, $10.5 million in 2023, $15.5 million in 2024, $16.6 million in 2025 and $17.0 million in 2026.
(4)The Partnership issued a parental guaranty on behalf of its wholly owned subsidiary to fund the subsidiary’s pro rata share of required Double E construction project capital calls. As of December 31, 2021, this amount represents the Partnership's best estimate of its remaining obligation to fund Double E for the construction of the Double E Project.
(5)Amounts are Summit Midstream Marketing’s gross firm transportation commitments to its equity method investment in Double E, in which the Partnership has a 70% ownership interest. The amounts exclude benefits realized by the Partnership resulting from its proportionate share of net income generated by Double E.
Capital Requirements
Our business is capital intensive, requiring significant investment for the maintenance of existing gathering systems and the acquisition or construction and development of new gathering systems and other midstream assets and facilities. Our Partnership Agreement requires that we categorize our capital expenditures as either:
•maintenance capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures (including expenditures for the addition or improvement to, or the replacement of, our capital assets or for the acquisition of existing, or the construction or development of new, capital assets) made to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity; or
•expansion capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures incurred for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long term.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, cash paid for capital expenditures totaled $25.0 million which included $7.5 million of maintenance capital expenditures. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we contributed $148.7 million to Double E, which includes $3.0 million in capitalized interest.
We rely primarily on internally generated cash flow as well as external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt, equity and preferred equity securities, and proceeds from asset divestitures to fund our capital expenditures. We believe that our internally generated cash flow and access to debt or equity capital markets, will be adequate to finance our business for the next twelve months without adversely impacting our liquidity.
Considering the current commodity price backdrop and continued uncertainty regarding impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, we will remain disciplined with respect to future capital expenditures, which will be primarily concentrated on accretive bolt-on opportunities of our existing systems in the Northeast, Rockies and Permian.
We estimate that our 2022 capital program will range from $20.0 million to $35.0 million, including between $10.0 million and $15.0 million of maintenance capital expenditures.
There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our current expectations to change, including, but not limited to, (i) the ability to reach agreement with third parties; (ii) prevailing conditions and outlook in the natural gas, crude oil and NGL industries and markets and (iii) our ability to obtain financing from commercial banks, the capital markets, or other financing sources.
Credit and Counterparty Concentration Risks
We examine the creditworthiness of counterparties to whom we extend credit and manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approval, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions, we may request letters of credit, prepayments or guarantees.
Certain of our customers may be temporarily unable to meet their current obligations. While this may cause a disruption to cash flows, we believe that we are properly positioned to deal with the potential disruption because the vast majority of our gathering assets are strategically positioned at the beginning of the midstream value chain. The majority of our infrastructure is connected directly to our customers’ wellheads and pad sites, which means our gathering systems are typically the first third-party infrastructure through which our customers’ commodities flow and, in many cases, the only way for our customers to get their production to market.
We have exposure due to nonperformance under our MVC contracts whereby a customer, who does not meet its MVCs, does not have the wherewithal to make its MVC shortfall payments when they become due. We typically receive payment for all prior-year MVC shortfall billings in the quarter immediately following billing. Therefore, our exposure to risk of nonperformance is limited to and accumulates during the current year-to-date contracted measurement period.
Summarized Financial Information
The supplemental summarized financial information below reflects SMLP’s separate accounts, the combined accounts of the Co-Issuers and the Guarantor Subsidiaries (the Co-Issuers and, together with the Guarantor Subsidiaries, the “Obligor Group”) for the dates and periods indicated. The financial information of the Obligor Group is presented on a combined basis and intercompany balances and transactions between the Co-Issuers and Guarantor Subsidiaries have been eliminated. There were no reportable transactions between the Co-Issuers and Obligor Group and the subsidiaries that were not issuers or guarantors of the 2025 Senior Notes and the 2026 Senior Notes.
Payments to holders of the 2025 Senior Notes and the 2026 Secured Notes are affected by the composition of and relationships among the Co-Issuers, the Guarantor Subsidiaries and Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, who are unrestricted subsidiaries of SMLP and are not issuers or guarantors of the 2025 Senior Notes and the 2026 Secured Notes. The assets of our unrestricted subsidiaries are not available to satisfy the demands of the holders of the 2025 Senior Notes and the 2026 Secured Notes. In addition, our unrestricted subsidiaries are subject to certain contractual restrictions related to the payment of dividends, and other rights in favor of their non-affiliated stakeholders, that limit their ability to satisfy the demands of the holders of the 2025 Senior Notes and the 2026 Secured Notes.
A list of each of SMLP’s subsidiaries that is a guarantor, issuer or co-issuer of our registered securities subject to the reporting requirements in Release 33-10762 is filed as Exhibit 22.1 to this Annual Report.
Summarized Balance Sheet Information. Summarized balance sheet information as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 follow.
Summarized Statements of Operations Information. For the purposes of the following summarized statements of operations, we allocate a portion of general and administrative expenses recognized at the SMLP parent to the Obligor Group to reflect what those entities' results would have been had they operated on a stand-alone basis. Summarized statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 follow.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. As of December 31, 2021, we had net property, plant and equipment with a carrying value of approximately $1.7 billion and net amortizing intangible assets with a carrying value of approximately $172.9 million. When evidence exists that we will not be able to recover a long-lived asset's carrying value through future cash flows, we write down the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value. We test assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. With respect to property, plant and equipment and our amortizing intangible assets, the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if the carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset's use and eventual disposal. In this situation, we would recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the asset's fair value. We determine fair value using a combination of approaches, including a market-based approach and an income-based approach in which we discount the asset's expected future cash flows to reflect the risk associated with achieving the underlying cash flows. Any impairment determinations involve significant assumptions and judgments. Differing assumptions regarding any of these inputs could have a significant effect on the various valuations. As such, the fair value measurements utilized within these estimates are classified as non-recurring Level 3 measurements in the fair value hierarchy because they are not observable from objective sources. Due to the volatility of the inputs used, we cannot predict the likelihood of any future impairment.
We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when we believe the current fair value may be less than the carrying amount and record an impairment if we believe the decline in value is other than temporary.
Adjustments for MVC Shortfall Payments. For our calculation of segment adjusted EBITDA, we estimate the impact of expected MVC shortfall payments based on assumptions that include, but are not limited to, contract terms, historical volume throughput data, and expectations regarding future investment expenditures, customer drilling activities, and customer production volumes.
