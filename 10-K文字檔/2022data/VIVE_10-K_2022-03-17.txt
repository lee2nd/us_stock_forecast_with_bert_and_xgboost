Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Forward-Looking Statements
This report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology including, "could" "may", "will", "should", "expect", "plan", "anticipate", "believe", "estimate", "predict", "potential" and the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially.
While these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested in this Annual Report.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, risks described in the section entitled “Risk Factors”.
Overview of Our Business
In the discussion below, when we use the terms “we”, “us” and “our”, we are referring to Viveve Medical, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Viveve, Inc. and Viveve BV.
We design, develop, manufacture and market a platform medical technology, which we refer to as Cryogen-cooled Monopolar Radiofrequency (“CMRF”). Our proprietary CMRF technology is delivered through an RF generator, handpiece and treatment tip that, collectively, we refer to as the Viveve® System. The Viveve System is currently marketed and sold for a number of indications, depending on the relevant country-specific clearance or approval. Currently, the Viveve System is cleared for marketing in 50 countries throughout the world under the following indications for use:
Indication for Use:
No. of
Countries:
General surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis
(including the U.S.)
General surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis of vaginal tissue and the treatment of vaginal laxity
For treatment of vaginal laxity
For treatment of the vaginal introitus, after vaginal childbirth, to improve sexual function
General surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis as well as for the treatment of vaginal laxity
For vaginal rejuvenation
For treatment of vaginal laxity and to improve mild urinary incontinence and sexual function
In the U.S., the Viveve System is indicated for use in general surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis and we market and sell primarily through a direct sales force. Outside the U.S., we primarily market and sell through distribution partners. As of December 31, 2021, we have a global installed base of 884 Viveve Systems and we have sold approximately 61,000 single-use treatment tips worldwide.
Because the revenue we have earned to date have not been sufficient to support our operations, we have relied on sales of our securities, bank term loans and loans from related parties to fund our operations.
We are subject to risks, expenses and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in the medical device industry. These risks include, but are not limited to, intense competition, whether we can be successful in obtaining FDA and other governmental clearance or approval for the sale of our product for all desired indications and whether there will be a demand for the Viveve System, given that the cost of the procedure will likely not be reimbursed by the government or private health insurers. In addition, we will continue to require substantial funds to support our clinical trials and fund our efforts to expand regulatory clearance or approval for our products, including in the U.S. We cannot be certain that any additional required financing will be available when needed or on terms which are favorable to us. Our operations to date have been primarily funded through the sales of our securities, bank term loans and loans from related parties. Various factors, including our limited operating history with limited revenue to date and our limited ability to market and sell our products have resulted in limited working capital available to fund our operations. There are no assurances that we will be successful in securing additional financing in the future to fund our operations going forward. Failure to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, raise additional capital or reduce certain discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives.
On December 1, 2020, the Company effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of all outstanding common stock of the Company. All share numbers, exercise prices for options and warrants, conversion price of preferred stock and other capitalization information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is represented on a post-split basis, unless as otherwise indicated.
Recent Events
Effective Shelf Registration Statement
On July 2, 2021, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC on Form S-3 for the proposed offering from time to time of up to $75,000,000 of our securities, including common stock, preferred stock, and/or warrants. This registration statement currently has a capacity of $75,000,000. However, as a result of the limitations of General Instruction I.B.6. of Form S-3, or the so-called “baby shelf rules”, the amount of shares of our common stock available for sale under a registration statement on Form S-3 is limited to one-third of the aggregate market value of our common equity held by non-affiliates of the Company over any rolling 12-month period. As of December 31, 2021, we have not issued any shares or received any proceeds pursuant to the universal shelf registration statement.
Reduction of Common Warrant Exercise Price
On January 19, 2021, the Company closed a public offering at an effective price of $3.40 per share of its common stock. As a result, the per share exercise price of our previously issued Series B, A-2 and B-2 common stock warrants was automatically reduced pursuant to the terms of the warrants. The exercise price for Series B warrants was reduced from $6.10 per share to $3.40 per share. The exercise price for Series A-2 and B-2 warrants was reduced from $6.371 per share to $3.40 per share. There was no change to the quantity of warrant shares.
In February and March 2021, a total of 40,000 shares of common stock were issued in connection with the exercise of Series B warrants for gross proceeds of approximately $136,000 and a total of 12,760 shares of common stock were issued in connection with the exercise of January 2021 warrants for gross proceeds of approximately $43,000.
On May 4, 2021, pursuant to the provisions under the Purchase Agreement as amended, LPC (as defined below) purchased 250,000 shares at $2.817 per share of the Company’s common stock. As a result, the per share exercise price of our previously issued Series B, A-2 and B-2 common stock warrants was automatically reduced from $3.40 to $2.817 pursuant to the terms of the warrants. There was no change to the quantity of warrant shares.
As of December 31, 2021, there were Series B warrants to purchase a total of 285,632 shares of common stock, Series A-2 warrants to purchase a total of 392,830 shares of common stock, and Series B-2 warrants to purchase a total of 20,380 shares of common stock still remaining and outstanding.
2021 Public Offering
On January 19, 2021, the Company closed an upsized underwritten public offering of units (the “January 2021 Offering”) for gross proceeds of approximately $27,600,000, which included the exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option to purchase additional shares and warrants, prior to deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by Viveve.
The offering comprised of: (1) 4,607,940 Class A Units, priced at a public offering price of $3.40 per Class A Unit, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock, at an exercise price of $3.40 per share that expires on the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance; and (2) 2,450,880 Class B Units, priced at a public offering price of $3.40 per Class B Unit, with each unit consisting of one share of Series C convertible preferred stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock, at an exercise price of $3.40 per share that expires on the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance. The underwriter exercised an over-allotment option to purchase an additional 1,058,820 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 1,058,820 shares of common stock in the offering. The net proceeds to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately $25,122,000.
A total of 2,450,880 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock were issued in the January 2021 Offering. In January 2021, all Series C convertible preferred stock were converted into common stock and there are no remaining shares of Series C convertible preferred stock outstanding.
Warrants to purchase a total of 8,117,640 shares of common stock were issued in the January 2021 Offering. In February and March 2021, holders exercised January 2021 warrants to purchase 12,760 shares of common stock for aggregate exercise proceeds to the Company of approximately $43,000. As of December 31, 2021, there were January 2021 warrants to purchase a total of 8,104,880 shares of common stock still remaining and outstanding.
Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park Capital, LLC
The Company previously entered into a purchase agreement on June 8, 2020, as amended on March 31, 2021 (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (“LPC”), which provided that the Company had the right, in its sole discretion, to sell to LPC, and LPC has committed to purchase from us, up to $10,000,000 of our common stock, subject to certain limitations, from time to time over a 30-month period pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement.
On May 4, 2021, LPC purchased 250,000 shares of common stock at price per share of $2.817 under the Purchase Agreement for gross proceeds of approximately $704,000.
As of December 31, 2021, the equity facility with LPC has a remaining financing commitment of approximately $9,000,000.
Paycheck Protection Program Loan
The Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. On April 24, 2020, Viveve, Inc. (“Viveve”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a promissory note evidencing an unsecured loan in the aggregate amount of approximately $1,343,000 made to Viveve under the PPP (the “PPP Loan”). The PPP Loan to Viveve was made through Western Alliance Bank. The interest rate on the PPP Loan was 1.00% and the term was two years.
On May 25, 2021, the entire amount of the PPP Loan in the aggregate amount of $1,358,000, including the total principal amount and the accrued interest through the forgiveness payment date of May 21, 2021, was forgiven.
PURSUIT - U.S. Pivotal SUI Trial
The Company received FDA approval of its IDE application to conduct its U.S. pivotal, multicenter PURSUIT trial for improvement of SUI in women in July 2020, as well as FDA approval of requested amendments to the IDE protocol in December 2020. Initiation of the PURSUIT trial was announced by the Company on January 21, 2021 and completion of subject enrollment was reported on December 14, 2021. Topline results are anticipated at the end of 2022.
PURSUIT is a randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled trial with an intended enrollment of approximately 390 subjects with moderate SUI (≥ 10ml - 50ml urine leakage on the 1-hour Pad Weight Test) at up to 30 study sites in the U.S. Randomized in a 2:1 ratio for active and sham treatments, subjects in the active treatment arm (260 subjects) will receive CMRF treatment (90J/cm2 RF and cryogen-cooling), while subjects in the control arm (130 subjects) will receive an inert sham treatment.
The primary efficacy endpoint of the PURSUIT trial is a comparison of the proportion of patients who experience greater than 50% reduction in urine leakage compared to baseline on the standardized 1-hour Pad Weight Test at 12 months post-treatment versus the new sham procedure. The study also includes several secondary endpoints, including: proportion of patients who experience greater than 50% reduction in urine leakage on the standardized 1-hour Pad Weight Test at three and six months post-treatment, percentage change from baseline in the 1-hour Pad Weight Test at three, six and 12 months, percent of subjects with no incontinence episodes at three, six and 12 months post treatment as assessed with the three-day bladder voiding diary, and change from baseline in the MESA Questionnaire (Medical, Epidemiologic and Social Aspects of Aging), Incontinence Quality of Life (I-QOL), Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-1) Questionnaire, and International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI-SF) at three, six, and nine months post-treatment. Subject safety will be monitored throughout the study.
Three-Arm SUI Feasibility Study
In December 2019, the Company received approval of an ITA from the Canadian Ministry of Health and in January 2020 initiated a three-arm, three-month feasibility study to compare Viveve’s CMRF treatment and a cryogen-only sham to an inert sham treatment for the improvement of SUI in women. Completion of subject enrollment in the study was reported in March 2020. Study subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to the three arms and were assessed using the 1-hour Pad Weight Test, 3-day Voiding Diary, the 24-hour Pad Weight Test and I-QOL at five months post treatment. Due to patient, provider and medical facility health and safety concerns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the final subject follow-up visit was changed to five months versus three months.
Final results were reported in August 2020, indicating the primary efficacy endpoint (i.e., change from baseline in the standardized 1-hour Pad Weight Test at five months post treatment) was positively achieved. The median change from baseline in the active CMRF treatment group (N=13) and the cryogen-only sham treatment group (N=12) was -9.5 grams and -6.8 grams respectively, as compared to -4.4 grams in the inert sham treatment group (N=11). The study also assessed several secondary endpoints but showed no differentiation between groups. No device-related safety issues were reported. The meaningful separation demonstrated between the CMRF treatment arm and the inert sham arm in the feasibility study is believed to help provide confidence in the potential to achieve positive separation between the two treatment arms in the underway U.S. pivotal PURSUIT trial.
In-vivo Preclinical Study and Results for New Sham Treatment Tip
In response to the inconclusive results in which the treated arm showed no separation versus the sham control arm reported in July 2019 from the Company’s LIBERATE-International SUI trial conducted in Canada (aimed at supporting SUI indications in Canada, the European Union and several other international countries), Viveve conducted an in-vivo preclinical temperature and immunohistochemistry study to evaluate a new inert sham treatment tip. The Good Laboratory Practices study was initiated in June of this year following several months of engineering, validation, and development work. The study assessed both in-vivo tissue temperature changes during treatment, and histopathology at 30 days post-treatment compared to baseline, in three parous ewes using Viveve’s CMRF treatment tip (Active), cryogen-cooling only tip (“Old” sham treatment used in previous LIBERATE-International SUI study), and a new inert sham treatment tip. Histopathology of vaginal biopsies were performed and included use of α-SMA staining for fibroblast activation and formation. All tissue samples were evaluated by an independent and blinded pathologist.
The positive preclinical findings demonstrated, as reported in August 2020, that both temperature and immunohistochemistry results support the validity of the new inert sham tip to provide a true inert or placebo treatment. Only minor tissue temperature change (less than 2 degrees centigrade) was generated by the new inert sham tip and no fibroblast activation was shown through elevated a-SMA staining. In contrast, both the Active and cryogen-cooling sham tips demonstrated meaningful tissue temperature changes during treatment and increased fibroblast activation 30 days post-treatment. We believe that the positive in-vivo preclinical study validates our new inert sham tip for use in the U.S. pivotal PURSUIT trial that is currently underway.
New Category III CPT Code for SUI Procedure
In early July 2021, the Company announced that the American Medical Association (“AMA”) had issued a new Category III Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT”®) code for the Company’s dual-energy procedure effective January 1, 2022. The new code establishes a long-term pathway for potential reimbursement for Viveve’s noninvasive treatment under evaluation in the PURSUIT trial to improve SUI in women if approved by the FDA for this indication. The new Category III CPT code for Viveve’s SUI procedure is defined as: endovaginal cryogen-cooled, monopolar radiofrequency remodeling of the tissue surrounding the female bladder neck and proximal urethra for urinary incontinence.
U.S. Commercial Sales Transition to Recurring Revenue Rental Model
In June 2019, in addition to a capital sales model, we began a new recurring revenue rental model for the U.S. sales of the Viveve System. The new U.S. commercial sales model is intended to lower up-front costs for customers and thus lower hurdles to adoption, increase placement rates, and improve profitability by significantly reducing selling time per unit.
Under the recurring revenue rental model, customers may lease the Viveve System for a set initial term. After the initial term, the customer may purchase the Viveve System, continue to pay a monthly rental amount or terminate the contract.
The rental program is accounted for under the Financial Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) and meets the classification criteria for an operating lease. Revenue from the rental program is included in total revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, rental revenue recognized during the period was $1,214,000 and $1,337,000, respectively. The Viveve Systems that are being leased are included in property and equipment, net and depreciated over their expected useful lives of five years. When other products (“non-lease components”), such as single-use treatment tips or ancillary consumables, are included in the offering, the Company follows the relevant guidance in ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to determine how to allocate contractual consideration between the lease and non-lease components.
Impact of the Coronavirus
As of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the United States and many other countries continue to face outbreaks or resurgences of the highly transmissible pathogenic coronavirus and its variants, which has resulted in an increasingly widespread global health crisis, adversely affected general commercial activity and the economies and financial markets of many countries and is likely to continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts us will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others.
Plan of Operation
We intend to increase our sales both internationally and in the U.S. market by seeking additional regulatory clearances or approvals for the sale and distribution of our products, identifying and training qualified distributors and expanding the scope of physicians who offer the Viveve System.
In June 2019, in addition to a capital sales model, we began a new recurring revenue rental model for the U.S. sales of the Viveve System. Sale of Viveve products outside of the U.S. will continue to be supported by our international distributors.
In addition, we intend to use the strategic relationships that we have developed with outside contractors and medical experts to improve our products by focusing our research and development efforts on various areas including, but not limited to:
●
designing new treatment tips optimized for both ease-of-use and to reduce procedure times for patients and physicians; and
●
developing new RF consoles.
The net proceeds received from sales of our securities and the term loans have been used to support commercialization of our product in existing and new markets, for our research and development efforts and for protection of our intellectual property, as well as for working capital and other general corporate purposes. We expect that our cash will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least the next nine months through December 2022; however, we will continue to require funds to fully implement our plan of operation. Our operating costs include employee salaries and benefits, compensation paid to consultants, professional fees and expenses, costs associated with our clinical trials, capital costs for research and other equipment, costs associated with research and development activities including travel and administration, legal expenses, sales and marketing costs, general and administrative expenses, and other costs associated with an early stage public company subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). We also expect to incur expenses related to obtaining regulatory clearance and approvals in the U.S. and internationally as well as legal and related expenses to protect our intellectual property. We expect capital expenditures, for the foreseeable future, to be less than $1,000,000 annually.
We intend to continue to meet our operating cash flow requirements through the sales of our products and by raising additional capital from the sale of equity or debt securities. If we sell our equity securities, or securities convertible into equity, to raise capital, our current stockholders will likely be substantially diluted. We may also consider the sale of certain assets, or entering into a strategic transaction, such as a merger, with a business complimentary to ours, although we do not currently have plans for any such transaction. While we have been successful in raising capital to fund our operations since inception, other than as discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not have any committed sources of financing and there are no assurances that we will be able to secure additional funding, or if we do secure additional financing that it will be on terms that are favorable to us. If we cannot obtain financing, then we may be forced to curtail our operations or consider other strategic alternatives.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Revenue
We recorded revenue of $6,426,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to revenue of $5,479,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $947,000, or approximately 17%. The increase in revenue was primarily due to higher sales volume of Viveve Systems and treatment tips sold during the year. Revenue in 2021 included sales of 46 Viveve Systems and approximately 10,750 disposable treatment tips sold globally. Revenue in 2020 included sales of 31 Viveve Systems and approximately 8,900 disposable treatment tips sold globally.
Under the recurring revenue rental program, we placed 24 Viveve Systems in the U.S. market in 2021; however, these new placements were offset by the negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis on our sales activity in the year which resulted in the non-renewal of subscriptions for 36 Viveve Systems during the year. In 2020, we placed 29 Viveve Systems under the subscription offering program in the U.S. market, but these new placements were offset by the negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis on our sales activity in the year which resulted in the non-renewal of subscriptions for 42 Viveve Systems during the year. Rental revenue on these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, rental revenue recognized during the period was $1,214,000 and $1,337,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had deferred revenue in the amount of $452,000 and $345,000 related to its rental program.
Late in the first quarter of 2020 and through the end of the year 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic was in full effect adversely impacting commercial activity and the economies in the United States and most other countries and is likely to continue to adversely affect businesses and results of operations. Government and public health agencies issued directives halting performance of non-essential medical treatments and elective procedures in an effort to combat the spread of the coronavirus and protect public health and safety. As a result, Viveve’s customers either temporarily closed their medical practices or dramatically reduced services and staff. The consequence has been both a public health and economic crisis that continues for existing and prospective Viveve customers. In a supportive partnership response, in the second quarter of 2020 Viveve contacted all of its subscription customers and provided them with a three-month deferral of their rental payment. Although clinics in various regions continue to re-open and gradually increase their limited services, we anticipate that until the COVID-19 pandemic abates, more practices re-open and elective patient’s safety concerns are reduced that we will continue to experience reduced revenue from existing customers, as well as a greatly reduced number of new and prospective customers.
Gross Profit
Gross profit was $620,000 or 10% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to gross profit of $296,000, or 5% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $324,000, or approximately 109%. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the higher sales volume of Viveve Systems and treatment tips sold during the year. Additionally, fixed manufacturing costs in 2020 were spread over a lower sales volume thereby lowering gross margins for the year.
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses totaled $9,665,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to research and development expenses of $5,125,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $4,540,000, or approximately 89%.
Spending on research and development increased primarily due to higher clinical study costs related to the initiation of the pivotal U.S. PURSUIT clinical trial for the treatment of SUI in the first quarter of 2021 with subject enrollment advancing in the year. The subject enrollment in the trial was completed in December 2021. Furthermore, spending on research and development in 2021 also included increased engineering and development work related to our products.
Selling, general and administrative expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $12,508,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $13,666,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $1,158,000, or approximately 8%. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to reduced spending as a result of the Company’s organizational realignment to advance our SUI clinical development program and operational measures to lower costs and reduce cash burn in response to the continuing economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 crisis, partially offset by higher personnel costs for existing employees in 2021.
Gain on forgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program loan
In May 2021, the Company’s request for forgiveness of the PPP Loan was approved in full. The total principal amount and the accrued interest through the forgiveness payment date was forgiven. The Company recognized a gain on the extinguishment of debt in the amount of $1,358,000.
Modification of Series A and B Warrants
In January 2021, the Company reduced the exercise price of the outstanding Series B, A-2 and B-2 warrants pursuant to the terms of the warrants. The exercise price for Series B warrants was reduced from $6.10 per share to $3.40 per share. The exercise price for Series A-2 and B-2 warrants was reduced from $6.371 per share to $3.40 per share. The Series B, A-2 and B-2 warrant exercise price reduction resulted in the recognition of a modification expense of $287,000.
In May 2021, the Company reduced the exercise price of the outstanding Series B, A-2 and B-2 warrants from $3.40 per share to $2.817 per share pursuant to the terms of the warrants. The Series B, A-2 and B-2 warrant exercise price reduction resulted in the recognition of a modification expense of $86,000.
In April 2020, the Company reduced the exercise price of the outstanding Series A warrants and Series B warrants from $15.50 per share to $6.10 per share. The Series A and B warrant exercise price reduction resulted in the recognition of a modification expense of $1,838,000.
Interest expense
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we had interest expense, net, of $1,000,000 as compared to $910,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $90,000 or approximately 10%. The increase resulted primarily from a higher term loan balance in 2021 compared to 2020 due to the interest in-kind which was added to the total outstanding principal loan amount.
Other expense, net
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we had other expense, net, of $203,000 as compared to $289,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Loss from minority interest in limited liability company
The Company uses the equity method to account for its investment in InControl Medical, LLC (“ICM”). For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the allocated net loss from ICM’s operations was $256,000 and $383,000, respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Since inception, the Company has sustained significant operating losses and such losses are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. At December 31, 2021, we had accumulated deficit of $241,853,000, cash and cash equivalents of $19,162,000 and working capital of $17,705,000. The Company's financing activities provided cash of $25,973,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021, which was primarily due to the net proceeds from the January 2021 Offering. However, we used $12,878,000 in cash for operations during the year ended December 31, 2021. As of the date our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 are issued, we did not have sufficient cash to fund our operations through March 31, 2023, without additional financing and, therefore, we concluded there was substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued.
Management currently believes that it will be necessary for us to raise additional funding. We may obtain additional funding in the future through the issuance of our common stock, or through other equity or debt financing. The failure to raise additional funding when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We may not be able to obtain additional financing as needed on acceptable terms, or at all, which may require us to reduce our operating costs and other expenditures, including reductions of personnel, salaries and capital expenditures. Alternatively, or in addition to such potential measures, we may elect to implement additional cost reduction actions as we may determine are necessary and in our best interests. Any such actions undertaken might limit the Company’s ability to achieve its strategic objectives.
The following table summarizes the primary sources and uses of cash for the periods presented below (in thousands):
Operating Activities
We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant expenses in the areas of research and development, regulatory and clinical study costs associated with the Viveve System.
Operating activities used $12,878,000 of cash for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $15,234,000 used for the year ended December 31, 2020. The primary use of our cash was to fund selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses associated with the Viveve System. Net cash used during the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted of a net loss of $22,027,000 adjusted for noncash expenses including provision for doubtful accounts of $125,000, depreciation and amortization of $1,123,000, stock-based compensation of $3,779,000, non-cash interest expense of $606,000, amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets and accretion of operating lease liabilities of $16,000, a loss from minority interest in limited liability company of $256,000, a loss on disposal of property and equipment of $113,000, a noncash charge for the modification of Series B, A-2 and B-2 warrants of $373,000, a gain on the extinguishment of debt of $1,358,000 related to forgiveness of the PPP Loan and cash inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $4,116,000.

Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $456,000 and $781,000, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities during 2021 and 2020 was used for the purchase of property and equipment. The purchase of property and equipment primarily consisted of rental equipment in connection with our recurring revenue rental program, which was launched in June 2019. We expect to continue to purchase property and equipment in the normal course of our business. The amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods is difficult to predict and is dependent on a number of factors including, but not limited to, any increase in the number of our employees and any changes to the capital equipment requirements related to our development programs and clinical trials.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities during year ended December 31, 2021 was $25,973,000, which was the result of proceeds of $25,122,000 from the January 2021 Offering net of issuance costs, proceeds of $704,000 from purchase of common shares in connection with the Purchase Agreement with LPC, proceeds of $179,000 from exercises of common warrants and $38,000 of proceeds from issuance of common shares from employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by transaction costs of $70,000 in connection with the Purchase Agreement with LPC. As of December 31, 2021, the equity facility with LPC has a remaining financing commitment of approximately $9,000,000.
Net cash provided by financing activities during year ended December 31, 2020 was $9,230,000, which was the result of net proceeds of $8,407,000 from exercises of common warrants, proceeds of $1,343,000 from the PPP Loan and proceeds of $341,000 from the initial purchase of common shares under the Purchase agreement from LPC, partially offset by transaction costs of $334,000 in connection with the 2020 Warrant Offering, transaction costs of $494,000 in connection with the Purchase Agreement with LPC, and additional transaction costs of $33,000 in connection with our November 2019 Offering.
On July 2, 2021, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC on Form S-3 for the proposed offering from time to time of up to $75,000,000 of our securities, including common stock, preferred stock, and/or warrants. This registration statement currently has a capacity of $75,000,000. However, as a result of the limitations of General Instruction I.B.6. of Form S-3, or the so-called “baby shelf rules”, the amount of shares of our common stock available for sale under a registration statement on Form S-3 is limited to one-third of the aggregate market value of our common equity held by non-affiliates of the Company over any rolling 12-month period. As of December 31, 2021, we have not issued any shares or received any proceeds pursuant to the universal shelf registration statement.
Contractual Payment Obligations
In February 2017, we entered into a sublease for approximately 12,400 square feet of building space for the relocation of the Company’s corporate headquarters to Englewood, Colorado. The lease term was 36 months and the monthly base rent for the first, second and third years was $20.50, $21.12 and $21.75 per rentable square foot, respectively. In connection with the execution of the sublease, the Company paid a security deposit of approximately $22,000. The Company was also entitled to an allowance of approximately $88,000 for certain tenant improvements relating to the engineering, design and construction of the sublease premises. The lease term commenced in June 2017 and was to terminate in May 2021. In March 2021, the Company amended the sublease for its office building space. The lease term was extended for a period of 34 months and will terminate on March 31, 2024. The monthly gross rent for the first, second and third years of the lease extension is $21,028, $21,643 and $22,258 per month, respectively. The Company was also provided a rent abatement for the month of June 2021. Additionally, the sublandlord agreed to perform certain construction, repair, maintenance or other tenant improvements to the subleased premises with estimated costs of approximately $19,000.
In May 2017, the Company entered into the 2017 Loan Agreement with affiliates of CRG LP (“CRG”). The credit facility consists of $20,000,000 that was drawn at closing and the ability to access additional funding of up to an aggregate of $10,000,000 for a total of $30,000,000 under the credit facility. In December 2017, the Company accessed the remaining $10,000,000 available under the CRG credit facility. The term of the loan is six years with the first four years being interest only. In November 2019, the Company and CRG amended the 2017 Loan Agreement concurrent with the conversion of approximately $29,000,000 of the principal amount under the term loan with CRG (plus accrued interest, the prepayment premium and the back-end fee applicable thereto), for an aggregate amount of converted debt obligations of approximately $31,300,000. The amounts converted into 31,300 shares of the newly authorized Series B convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase up to 989,379 shares of common stock were also issued. The outstanding principal balance under the 2017 Loan Agreement was $5,124,000 as of December 31, 2021.
In October 2020, the Company entered into a 36-month noncancelable operating lease agreement for office equipment. The lease commenced in December 2020 and will terminate in December 2023. The monthly payment is approximately $2,000.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain accounting policies and estimates are particularly important to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management or can be materially affected by changes from period to period in economic factors or conditions that are outside of our control. As a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying these policies, management uses their judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. Those estimates are based on our historical operations, our future business plans and projected financial results, the terms of existing contracts, observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Please see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of our significant accounting policies.
Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on an actual cost basis on a first-in, first-out method. Inventory as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 is mainly finished goods but also includes a small quantity of raw materials. Lower of cost or net realizable value is evaluated by considering obsolescence, excessive levels of inventory, deterioration and other factors. Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value, if required, are made for estimated excess, obsolescence or impaired inventory. Excess and obsolete inventory is charged to cost of revenue and a new lower-cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.
As part of the Company’s recurring revenue rental model, the Company utilizes Viveve Systems transferred from finished goods inventory. The Company is amortizing these units over an estimated useful life of five years. The amortization of these Viveve Systems is charged to cost of sales and these units are included in the property and equipment, net balance on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable. When such an event occurs, management determines whether there has been an impairment by comparing the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows to the related asset’s carrying value. If an asset is considered impaired, the asset is written down to fair value, which is determined based either on discounted cash flows or appraised value, depending on the nature of the asset. The Company has not identified any such impairment losses to date.
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Revenue consists primarily of the sale of the Viveve System, single-use treatment tips and ancillary consumables. The Company applies the following five steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied. The Company considers customer purchase orders to be the contracts with a customer. Revenue, net of expected discounts, is recognized when the performance obligations of the contract with the customer are satisfied and when control of the promised goods are transferred to the customer, typically when products, which have been determined to be the only distinct performance obligations, are shipped to the customer. Expected costs of assurance warranties and claims are recognized as expense. Revenue is recognized net of any sales taxes from the sale of the products.
Rental revenue is generated through the lease of the Viveve System. The Company’s operating leases for the Viveve System have a rental period of 6s to 12 months and can be extended or terminated by the customer after that time or the Viveve System can be purchased by the customer. Rental revenue on those operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the underlying leases. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, rental revenue recognized was $1,214,000 and $1,337,000. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had deferred revenue in the amount of $452,000 and $345,000 related to its rental program.
In connection with the lease of the Viveve System, the Company offers single-use treatment tips and ancillary consumables that are considered non-lease components. In the contracts with lease and non-lease components, the Company follows the relevant guidance in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to determine how to allocate contractual consideration between the lease and non-lease components.
Sales of our products are subject to regulatory requirements that vary from country to country. The Company has regulatory clearance for differing indications, or can sell its products without a clearance, in many countries throughout the world, including countries within the following regions: North America, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific. In the United States, we market and sell primarily through a direct sales force. Outside of the United States, we market and sell primarily through distribution partners.
The Company does not provide its customers with a right of return.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectability of our accounts receivable in our calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In determining the amount of the allowance, we make judgements about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and assess current economic trends affecting our customers that might impact the level of credit losses in the future and result in different rates of bad debts than previously seen. We also consider our historical level of credit losses. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $66,000 and $124,000, respectively.
Product Warranty
The Company’s products are generally subject to a one-year warranty, which provides for the repair, rework or replacement of products (at the Company’s option) that fail to perform within stated specification. The Company has assessed the historical claims and, to date, product warranty claims have not been significant.
Research and Development
Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred. Research and development costs include, but are not limited to, payroll and personnel expenses, prototype materials, laboratory supplies, consulting costs, and allocated overhead, including rent, equipment depreciation, and utilities.
Income Taxes
Accounting for income taxes requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The liability method is used in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We evaluate annually the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets based on our historical losses and the uncertainty regarding our ability to project future taxable income. In future periods if we are able to generate income, we may reduce or eliminate the valuation allowance.
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments, and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Whether the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a tax position is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee’s service period. The Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award.
We determined that the Black-Scholes option pricing model is the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value for stock options and purchase rights under the Company’s employee stock purchase plan. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions which determine the fair value of share-based awards, including the option’s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock.
Equity instruments issued to nonemployees are recorded in the same manner as similar instruments issued to employees.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, as amended, which revises the measurement of credit losses for most financial instruments measured at amortized cost, including trade receivables, from an incurred loss methodology to an expected loss methodology which results in earlier recognition of credit losses. Under the incurred loss model, a loss is not recognized until it is probable that the loss-causing event has already occurred. The new standard introduces a forward-looking expected credit loss model that requires an estimate of the expected credit losses over the life of the instrument by considering all relevant information including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectability. The guidance in ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is still evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740). The amendments in this Update provide further simplification of accounting standards for the accounting for income taxes. Certain exceptions for are removed and requirements regarding the accounting for franchise taxes, tax basis of goodwill, and tax law rate changes are made. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2021 and the adoption of the guidance did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
We have reviewed other recent accounting pronouncements and concluded they are either not applicable to the business, or no material effect is expected on the consolidated financial statements as a result of future adoption.
Trends, Events and Uncertainties
Research, development and commercialization of new technologies and products is, by its nature, unpredictable. Although we will undertake development efforts, including efforts, with commercially reasonable diligence, there can be no assurance that we will have adequate capital to develop or commercialize our technology to the extent needed to create future sales to sustain our operations.
We cannot assure you that our technology will be adopted, that we will ever earn revenue sufficient to support our operations, or that we will ever be profitable. Furthermore, since we have no committed source of financing, we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise money as and when we need it to continue our operations. If we cannot raise funds as and when we need them, we may be required to severely curtail, or even to cease, our operations.
Other than as discussed above and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not aware of any trends, events or uncertainties that are likely to have a material effect on our financial condition.
