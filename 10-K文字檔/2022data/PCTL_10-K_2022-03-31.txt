ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Executive Overview
On August 31, 2016, PCT LTD entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") with Paradigm Convergence Technologies Corporation, a Nevada corporation ("Paradigm"). Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, Paradigm became the wholly-owned subsidiary of PCT LTD after the exchange transaction. PCT LTD is a holding company, which through Paradigm is engaged in the business of marketing new products and technologies through licensing and joint ventures.
PCT LTD had not recorded revenues for the two fiscal years prior to its acquisition of Paradigm and was dependent upon financing to continue basic operations. Paradigm has recorded revenue since it initiated operations in 2012; however, those revenues have not been sufficient to finance operations. The Company recorded a net income of $988,619 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and accumulated losses of $29,598,993 from inception through December 31, 2021.
PCT LTD remains dependent upon additional financing to continue operations. The Company intends to raise additional financing through private placements of its common stock and note payable issuances. We expect that we would issue such stock pursuant to exemptions to the registration requirements provided by federal and state securities laws. The purchasers and manner of issuance will be determined according to our financial needs, as discussed below, and the available exemptions to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. We also note that if we issue more shares of our common stock, then our stockholders may experience dilution in the value per share of their common stock.
The expected costs for the next twelve months include:
• continuation of commercial launch of non-toxic sanitizing, disinfecting and sterilizing products and technologies with a strong emphasis on health care facilities, including hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, clinics and medical, dental and veterinarian offices;
• continued research and development on product generation units including those designed for on-site deployment at customers' facilities;
• accelerated research and development and initial commercialization on applications of the products in the agricultural sector, most specifically with respect to abatement of a specific crop disease crisis caused by a bacterium in the U.S. and elsewhere;
• acquiring available complementary technology rights;
• payment of short-term debt;
• hiring of additional personnel in 2022; and
• general and administrative operating costs.
Management projects these costs to total approximately $2,580,000. To minimize these costs, the Company intends to maintain its practice of controlling operating overheads with efficient facilities commitments, generally below market salaries and consulting fees, and rigorous prioritization of expenditure requirements. Based on its understanding of the commercial readiness of its products and technologies, the capabilities of its personnel (current and being hired), established business relationships and the general market conditions, management believes that the Company expects to be covering its fixed operating expenses ("burn rate") by the end of the third quarter of 2022.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
A critical component of our operating plan impacting our continued existence is the ability to obtain additional capital through additional equity and/or debt financing. We do not anticipate generating sufficient positive internal operating cash flow until such time as we can deliver our products to market and generate substantial revenues, which may take the next full year to fully realize, if ever. In the event we cannot obtain the necessary capital to pursue our strategic plan, we may have to significantly curtail our operations. This would materially impact our ability to continue operations.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded net income of $988,619 and at December 31, 2021 had a working capital deficit of $4,466,106. Since inception we had not established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover our operating costs. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 we primarily relied upon equity issuances and advances and loans from stockholders and third parties to fund our operations. The Company has relied on raising debt and equity capital in order to fund its ongoing day-to-day operations and its corporate overhead. We had $116,497 in cash at December 31, 2021, compared to $115,196 in cash at December 31, 2020. We had total liabilities of $6,283,637 at December 31, 2021 compared to $11,038,156 at December 31, 2020.
Total assets decreased by $380,352 to $4,254,258 at December 31, 2021 compared to $4,634,610 at December 31, 2020. This decrease is primarily from a decrease in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and from depreciation and amortization recorded on intangible assets and right-of-use assets during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Total liabilities decreased by $4,754,519 to $6,283,637 at December 31, 2021 compared to $11,038,156 at December 31, 2020. This decrease is primarily from a decrease in derivative liabilities of $4,058,767 and a decrease in notes payable, notes payable - related party, and convertible notes payable of $616,995.
Our current cash flow is not sufficient to meet our monthly expenses of approximately $215,000 and to fund future research and development adequately. We intend to rely on additional debt financing, loans from existing stockholders and private placements of common stock for additional funding in addition to the increasing our recognized revenue from the leasing and/or sale of products; however, there is no assurance that additional funding will be available. We do not have material commitments for future capital expenditures. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain short-term financing, or that sources of such financing, if any, will continue to be available, and if available, that they will be on favorable terms.
During the next 12 months we anticipate incurring additional costs related to the filing of Exchange Act reports. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through funds provided by management, significant stockholders and/or third parties. We may also rely on the issuance of our common stock in lieu of cash to convert debt or pay for expenses.
The table below presents information regarding cash flows:
Commitments and Obligations
At December 31, 2021 the Company recorded notes payable totaling approximately $2,165,102 (related, non-related and convertible, net of debt discount) compared to notes payable totaling $2,781,597 (related, non-related and convertible, net of debt discount) at December 31, 2020. These notes payable represent cash advances received and expenses paid from third parties and related parties. At December 31, 2021, all of the notes payable carry effective interest from 0% to 12% and are due ranging from on demand to November 30, 2023.
The Company headquarters and operations are located in Little River, South Carolina. The Company re-negotiated an annual lease on the Little River, SC facility for $7,500 per month, retroactive to July 1, 2020, which is renewable for an additional four years (with a 2% increase annually). Effective July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022, the monthly lease payment is $7,650. The Company added a three-year lease for 9,600 sf. of warehouse space in Fort Wayne, Indiana, effective November 1, 2020, for $4,500/month. Effective April 1, 2021, the Company entered into a 2-year lease for additional office space in Little River, SC, for $2,750 per month, which was terminated effective October 14, 2021.
Results of Operations
Revenues decreased to $1,281,177 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $2,519,914 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The revenue decrease for the period was primarily due to the decreased volume of fluids sold as a result of the decreased need for an effective US EPA-registered disinfectant as the country came out of the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, product sales decreased to $233,147 during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $1,527,465 during the year ended December 31, 2020. However, revenue for equipment leases increased to $894,786 during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $750,496 during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Total operating expenses decreased to $3,773,257 during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $3,921,143 during the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease during the period was primarily due to a decrease in cost of product, licensing, and equipment leases of $884,456 partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses of $719,543.
General and administrative expenses increased to $3,204,922 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $2,485,379 during the year ended December 31, 2020. General and administrative increased due to stock-based compensation for consulting services, salaries and wages, and professional and accounting fees.
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $367,534 during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $348,708 during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Total other income was $3,480,699 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to other expense of $2,410,816 during the year ended December 31, 2020. The overall change was a primarily due to a gain on change in fair value of derivative liability of $22,861 and a gain on settlement of debt of $3,930,402 during the year ended December 31, 2021 versus a loss on change in fair value of derivative liability of $13,046,832 and a gain settlement of debt of $12,020,966 during the year ended December 31, 2020.
As a result of the changes described above, net income was $988,619 during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a net loss of $3,812,045 during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management’s estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.
