Ladder Capital is an internally-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that is a leader in commercial real estate finance. We originate and invest in a diverse portfolio of commercial real estate and real estate-related assets, focusing on senior secured assets. Our investment activities include: (i) our primary business of originating senior first mortgage fixed and floating rate loans collateralized by commercial real estate with flexible loan structures; (ii) owning and operating commercial real estate, including net leased commercial properties; and (iii) investing in investment grade securities secured by first mortgage loans on commercial real estate.

COVID-19 Impact on the Organization
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. We continue to actively manage the liquidity and operations of the Company in light of the market disruption and overall financial impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic across most industries in the United States. In view of the ongoing uncertainty related to the duration of the pandemic, its ultimate impact on our revenues, profitability and financial position is difficult to assess at this time. The Company has disclosed the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on our business throughout this Annual Report.

A discussion regarding our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 can be found in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020
The following table sets forth information regarding our consolidated results of operations ($ in thousands):
Investment Overview
Activity for the year ended December 31, 2021 included originating and funding $2.5 billion in principal value of commercial mortgage loans and $63.6 million of purchases of mortgage loans, which was offset by $305.6 million of sales and $1.1 billion of principal repayments. We acquired $247.0 million of new securities, which was offset by $438.6 million of sales and $164.5 million of amortization in the portfolio, which partially contributed to a net decrease in our securities portfolio of $355.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. We also invested $102.2 million in real estate, which included $81.8 million of real estate acquired via foreclosure, and received proceeds from the sale of real estate of $219.2 million.
Activity for the year ended December 31, 2020 included originating and funding $566.5 million in principal value of commercial mortgage loans, which was offset by $582.8 million of sales and $961.2 million of principal repayments. We acquired $440.4 million of new securities, which was partially offset by $931.9 million of sales and $135.9 million of amortization in the portfolio, which partially contributed to a net decrease in our securities portfolio of $663.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. We also invested $36.7 million in real estate, which included $29.3 million of real estate acquired via foreclosure, and received proceeds from the sale of real estate of $98.7 million.
Operating Overview
Net income (loss) totaled $56.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $(9.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The most significant drivers of the $66.4 million increase are as follows:
•an increase in total other income (loss) of $41.8 million, primarily as a result of a $23.7 million increase in realized gain on sale of real estate, net, a $17.0 million increase in net results from derivative transactions, a $14.0 million increase as a result of realized gain on securities, and an increase of $10.0 million in sales of loans, partially offset by a decrease of $22.3 million of gain on extinguishment of debt;
•an increase in net interest income after provision for loan losses of $7.8 million, as a result of a $27.0 million release of provision partially offset by a $19.2 million net decline of net interest income comprised of a $63.8 million decrease in interest income and a $44.5 million decrease in interest expense;
•a decrease in total costs and expenses of $27.5 million compared to the prior year, primarily attributable to a $19.8 million decrease in compensation and employee benefits, a $2.6 million decrease in operating expenses and a $2.4 million decrease in real estate operating expenses; and
•a decrease of $10.7 million in income tax expense (benefit) compared to the prior year is primarily as a result of taxable gain primarily as a result of loan sales in 2021 and net operating losses generating tax benefits in 2020.
Income (Loss) Before Taxes
Income (loss) before taxes totaled $57.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $(19.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The significant components of the $77.1 million increase in income before taxes are described in the first four bullet points under operating overview above.
Distributable Earnings
Distributable earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, totaled $61.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $51.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The significant components of the $10.0 million increase in distributable earnings are primarily as a result of an increase of $14.0 million of realized gain (loss) on securities, an increase of $12.1 million in sale of loans, net, an increase of $6.7 million in net results from derivative transactions, an increase of $6.7 million in compensation and employee benefits and an increase in realized gain on sale of $2.8 million real estate, net. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $22.3 million in gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt and a decrease of $10.1 million in net interest income after provision for loan losses comprised of a $63.8 million decrease in interest income, a $44.5 million decrease in interest expense, a decrease of $9.2 million in specific provision for loan losses and a decrease of $3.3 million in operating expenses.
Our results of operations in the second quarter of 2020 were significantly impacted by the actions we took to generate liquidity and pay down mark-to-market debt in direct response to the highly volatile market conditions that occurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The actions taken by management had multiple impacts on distributable earnings for the three months ended June 30, 2020. In late March of 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis continued to unfold, the ability of repurchase financing counterparties to determine the value of collateral in the form of CMBS was impaired as trading volumes in the commercial real estate securities market were at depressed levels characterized by very few buyers and very few, typically distressed, sellers. As a result, the Company received margin calls on its securities repurchase financing, all of which were successfully satisfied by the Company in cash in a timely manner. Management and the board of directors, as stockholders owning over 10% of the Company and as accountable stewards of all stockholders’ capital, elected to strategically position the Company for potential long-term volatility due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company therefore took decisive defensive actions, including halting new investment activity, selling performing loans and highly rated securities, paying down debt, including mark-to-market debt that was otherwise not due, as well as hiring professional service firms. These actions were significant strategic shifts to position the Company defensively against highly volatile market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The financial impact of such actions aggregated to a $16.9 million net reduction to distributable earnings for the three months ended June 30, 2020. The reduction included $34.5 million of losses comprised of (i) $6.7 million of losses from sales of performing first mortgage loans included in sale of loans, net; (ii) $15.4 million of losses from sales of CMBS; (iii) $3.7 million of losses from conduit loan sales; (iv) $6.5 million of prepayment penalties related to pay downs of mark-to-market debt included in interest expense; (v) $2.1 million of professional fee expenses included in operating expenses primarily for advisory fees related to increasing liquidity and paying down debt with $20 thousand in fees related to employee health and safety, compliance with local, state and national guidelines, and head count reduction; and (vi) $0.2 million of severance costs included in compensation and employee benefits. The losses were partially offset by (vii) $19.0 million of gains from the repurchase of, and extinguishment of, unsecured corporate bond debt at a discount from par, net of (viii) $1.5 million of accelerated premium amortization included in interest expense.
Refer to “-Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for our definition of distributable earnings and a reconciliation to income (loss) before taxes.
Net Interest Income
The $63.8 million decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to a decrease in our loan and securities portfolios due to paydowns and sales and timing of loan originations. The decline was also a result of the timing of our capital deployment primarily in the last nine months of 2021 which was at lower prevailing LIBOR rates. For the year ended December 31, 2021, securities investments averaged $0.8 billion and loan investments averaged $2.5 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2020, securities investments averaged $1.6 billion and loan investments averaged $3.0 billion. There was a $0.8 billion decrease in average securities, and a $0.5 billion decrease in average loan investments.
The $44.5 million decrease in interest expense is primarily due to repayments made on our facilities including our secured financing facility, loan repurchase facilities, the FHLB, and our revolving credit facility and amortization of a CLO which reduced interest expense. There was also a net decline in our interest expense related to our Notes as we redeemed the 2021 and 2022 Notes during the year, replacing them with newly issued, lower cost, 2029 Notes in June 2021.
The increase in net interest income before provision for loan losses of $19.2 million is explained in the paragraphs above.
As of December 31, 2021, the weighted average yield on our mortgage loan receivables was 5.7%, compared to 6.6% as of December 31, 2020 as the weighted average yield on new loans originated was lower than the weighted average yield on loans that were securitized or paid off. As of December 31, 2021, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings against our mortgage loan receivables was 2.6%, compared to 5.4% as of December 31, 2020. The decrease in the rate on borrowings against our mortgage loan receivables from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 was primarily due to the utilization of new sources of financing at lower borrowing rates obtained and held during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding borrowings secured by our mortgage loan receivables equal to 39.0% of the carrying value of our mortgage loan receivables, compared to 33.4% as of December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2021, the weighted average yield on our real estate securities was 1.7%, compared to 1.7% as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings against our real estate securities was 0.9%, compared to 1.1% as of December 31, 2020. The decrease in the rate on borrowings against our real estate securities from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 was primarily due to lower prevailing market borrowing rates as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding borrowings secured by our real estate securities equal to 74.4% of the carrying value of our real estate securities, compared to 75.1% as of December 31, 2020.
Our real estate is comprised of non-interest bearing assets; however, interest incurred on mortgage financing collateralized by such real estate is included in interest expense. As of December 31, 2021, the weighted average interest rate on mortgage borrowings against our real estate was 4.9%, compared to 5.0% as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding borrowings secured by our real estate equal to 77.9% of the carrying value of our real estate, compared to 77.8% as of December 31, 2020.
Provision for (release of) Loan Loss Reserves
On January 1, 2020, the Company recorded a CECL reserve of $11.6 million, which equated to 0.36% of $3.2 billion carrying value of its held for investment loan portfolio. This reserve excluded three loans that previously had an aggregate of $14.7 million of asset-specific reserves and a carrying value of $39.8 million as of January 1, 2020. Upon adoption, the aggregated CECL reserve reduced total shareholder’s equity by $5.8 million.
The total change in reserve for provision for the year ended December 31, 2021 was a release of $8.7 million. The release represents a decline in the general reserve of loans held for investment of $8.6 million and the release on unfunded loan commitments of $0.1 million. The release during the year is primarily due to an improvement in macroeconomic assumptions along with newly issued loans with lower expected loss. For additional information, refer to “Allowance for Credit Losses and Non-Accrual Status” in Note 3, Mortgage Loan Receivables, to the consolidated financial statements. The total change in reserve for provision for the year ended December 31, 2020 was an addition of $18.3 million which included $9.1 million in the general reserve on both loans held for investment and the related unfunded commitments and $9.2 million in asset-specific provisions related to three loans. The increases during the year are primarily due the specific loss provisions on certain investments and macro economic assumptions that factored in the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For additional information, refer to “Allowance for Credit Losses and Non-Accrual Status” in Note 3, Mortgage Loan Receivables to the consolidated financial statements.
Real Estate Operating Income
The increase of $1.3 million in real estate operating income was primarily attributable to an increase in operations as a result of the easing of restrictions in place due to COVID-19 partially offset by real estate sales.
Sale of Loans, Net
Income (loss) from sale of loans, net, includes all loan sales, whether by securitization, whole loan sales or other means. Income (loss) from sale of loans, net also includes realized losses on loans related to lower of cost or market adjustments. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold/transferred 16 conduit loans with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $251.6 million and one balance sheet loan with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $46.6 million resulting in a net gain of $8.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded no realized losses on loans related to lower of cost or market adjustments. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold/transferred 31 conduit loans with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $313.7 million and eight balance sheet mortgage loan receivables held for investment, net, at amortized cost, with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $280.1 million resulting in a net loss of $1.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded no realized losses on loans related to lower of cost or market adjustments. Income from sales of loans, net is subject to market conditions impacting timing, size and pricing and as such may vary significantly quarter to quarter.
Realized Gain (Loss) on Securities
The realized gain (loss) on securities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1.6 million compared to a realized loss of $(12.4) million for December 31, 2020, which resulted in a net positive change of $14.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold $438.6 million of securities, comprised of $408.2 million of CMBS and $30.4 million of Agency securities. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold $931.9 million of securities, comprised of $913.3 million of CMBS, $4.0 million of corporate bonds and $14.6 million of equity securities. Other than temporary impairments on securities of $(0.1) million are included in realized gain (loss) on securities for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $(0.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Equity Securities
The Company had no equity security activity during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to unrealized gain (loss) of $(0.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company has elected the fair market value option for accounting for these equity securities and changes in fair value are recorded in current period earnings.
Realized Gain (Loss) on Sale of Real Estate, Net
There was an increase of $23.7 million in realized gain (loss) on the sale of real estate. The increase was primarily as a result of the sale of six retail properties for a realized gain of $53.8 million, one apartment property for a realized gain of $4.0 million and a realized loss on a land parcel of $2.0 million which resulted in an aggregate $55.8 million realized gain (loss) for the year
ended December 31, 2021. The realized gain (loss) of $32.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of gains on the sale of 11 diversified commercial real estate properties and one single-tenant net lease property of $27.7 million and $4.4 million, respectively.
Fee and Other Income
We generated fee income from origination fees, exit fees and other fees on the loans we originate and in which we invest, and dividend income on our FHLB stock. The $1.5 million decrease in fee and other income year-over-year was primarily due to a increase in exit fees, offset by a decrease in origination fees and dividend income. Also contributing was a realized loss on our investment in the Ladder Select Bond Fund, which was liquidated on June 22, 2020.
Net Result from Derivative Transactions
Net result from derivative transactions of $1.7 million is composed of a realized gain of $1.7 million and an unrealized gain of $33.8 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a loss of $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was comprised of an unrealized loss of $0.3 million and a realized loss of $15.0 million resulting in a positive change of $17.0 million. The hedge positions were related to fixed rate conduit loans and securities investments. The derivative positions that generated these results were a combination of interest rate futures that we employed in an effort to hedge the interest rate risk on the financing of our fixed rate assets and the net interest income we earn against the impact of changes in interest rates. The gain in 2021 was primarily related to movement in interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2021. The total net result from derivative transactions is comprised of hedging interest expense, realized gains/losses related to hedge terminations and unrealized gains/losses related to changes in the fair value of asset hedges.
Earnings (Loss) from Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
Earnings from our investment in Grace Lake LLC totaled $1.4 million, and $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Earnings (loss) from our investment in 24 Second Avenue totaled $0.2 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 6, Investment in and Advances to Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, for further detail. Our maximum exposure to loss from these investments is limited to the carrying value of our investments. The gain in the year ended December 31, 2020 is attributable to equity and earnings on our investments.
Gain (Loss) on Extinguishment
We had no gain (loss) on extinguishment/defeasance of debt for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company redeemed $146.7 million of principal of the 2021 Notes at par and $465.9 million of principal of the 2022 Notes at par. Gain (loss) on extinguishment/defeasance of debt totaled $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company retired $98.2 million of principal of the 2027 Notes for a repurchase price of $83.9 million, recognizing a $12.9 million net gain on extinguishment of debt after recognizing $(1.3) million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the retired debt, the Company retired $52.0 million of principal of the 2025 Notes for a repurchase price of $45.1 million, recognizing a $6.4 million net gain on extinguishment of debt after recognizing $(0.5) million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the retired debt, the Company retired $34.2 million of principal of the 2022 Notes for a repurchase price of $33.2 million, recognizing a $0.7 million net gain on extinguishment of debt after recognizing $(0.2) million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the retired debt and, the Company retired $119.5 million of principal of the 2021 Notes for a repurchase price of $119.3 million, recognizing a $52.4 thousand net gain on extinguishment of debt after recognizing $(0.2) million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the retired debt.
Compensation and Employee Benefits
Compensation and employee benefits are comprised primarily of salaries, bonuses, equity based compensation and other employee benefits. The decrease of $19.8 million in compensation expense was primarily attributable to a reduction in compensation expense resulting from the timing of the payment of equity based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 along with a reduction in head count for December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses are primarily composed of professional fees, lease expense and technology expenses. The decrease of $2.6 million was primarily related to a decrease in professional fees.
Real Estate Operating Expenses
The decrease of $2.4 million in real estate operating expense is primarily the result of real estate sales throughout 2021.
Fee Expense
Fee expense is comprised primarily of custodian fees, financing costs and servicing fees related to loans. The decrease of $1.4 million in fee expense was primarily attributable to decreased servicer fees as a result of a lower average loan balance due to the the timing of our loan originations in 2021.
Depreciation and Amortization
The $1.3 million decrease in depreciation and amortization is primarily attributable to the timing of the real estate sales and acquisitions during each year.
Income Tax (Benefit) Expense
Most of our consolidated income tax provision related to the business units held in our TRSs. The decrease in benefit of $10.7 million is primarily a result of an increase in income as a result of taxable gains primarily from the sale of loans.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The management of our liquidity and capital diversity and allocation strategies is critical to the success and growth of our business. We manage our sources of liquidity to complement our asset composition and to diversify our exposure across multiple capital markets and counterparties.
We require substantial amounts of capital to support our business. The management team, in consultation with our board of directors, establishes our overall liquidity and capital allocation strategies. A key objective of those strategies is to support the execution of our business strategy while maintaining sufficient ongoing liquidity throughout the business cycle to service our financial obligations as they become due. When making funding and capital allocation decisions, members of our senior management consider business performance; the availability of, and costs and benefits associated with, different funding sources; current and expected capital markets and general economic conditions; our asset composition and capital structure; and our targeted liquidity profile and risks relating to our funding needs.
To ensure that Ladder Capital can effectively address the funding needs of the Company on a timely basis, we maintain a diverse array of liquidity sources including (1) cash and cash equivalents; (2) cash generated from operations; (3) proceeds from the issuance of the unsecured bonds; (4) borrowings under repurchase agreements; (5) principal repayments on investments including mortgage loans and securities; (6) borrowings under our revolving credit facility; (7) proceeds from securitizations and sales of loans; (8) proceeds from the sale of securities; (9) proceeds from the sale of real estate; (10) proceeds from the issuance of CLO debt and other non-mark-to-market loan financing; and (11) proceeds from the issuance of equity capital. We use these funding sources to meet our obligations on a timely basis and have the ability to use our significant unencumbered asset base to further finance our business.
Our primary uses of liquidity are for (1) the funding of loan and real estate-related investments; (2) the repayment of short-term and long-term borrowings and related interest; (3) the funding of our operating expenses; and (4) distributions to our equity investors to comply with the REIT distribution requirements. We require short-term liquidity to fund loans that we originate and hold on our consolidated balance sheet pending sale, including through whole loan sale, participation, or securitization. We generally require longer-term funding to finance the loans and real estate-related investments that we hold for investment. We have historically used the aforementioned funding sources to meet the operating and investment needs as they have arisen and have been able to do so by applying a rigorous approach to long and short-term cash and debt forecasting.
In addition, as a REIT, we are also required to make sufficient dividend payments to our shareholders in amounts at least sufficient to maintain our REIT status. Under IRS guidance, we may elect to pay a portion of our dividends in stock, subject to a cash/stock election by our shareholders, to optimize our level of capital retention. Accordingly, our cash requirement to pay dividends to maintain REIT status could be substantially reduced at the discretion of the board.
Our principal debt financing sources include: (1) long-term senior unsecured notes in the form of corporate bonds; (2) CLO issuances; (3) borrowings on both a short- and long-term committed basis, made by Tuebor from the FHLB; (4) long term non-recourse mortgage financing; (5) committed secured funding provided by banks and other lenders; and (6) uncommitted secured funding sources, including asset repurchase agreements with a number of banks.
In the future, we may also use other sources of financing to fund the acquisition of our assets, including credit facilities, warehouse facilities, repurchase facilities and other secured and unsecured forms of borrowing. These financings may be collateralized or non-collateralized, may involve one or more lenders and may accrue interest at either fixed or floating rates. We may also seek to raise further equity capital or issue debt securities in order to fund our future investments.
Refer to “Financial Covenants” and “Our Financing Strategies” for further disclosure of our diverse financing sources and, for a summary of our financial obligations, refer to the Contractual Obligations table below. All of our existing financial obligations due within the following year can be extended for one or more additional years at our discretion, refinanced or repaid at maturity or are incurred in the normal course of business (i.e., interest payments/loan funding obligations).
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
We held cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $621.5 million at December 31, 2021, of which $548.7 million was unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $72.8 million was restricted cash. We held cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion and restricted cash of $29.9 million as of December 31, 2020. As the COVID-19 crisis evolved in 2020, management implemented a plan to mitigate the uncertainty in financial markets by increasing liquidity and obtaining additional non-recourse and non-mark-to-market financing. The additional liquidity was redeployed into new investments in 2021.
Cash Flows
The following table provides a breakdown of the net change in our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash ($ in thousands):
We experienced a net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $(662.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflecting cash used in operating activities of $79.7 million, cash provided by investing activities of $(651.5) million and cash used in finance activities of $(91.0) million.
Net cash provided by operating activities of $79.7 million was primarily driven by $(220.4) million of originations of mortgage loans held for sale and $(55.8) million of realized gain on sale of real estate, partially offset by $259.1 million of proceeds from sales of mortgage loans held for sale and depreciation and amortization of $37.8 million.
Net cash used in investing activities of $(651.5) million was driven by usage of $(2.3) billion of origination of mortgage loans held for investment, $(247.0) million in purchases of real estate securities, $(63.6) million of purchases of mortgage loans held for investment, and $(20.5) million in purchases of real estate. These uses were partially offset by $1.1 billion of repayment from mortgage loan receivables, $438.6 million of proceeds from sale of real estate securities, $190.9 million proceeds from the sale of real estate, $164.5 million in repayments on securities, and $46.6 million of proceeds from the sale of mortgage loan receivables held for investment.
Net cash used in financing activities of $(91.0) million was primarily as a result of $(100.6) million of dividends payments, $(9.0) million in purchase of treasury shares, $(4.5) million of shares acquired to satisfy minimum federal and state tax withholdings on restricted stock, and $(3.2) million in deferred financing costs partially offset by net borrowings of $25.5 million.
We experienced a net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $928.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflecting cash provided by operating activities of $111.9 million, cash provided by investing activities of $1.5 billion and cash used in finance activities of $(725.7) million.
Net cash provided by operating activities of $111.9 million was primarily driven by our mortgage loan receivable held for investment. This included $312.3 million in proceeds from mortgage loan receivables held for sale, partially offset by $(212.8) million of originations of mortgage loans held for sale.
Net cash provided by investing activities of $1.5 billion was driven by $891.7 million of repayment from mortgage loan receivables, $932.2 million of proceeds from sale of real estate securities, $270.5 million of proceeds from the sale of mortgage loan receivables held for investment, partially offset by $(440.6) million in purchases of real estate securities and $(353.7) million of origination of mortgage loans held for investment.
Net cash used in financing activities of $(725.7) million was primarily as a result of net borrowings of $(593.4) million, $(118.9) million of dividends payments, $(17.1) million of shares acquired to satisfy minimum federal and state tax withholdings on restricted stock and $(18.0) million in deferred financing costs, partially offset by $32.0 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock.
Unencumbered Assets
As of December 31, 2021, we held unencumbered cash of $0.5 billion, unencumbered loans of $1.7 billion, unencumbered securities of $150.9 million, unencumbered real estate of $85.9 million and $358.5 million of other assets not secured by any portion of secured indebtedness.
Borrowings under various financing arrangements
Our financing strategies are critical to the success and growth of our business. We manage our leverage policies to complement our asset composition and to diversify our exposure across multiple counterparties. Our borrowings under various financing arrangements as of December 31, 2021 are set forth in the table below ($ in thousands):
(1)Presented net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $0.3 million as of December 31, 2021.
(2)Presented net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $1.9 million and an unamortized discount of $2.1 million related to the Purchase Right (described in detail under Secured Financing Facility below) at December 31, 2021.
(3)Presented net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $9.6 million as of December 31, 2021.
(4)Presented net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $18.7 million as of December 31, 2021.
The Company’s repurchase facilities include covenants covering minimum net worth requirements (ranging from $400.0 million to $871.4 million), maximum reductions in net worth over stated time periods, minimum liquidity levels (typically $30.0 million of cash or a higher standard that often allows for the inclusion of different percentages of liquid securities in the determination of compliance with the requirement), maximum leverage ratios (calculated in various ways based on specified definitions of indebtedness and net worth) and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25x, and, in the instance of one lender, an interest coverage ratio of 1.50x, in each case, if certain liquidity thresholds are not satisfied. We were in compliance with all
covenants as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Further, certain of our financing arrangements and loans on our real property are secured by the assets of the Company, including pledges of the equity of certain subsidiaries or the assets of certain subsidiaries. From time to time, certain of these financing arrangements and loans may prohibit certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends to the Company, from making distributions on such subsidiary’s capital stock, from repaying to the Company any loans or advances to such subsidiary from the Company or from transferring any of such subsidiary’s property or other assets to the Company or other subsidiaries of the Company.
Committed loan facilities
We are a party to multiple committed loan repurchase agreement facilities, totaling $1.2 billion of credit capacity. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $184.5 million of borrowings outstanding, with an additional $1.0 billion of committed financing available. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $255.4 million of borrowings outstanding, with an additional $1.3 billion of committed financing available. Assets pledged as collateral under these facilities are generally limited to whole mortgage loans collateralized by first liens on commercial real estate, mezzanine loans collateralized by equity interests in entities that own commercial real estate, and certain interests in such first mortgage and mezzanine loans. Our repurchase facilities include covenants covering net worth requirements, minimum liquidity levels, and maximum debt/equity ratios. We believe we were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2021.
We have the option to extend some of our existing facilities subject to a number of customary conditions. The lenders have sole discretion with respect to the inclusion of collateral in these facilities, to determine the market value of the collateral on a daily basis, and, if the estimated market value of the included collateral declines, the lenders have the right to require additional collateral or a full and/or partial repayment of the facilities (margin call), sufficient to rebalance the facilities. Typically, the facilities are established with stated guidelines regarding the maximum percentage of the collateral asset’s market value that can be borrowed. We often borrow at a lower percentage of the collateral asset’s value than the maximum leaving us with excess borrowing capacity that can be drawn upon at a later date and/or applied against future margin calls so that they can be satisfied on a cashless basis.
Committed securities facility
We are a party to a term master repurchase agreement with a major U.S. banking institution for CMBS, totaling $400.0 million of credit capacity, or more depending on our utilization of a loan repurchase facility with the same lender. As we do in the case of borrowings under committed loan facilities, we often borrow at a lower percentage of the collateral asset’s value than the maximum, leaving us with excess borrowing capacity that can be drawn upon a later date and/or applied against future margin calls so that they can be satisfied on a cashless basis. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $44.1 million borrowings outstanding, with an additional $818.7 million of committed financing available. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $149.6 million borrowings outstanding, with an additional $638.4 million of committed financing available.
Uncommitted securities facilities
We are a party to multiple master repurchase agreements with several counterparties to finance our investments in CMBS and U.S. Agency securities. The securities that served as collateral for these borrowings are highly liquid and marketable assets that are typically of relatively short duration.
Revolving credit facility
The Company’s revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) provides for an aggregate maximum borrowing amount of $266.4 million, including a $25.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility is available on a revolving basis to finance the Company’s working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. The Revolving Credit Facility has a current maturity date of February 11, 2022, which may be extended by three 12-month periods subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the absence of default. The Interest on the Revolving Credit Facility is one-month LIBOR plus 3.00% per annum payable monthly in arrears. There were no outstanding draws on the facility as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $266.4 million borrowings outstanding.
The obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a pledge of the shares of (or other ownership or equity interests in) certain subsidiaries to the extent the pledge is not restricted under existing regulations, law or contractual obligations.
LCFH is subject to customary affirmative covenants and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of additional debt, liens, restricted payments, sales of assets and affiliate transactions under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, under the Revolving Credit Facility, LCFH is required to comply with financial covenants relating to minimum net worth, maximum leverage, minimum liquidity, and minimum fixed charge coverage, consistent with our other credit facilities. Our ability to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility will be dependent on, among other things, LCFH’s compliance with the financial covenants. The Revolving Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including non-payment of principal or interest, fees or other amounts, failure to perform or observe covenants, cross-default to other indebtedness, the rendering of judgments against the Company or certain of our subsidiaries to pay certain amounts of money and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency.
Mortgage Loan Financing
We generally finance our real estate using long-term non-recourse mortgage financing. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we executed one term debt agreement to finance real estate. These non-recourse debt agreements provide for fixed rate financing at rates ranging from 3.75% to 6.16%, with anticipated maturity dates between 2022-2031 as of December 31, 2021. These loans have carrying amounts of $693.8 million and $766.1 million, net of unamortized premiums of $3.2 million and $4.6 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, representing proceeds received upon financing greater than the contractual amounts due under these agreements. The premiums are being amortized over the remaining life of the respective debt instruments using the effective interest method. The Company recorded $1.4 million, $1.2 million and $1.6 million of premium amortization, which decreased interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively. The mortgage loans are collateralized by real estate and related lease intangibles, net, of $805.0 million and $909.4 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
Secured Financing Facility
On April 30, 2020, the Company entered into a strategic financing arrangement with an American multinational corporation (the “Lender”), under which the Lender provided the Company with approximately $206.4 million in senior secured financing (the “Secured Financing Facility”) to fund transitional and land loans. The Secured Financing Facility is secured on a first lien basis on a portfolio of certain of the Company’s loans and will mature on May 6, 2023, and borrowings thereunder bear interest at LIBOR (or a minimum of 0.75% if greater) plus 10.0%, with a minimum interest premium clause, of which approximately $5.3 million remains as of December 31, 2021. The Secured Financing Facility is non-recourse, subject to limited exceptions, and does not contain mark-to-market provisions. Additionally, the Secured Financing Facility provides the Company optionality to modify or restructure loans or forbear in exercising remedies, which maximizes the Company’s financial flexibility.
As part of the strategic financing, the Lender also had the ability to make an equity investment in the Company of up to 4.0 million Class A common shares at $8.00 per share, subject to certain adjustments (the “Purchase Right”). The Purchase Right was exercised in full at $8.00 per share on December 29, 2020. In addition, the Lender has agreed not to sell, transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate, mortgage, dispose of or in any way encumber the shares acquired as a result of exercising the Purchase Right for a period of time following the exercise date. In connection with the issuance of the Purchase Right, the Company and the Lender entered into a registration rights agreement, pursuant to which the Company has agreed to provide customary demand and piggyback registration rights to the Lender.
The Purchase Right was classified as equity and the $200.9 million of net proceeds from the original issuance were allocated $192.5 million to the originally issued debt obligation and $8.4 million to the Purchase Right using the relative fair value method. The commitment to issue shares will not be subsequently remeasured. The $8.4 million allocated to the Purchase Right is being treated as a discount to the debt and amortized over the life of the Purchase Right to interest expense.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $132.4 million of borrowings outstanding under the secured financing facility included in debt obligations on its consolidated balance sheets, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $1.9 million and a $2.1 million unamortized discount related to the Purchase Right.
Collateralized Loan Obligations (“CLO”) Debt
On July 13, 2021, a consolidated subsidiary of the Company completed a privately-marketed CLO transaction, which generated $498.2 million of gross proceeds to Ladder, financing $607.5 million of loans (“Contributed July 2021 Loans”) at an 82% advance rate on a matched term, non-mark-to-market and non-recourse basis. A consolidated subsidiary of the Company retained an 18% subordinate and controlling interest in the CLO. The Company retained consent rights over major decisions with respect to the servicing of the Contributed July 2021 Loans, including the right to appoint and replace the special servicer
under the CLO. The CLO is a VIE and the Company was the primary beneficiary and, therefore, consolidated the VIE - See Note 10, Consolidated Variable Interest Entities.
On December 2, 2021, a consolidated subsidiary of the Company completed a privately marketed CLO transaction, which generated $566.2 million of gross proceeds to Ladder, financing $729.4 million of loans (“Contributed December 2021 Loans”) at a maximum 77.6% advance rate on a matched term, non-mark-to-market and non-recourse basis. A consolidated subsidiary of the Company retained an 15.6% subordinate and controlling interest in the CLO. The Company also held two additional tranches as investments totaling 6.8% interest in the CLO. The Company retained consent rights over major decisions with respect to the servicing of the Contributed December 2021 Loans, including the right to appoint and replace the special servicer under the CLO. The CLO is a VIE and the Company was the primary beneficiary and, therefore, consolidated the VIE - See Note 10, Consolidated Variable Interest Entities.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $1.1 billion of matched term, non-mark-to-market and non-recourse CLO debt included in debt obligations on its consolidated balance sheets. Unamortized debt issuance costs of $9.6 million were included in CLO debt as of December 31, 2021.
Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”)
On July 11, 2012, Tuebor, a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, became a member of the FHLB and subsequently drew its first secured funding advances from the FHLB. As of February 19, 2021, pursuant to a final rule adopted by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (the “FHFA”) regarding the eligibility of captive insurance companies, Tuebor’s membership in the FHLB has been terminated, although outstanding advances may remain outstanding until their scheduled maturity dates. Funding for future advance paydowns is expected to be obtained from the natural amortization and/or sales of securities collateral, or from other financing sources. There is no assurance that the FHFA or the FHLB will not take actions that could adversely impact Tuebor’s existing advances.
As of December 31, 2021, Tuebor had $263.0 million of borrowings outstanding, with terms of 0.7 years to 2.75 years (with a weighted average of 1.95 years), interest rates of 0.36% to 2.74% (with a weighted average of 0.96%), and advance rates of 71.7% to 95.7% on eligible collateral. As of December 31, 2021, collateral for the borrowings was comprised of $259.3 million of CMBS and U.S. Agency securities and $42.5 million of cash.
Tuebor is subject to state regulations which require that dividends (including dividends to the Company as its parent) may only be made with regulatory approval. However, there can be no assurance that we would obtain such approval if sought. Largely as a result of this restriction, approximately $2.2 billion of the member’s capital was restricted from transfer via dividend to Tuebor’s parent without prior approval of state insurance regulators at December 31, 2021. To facilitate intercompany cash funding of operations and investments, Tuebor and its parent maintain regulator-approved intercompany borrowing/lending agreements.
Senior unsecured notes
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $1.6 billion of unsecured corporate bonds outstanding. These unsecured financings were comprised of $348.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”), $651.8 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”) and $650.0 million in aggregate principal of 4.75% senior notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes,” and collectively with the 2025 Notes and the 2027 Notes, the “Notes”).
On January 27, 2021, the Company redeemed in full its 5.875% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “2021 Notes”) for $150.9 million. The 2021 Notes were redeemed at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of the indenture governing the 2021 Notes. The redemption of a portion of the 2021 Notes was subject to the condition that the Company’s subsidiary issuers of the 2021 Notes complete a notes offering of not less than $400 million. The issuers waived the condition prior to redeeming the 2021 Notes in full.
On September 15, 2021, the Company redeemed in full its 5.25% Senior Notes due 2022 (the “2022 Notes”) for $478.1 million. The 2021 Notes were redeemed at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of the indenture governing the 2022 Notes.
LCFH issued the Notes with Ladder Capital Finance Corporation (“LCFC”), as co-issuers on a joint and several basis. LCFC is a 100% owned finance subsidiary of LCFH with no assets, operations, revenues or cash flows other than those related to the issuance, administration and repayment of the Notes. The Company and certain subsidiaries of LCFH currently guarantee the obligations under the Notes and the indenture. The Company believes it was in compliance with all covenants of the Notes as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Unamortized debt issuance costs of $18.7 million and $12.9 million are included in senior unsecured notes as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, in accordance with GAAP.
2025 Notes
On September 25, 2017, LCFH issued $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.250% senior notes due October 1, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). The 2025 Notes require interest payments semi-annually in cash in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2018. The 2025 Notes are unsecured and are subject to an unencumbered assets to unsecured debt covenant. The Company may redeem the 2025 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time, or from time to time, prior to their stated maturity upon not less than 15 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption price as specified in the indenture governing the 2025 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. On May 2, 2018, the board of the directors authorized the Company to repurchase any or all of the 2025 Notes from time to time without further approval. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company retired $52.0 million of principal of the 2025 Notes for a repurchase price of $45.1 million, recognizing a $6.4 million net gain on extinguishment of debt after recognizing $(0.5) million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the retired debt. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining $348.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes is due October 1, 2025.
2027 Notes
On January 30, 2020, LCFH issued $750.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior notes due February 1, 2027. The 2027 Notes require interest payments semi-annually in cash in arrears on August 1 and February 1 of each year, beginning on August 1, 2020. The 2027 Notes are unsecured and are subject to an unencumbered assets to unsecured debt covenant. The Company may redeem the 2027 Notes, in whole, at any time, or from time to time, prior to their stated maturity. At any time on or after February 1, 2023, the Company may redeem the 2027 Notes in whole or in part, upon not less than 15 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption price defined in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. Net proceeds of the offering were used to repay secured indebtedness. On February 26, 2020, the board of the directors authorized the Company to repurchase any or all of the 2027 Notes from time to time without further approval. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company retired $98.2 million of principal of the 2027 Notes for a repurchase price of $83.9 million, recognizing a $12.9 million net gain on extinguishment of debt after recognizing $(1.3) million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the retired debt. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining $651.8 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes is due February 1, 2027.
2029 Notes
On June 23, 2021, LCFH issued $650.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.75% senior notes due June 15, 2029. The 2029 Notes require interest payments semi-annually in cash in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning December 15, 2021. The 2029 Notes are unsecured and are subject to an unencumbered asset to unsecured debt covenant. The Company may redeem the 2029 Notes, in whole, at any time, or from time to time, prior to their stated maturity.

Net proceeds of the offering were used for general corporate purposes, including funding the Company’s pipeline of new loans, investments in its core business lines and repayment of indebtedness. On June 24, 2021, the board of the directors authorized the Company to repurchase any or all of the 2029 Notes from time to time without further approval. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining $650.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes is due June 15, 2029.
Stock Repurchases
On August, 4, 2021, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of $50.0 million of the Company’s Class A common stock from time to time without further approval. This authorization increased the remaining authorization per the October 30, 2014 authorization at the time of $35.0 million to $50.0 million. Stock repurchases by the Company are generally made for cash in open market transactions at prevailing market prices but may also be made in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and amount of purchases are determined based upon prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has a remaining amount available for repurchase of $44.1 million, which represents 2.9% in the aggregate of its outstanding Class A common stock, based on the closing price of $11.99 per share on such date. Refer to Item 1 - “Financial Statements-Note 11, Equity Structure and Accounts” for disclosure of the Company’s repurchase activity.
The following table is a summary of the Company’s repurchase activity of its Class A common stock during the year ended December 31, 2021 ($ in thousands):
(1) Amount excludes commissions paid associated with share repurchases.
Dividends
In order for the Company to maintain its qualification as a REIT under the Code, it must annually distribute at least 90% of its taxable income. The Company has paid and in the future intends to declare regular quarterly distributions to its shareholders in aggregating to an amount approximating at least 90% of the REIT’s annual net taxable income. Refer to Item 1 -“Financial Statements and Supplemental Data-Note 11, Equity Structure and Accounts” for disclosure of dividends declared.
Principal repayments on investments
We receive principal amortization on our loans and securities as part of the normal course of our business. Repayment of mortgage loan receivables provided net cash of $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $892.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Repayment of real estate securities provided net cash of $164.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $146.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Proceeds from securitizations and sales of loans
We sell our conduit mortgage loans to securitization trusts and to other third parties as part of our normal course of business and from time to time will sell balance sheet mortgage loans. There were $305.6 million of proceeds from sales of mortgage loans for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $582.8 million of sales of mortgage loans for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Proceeds from the sale of securities
We sell our investments in CMBS, U.S. Agency securities, corporate bonds and equity securities as a part of our normal course of business. Proceeds from sales of securities provided net cash of $438.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $932.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Proceeds from the sale of real estate
Proceeds from sales of real estate provided net cash of $190.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $44.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Proceeds from the issuance of equity
For the year ended December 31, 2021, there were no proceeds realized in connection with the issuance of equity. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we raised $32.0 million of proceeds in connection with the issuance of 4.0 million shares of our Class A common stock. We may issue additional equity in the future.
Other potential sources of financing
In the future, we may also use other sources of financing to fund the acquisition of our assets, including credit facilities, warehouse facilities, repurchase facilities and other secured and unsecured forms of borrowing. These financings may be collateralized or non-collateralized, may involve one or more lenders and may accrue interest at either fixed or floating rates. We may also seek to raise further equity capital or issue debt securities in order to fund our future investments.
Contractual obligations
Contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021 were as follows ($ in thousands):
(1) As more fully disclosed in Note 7, Debt Obligations, Net, the allocation of repayments under our committed loan repurchase facilities and Secured Financing Facility is based on the earlier of (i) the maturity date of each agreement, or (ii) the maximum maturity date of the collateral loans, assuming all extension options are exercised by the borrower.
(2) Total does not include $1.1 billion of consolidated CLO debt obligations and the related debt issuance costs of $9.6 million, as the satisfaction of these liabilities will not require cash outlays from us.
(3) Comprised of interest on secured financings and on senior unsecured notes. For borrowings with variable interest rates, we used the rates in effect as of December 31, 2021 to determine the future interest payment obligations.
(4) Comprised primarily of our off-balance sheet unfunded commitment to provide additional first mortgage loan financing as of December 31, 2021.
The table above does not include amounts due under our derivative agreements as those contracts do not have fixed and determinable payments. Our contractual obligations will be refinanced and/or repaid from earnings as well as amortization and sales of our liquid collateral. We have made investments in various unconsolidated joint ventures of which our maximum exposure to loss from these investments is limited to the carrying value of our investments. Refer to Note 6 - Investments in and advances made on unconsolidated joint ventures for further detail.
Future Liquidity Needs
In addition to the future contractual obligations above, the Company, in the coming year and beyond, as a part of its normal course of business will require cash to fund unfunded loan commitments and new investments in a combination of balance sheet mortgage loans, conduit loans, real estate investments and securities as it deems appropriate as well as necessary expenses as a part of general corporate purposes. These new investments and general corporate expenses may be funded with existing cash, proceeds from loan and securities payoffs, through financing using our revolving credit facility or loan and security financing facilities, or these could be funded through additional debt or equity facility raises. The Company has no known material cash requirements other than its contractual obligations in the above table, unfunded commitments and future general corporate expenses.
Unfunded Loan Commitments
We may be a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our borrowers. These commitments are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2021, our off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of $390.1 million of unfunded commitments of mortgage loan receivables held for investment, 52% of which additional funds relate to the occurrence of certain “good news” events, such as the owner concluding a lease agreement with a major tenant in the building or reaching some pre-determined net operating income. As of December 31, 2020, our off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of $148.8 million of unfunded commitments of mortgage loan receivables held for investment to provide additional first mortgage loan financing. Such commitments are subject to our borrowers’ satisfaction of certain financial and nonfinancial covenants and involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Commitments are subject to our loan borrowers’ satisfaction of certain financial and nonfinancial covenants and may or may not be funded depending on a variety of circumstances including timing, credit metric hurdles, and other nonfinancial events occurring. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the progress of work generally and, depending on specific property locations, the progress of capital expenditures, construction, and leasing, which have been delayed and/or slower paced than originally anticipated. The progress of those particular projects located in states or local municipalities with continuing restrictions on such activities is anticipated to remain slower to complete than otherwise underwritten at loan origination, and the timing and amounts of our future funding commitments are likely to be slower and possibly diminished by our clients’ changing business plans to adapt to market conditions.
LIBOR Transition
We continue to develop and implement plans for the discontinuation of LIBOR. Specifically, we: (i) have implemented or are in the process of implementing fallback language for our LIBOR-based mortgage loans, bi-lateral committed repurchase facilities and revolving credit facility, including adjustments as applicable to maintain the anticipated economic terms of the existing contracts, (ii) continue to monitor the transition guidance provided by the ARRC, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc., the Financial Accounting Standards Board and other relevant regulators, agencies and industry working groups, and (iii) continue to engage with clients, lenders, market participants and other industry leaders as the transition from LIBOR progresses.
Interest Rate Environment
The nature of the Company’s business exposes it to market risk arising from changes in interest rates. Changes, both increases and decreases, in the rates the Company is able to charge its borrowers, the yields the Company is able to achieve in its securities investments, and the Company’s cost of borrowing directly impacts its net income. The Company’s net interest income includes interest from both fixed and floating-rate debt. The percentage of the Company’s assets and liabilities bearing interest at fixed and floating rates may change over time, and asset composition may differ materially from debt composition. Refer to
