Executive Summary
COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. Our stores have experienced temporary closures, and we have implemented precautionary measures in line with guidance from local authorities in the stores that were open. The COVID-19 pandemic has also significantly impacted our supply chain. In particular, we have experienced disruptions and delays in shipments and increases in the pricing of certain components of our products. The receipt of inventory sourced from areas impacted by COVID-19 has been slowed or disrupted and our manufacturers have also faced similar challenges in receiving raw materials and fulfilling our orders. In addition, there is significant inflationary pressure on ocean and air freight costs as capacity issues and port congestions continue to persist due to the post pandemic demand levels.
Recent Developments
During fiscal year 2021, we acquired the remaining 49.9% non-controlling interest of our European and our South African joint ventures for the total cash consideration of $18,942. In addition, we acquired the rights for Dolce Vita Handbags for a cash consideration of $2,000. For additional information on these acquisitions, refer to Note E - Acquisitions in the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
Key Highlights
Total revenue for 2021 increased by 55.3% to $1,866,142 from $1,201,814 in 2020, with increases in all segments as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on prior year results.
Net income attributable to Steven Madden, Ltd. was $190,678 in 2021 compared to net loss attributable to Steven Madden, Ltd. of $(18,397) in 2020. Our effective tax rate for 2021 decreased to 20.5% compared to 39.0% recorded in 2020. Diluted earnings per share in 2021 was $2.34 per share on 81,628 diluted weighted average shares outstanding compared to diluted loss of $(0.23) per share on 78,635 diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the prior year.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 214 brick-and-mortar retail stores and six e-commerce websites in operation, compared to 211 brick-and-mortar retail stores and seven e-commerce websites as of December 31, 2020. This increase resulted from the opening of eight brick-and-mortar stores partially offset by the closure of five brick-and-mortar stores and one e-commerce website. We did not report same store sales or sales per square foot data in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent temporary closures of our brick-and-mortar stores from the second half of March through at least the end of May and subsequent mandated closures globally in the prior year.
Our inventory turnover (calculated on a trailing four quarter average) for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was 6.4 times and 7.1 times, respectively. Our total company accounts receivable average collection days were 67 days in 2021 compared to 73 days in 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had $263,536 in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, no debt and total stockholders’ equity of $820,538. Working capital increased to $509,470 as of December 31, 2021, compared to $462,325 on December 31, 2020. The increase in working capital was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year.
As we look ahead, we remain focused on delivering trend-right product, deepening connections with our consumers, enhancing our digital commerce business, expanding our non-footwear categories, growing our international business and efficiently managing our inventory and expenses while continuing to make meaningful progress on our corporate social responsibility initiatives.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Year Ended December 31, 2021 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2020
Consolidated:
Total revenue in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased 55.3% to $1,866,142 compared to $1,201,814 for fiscal 2020, with increases in the Direct-to-Consumer, Wholesale Footwear and Wholesale Accessories/Apparel segments. Gross profit was $767,497, or 41.1% of total revenue, as compared to $464,541, or 38.7% of total revenue, in the prior year. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of total revenue was due to a higher penetration of our Direct-to-Consumer segment and lower promotional activity. The increase was partially offset by headwinds in connection with inbound freight costs and the non-renewal of the Generalized System of Preferences ("GSP"), which impacted imports from Cambodia in our handbag business. Operating expenses in 2021 were $519,848, or 27.9%, of total revenue, as compared to $414,978, or 34.5% of total revenue, in the prior year. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue was primarily attributable to greater leverage on higher revenue, gain on sale of a trademark for $8,000, and our expense control initiatives, partially offset by early lease termination and modification charges, and change in valuation of our contingent considerations.
In the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 impairment charges of $1,432 and $36,895, respectively, related to lease right-of-use assets and fixed assets were recorded. In the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded impairment charges of $2,620 and $44,273 associated with certain intangibles. In the year ended December 31, 2021, income from operations increased to $243,597, or 13.1% of total revenue, as compared to a loss from operations of ($31,605), or (2.6%) of total revenue, in the prior-year. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 20.5% compared to 39.0% last year. The primary changes between the Company’s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are due to the year-over-year benefit resulting from the exercising and vesting of share-based awards, a decrease in tax benefit related to a 2020 net operating loss carryback claim set forth by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), a decrease in the GILTI tax and an increase in pre-tax income in jurisdictions with higher tax rates. Net income attributable to Steven Madden, Ltd. for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $190,678 compared to a net loss attributable to Steven Madden, Ltd. of $(18,397) for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of Wholesale Footwear revenue was primarily attributable to greater leverage from higher revenue, a gain on sale of a trademark for $8,000, and our expense control initiatives. For 2020, intangible impairment charges of $16,345 were recorded. Income from operations increased to $217,163, or 21.2% of Wholesale Footwear revenue in 2021 as compared to $91,887, or 12.9% of Wholesale Footwear revenue, in 2020.

In the year ended December 31, 2021 an impairment charge of $651 related to lease right-of-use assets and fixed assets was recorded.

The 103.8% increase in revenue was driven by the continued strength in our e-commerce business and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year, primarily in our brick-and-mortar retail store business. We opened eight full-price stores and closed five full-price stores, along with one e-commerce store during the year ended December 31, 2021 and ended the period with 214 brick-and-mortar stores and six e-commerce sites compared to 211 brick-and-mortar stores and seven e-commerce sites as of December 31, 2020. As a result of COVID-19 related closures of certain brick-and-mortar stores in 2020 and 2021, we did not report comparable store sales for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, gross profit was $315,416, or 64.6% of Direct-to-Consumer revenue, compared to $154,205, or 64.4% of Direct-to-Consumer revenue, in the twelve months of 2020.

The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue was primarily attributable to a deleverage on a lower sales base, but was also impacted by the impairment of lease right-of-use assets and fixed assets, early lease termination and modification charges, and restructuring and other related charges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase was partially offset by our reduction in workforce, furloughs, temporary salary reductions and reduced discretionary spending as a result of our initiatives to control expenses, along with the change in valuation of contingent considerations.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in financing activities was $184,653, which consisted of share repurchases of $123,161, cash dividends paid of $49,161, the acquisition of increased ownership in our joint ventures for $18,942, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $9,732.
Contractual Obligations
Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021 were as follows:
Substantially all our products are produced by independent manufacturers at overseas locations, the majority of which are located in China, with a growing percentage located in Cambodia, Mexico, Brazil and some European nations. We have not entered into any long-term manufacturing or supply contracts with any of these foreign manufacturers. We believe that a sufficient number of alternative sources exist outside of the United States for the manufacture of our products. Purchases are made primarily in United States dollars.
We have employment agreements with our Creative and Design Chief, Steven Madden, and certain executive officers, which provide for the payment of compensation aggregating to approximately $10,525 in 2022, $9,200 in 2023 and $1,172 in 2024. In addition, some of these employment agreements provide for discretionary bonuses and some provide for incentive compensation based on various performance criteria as well as other benefits, including stock-related compensation.
Transition tax of $13,284 was the result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act"). For further information, refer to Note O - Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Excluded from the contractual obligations table above are long-term taxes payable of $1,145 as of December 31, 2021 primarily related to uncertain tax positions, for which we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond one year due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.
Dividends
In February 2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share on our outstanding shares of common stock. The dividend was paid on March 26, 2021, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 16, 2021. We paid total cash dividends for the three months ended March 31, 2021 of $12,425.
In April 2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share on our outstanding shares of common stock. The dividend was paid on June 25, 2021, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 15, 2021. We paid total cash dividends for the three months ended June 30, 2021 of $12,347.
In July 2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share on our outstanding shares of common stock. The dividend was paid on September 27, 2021, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 17, 2021. We paid total cash dividends for the three months ended September 30, 2021 of $12,218.
In November 2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share on our outstanding shares of common stock. The dividend was paid on December 27, 2021, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 17, 2021. We paid total cash dividends for the three months ended December 31, 2021 of $12,171.
On February 23, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend. The quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share is payable on March 25, 2022 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 11, 2022.
Future quarterly cash dividend payments are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and contingent upon future earnings, our financial condition, capital requirements, general business conditions, and other factors. Therefore, we can give no assurance that cash dividends will be paid to holders of our common stock in the future.
Inflation
Inflation and cost pressures including increasing raw material, labor and freight costs have had a significant impact on our profitability in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and elevated prices are expected to continue in 2022. We have minimized the impact of product, wage and freight cost increases by raising prices, renegotiating costs, changing suppliers and improving operating efficiencies. However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to offset any such inflationary cost increases in the future.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND THE USE OF ESTIMATES
Management believes the following critical accounting estimates are more significantly affected by judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: allowance for bad debts; customer returns, chargebacks, markdowns and co-op advertising; inventory valuation; valuation of intangible assets, and impairment of long-lived assets. Our estimates are made based upon historical factors, current circumstances and the experience and judgment of management. Assumptions and estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis, and we may employ outside experts to assist in evaluations.
Allowances for bad debts. Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may be uncollectible in the future. Estimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable, assessments of collectability based on historical trends, the financial condition of our customers and an evaluation of economic conditions. In general, the actual bad debt losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances we have established. The reserve against our non-factored trade receivables also includes estimated losses that may result from customers’ inability to pay.
Markdowns, customer returns, chargebacks and co-op advertising. We provide variable consideration to our customers for chargebacks, discounts, co-op advertising, returns and other miscellaneous deductions that relate to the current period. The amount of the consideration for returns, discounts and compliance chargebacks is determined by analyzing aged receivables, current economic conditions, the prevailing retail environment and historical dilution levels for customers. We evaluate anticipated customer markdowns and chargebacks by reviewing several performance indicators for our major customers. These performance indicators (which include inventory levels on the retail floors, sell through rates and gross margin levels) are analyzed by management to estimate the amount of the anticipated customer allowance. Under our co-op advertising programs, we agree to reimburse the retailer for a portion of the costs incurred by the retailer to advertise and promote some of our products. We estimate the costs of co-op advertising programs based on the terms of the agreements with its retailer customers. Failure to correctly estimate the amount of the reserve could materially impact our results of operations and financial position.
Inventory valuation. Inventories are stated at lower of cost or net realizable value, on a first-in, first-out basis. We review inventory on a regular basis for excess and slow-moving inventory. The review is based on an analysis of inventory on hand, prior sales, and expected net realizable value through future sales. The analysis includes a review of inventory quantities on hand at period-end in relation to year-to-date sales and projections for sales in the foreseeable future as well as subsequent sales. We consider quantities on hand in excess of estimated future sales to be at risk for market impairment. The net realizable value, or market value, is determined based on the estimate of sales prices of such inventory through off-price or discount store channels. The likelihood of any material inventory write-down is dependent primarily on the expectation of future consumer demand for our products. A misinterpretation or misunderstanding of future consumer demand for our products, the economy, or other failure to estimate correctly, in addition to abnormal weather patterns, could result in inventory valuation changes, compared to the valuation determined to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date.
Valuation of intangible assets and goodwill. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually. This accounting guidance also requires that intangible assets with finite lives be amortized over their respective lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are assessed for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment that evaluates relevant events or circumstances in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible or a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Factors considered include historical financial performance, macroeconomic and industry conditions and legal and regulatory environment. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount, and if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, an impairment is recognized equal to the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter or if impairment indicators warrant a test.
Impairment of long-lived assets. We perform an impairment review of our long-lived assets, once events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management’s judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. When such a determination has been made, management compares the carrying value of the asset groups with their estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If it is determined that an impairment has occurred, the fair value of the asset group is determined and compared to its carrying value. The excess of the carrying value over the fair value, if any, is recognized as a loss during that period. The impairment is calculated as the difference between asset carrying values and the fair value of the long-lived assets.
