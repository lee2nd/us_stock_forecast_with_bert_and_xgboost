Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Overview
Hero Technologies Inc. is an early stage cannabis company. The company has a majority stake in BlackBox Systems and Technologies LLC. BlackBox is an aeroponic cannabis cultivation system that provides optimal conditions to enhance photosynthesis and cultivation of large flowering plants, creating increased efficiencies. The BlackBox project consists of environmental growth chambers for the cultivation of large flowering plants based on aeroponic technology. Hero Technologies owns and operates HighlyRelaxing.com under Highly Relaxing LLC. The Company also operates VeteranHempCo.com after the acquisition of V Brokers LLC assets.
Our flagship project, Blackbox has applied to the state of Michigan for marijuana licenses which, if granted, will allow Blackbox to cultivate cannabis for sale in the state of Michigan. Blackbox is currently seeking two Michigan marijuana licenses, one for adult use and one for medicinal use. The current status of Blackbox’s marijuana license may be summarized as follows:
Our flagship project, Blackbox has applied to the state of Michigan for marijuana licenses which, if granted, will allow Blackbox to cultivate cannabis for sale in the state of Michigan. Blackbox is currently seeking two Michigan marijuana licenses, one for adult use and one for medicinal use. The current status of Blackbox’s marijuana license may be summarized as follows:
·
Blackbox is in the process of pursuing a Class C license, which would permit them to cultivate up to 2,000 marijuana plants for adult use and 1,500 plants for medicinal use.
·
To date, Blackbox has spent approximately $190,577 in pursuit of a marijuana license.
·
Per the MRA, Blackbox is required to pay an initial fee of $40,000 for each license.
·
Blackbox is required to pay a renewal fee for every year that they wish to retain their license. The fee for renewing a marijuana license can range from $30,000 to $50,000, depending on the total weight of the marijuana plants that were cultivated for the preceding year.
·
These licenses will allow Blackbox to cultivate cannabis, within the state of Michigan, for adult use and medicinal use.
·
Blackbox has already completed Step 1 in the application process. However, before Blackbox can submit an application for Step 2, Blackbox is required to complete construction of its greenhouse facilities.
·
Once the facilities are complete, Blackbox may proceed with a Step 2 application, which entails having the newly constructed facility inspected by the Bureau of Fire Services within 60 days after the Step 2 application is submitted.
·
Failure to pass an inspection by the BFS within 60 days may result in the denial of the license.
·
Blackbox is also required, by the MRA, to disclose the sources and total amount of capitalization that is required to operate and maintain a proposed marijuana facility. For a Class C license, Blackbox is required to show that they have $500,000 available to operate and maintain the facility.
·
Completing the Step 2 process will allow the company to proceed with the cultivation of cannabis in Michigan.
Once Blackbox receives a Class C marijuana license for adult use, they will be subject to various provisions and obligations, including the following:
·
Under rule 420.102(1), one who holds a Class C marijuana license for adult use is permitted to grow 2,000 marijuana plants
·
According to rule 420.102(4) of the MRA, A marijuana grower license authorizes a marijuana grower to transfer marijuana without using a marijuana secure transporter to a marijuana processor or marijuana retailer if both of the following are met:
o
(a) The marijuana processor or marijuana retailer occupies the same location as the marijuana grower and the marijuana is transferred using only private real property without accessing public roadways.
o
(b) The marijuana grower enters each transfer into the statewide monitoring system.
·
Pursuant to rule 420.102(5), A marijuana grower license authorizes sale of marijuana, other than seeds, seedlings, tissue cultures, immature plants, and cuttings, to a marijuana processor or marijuana retailer.
·
Under rule 420.102(7), A marijuana grower must enter all transactions, current inventory, and other information into the statewide monitoring system, known as METRC, as required in these rules. Under the METRC system:
·
a serialized tag must be attached to every plant,
·
and labels must be attached to wholesale packages
·
According to rule 420.102(8), A marijuana grower license does not authorize the marijuana grower to operate in an area unless the area is zoned for industrial or agricultural use. At present, the Company is in compliance with this rule, as we intend to operate in an area that has been zoned for industrial and agricultural use.
·
Under 420.102(9), A marijuana grower may accept the transfer of marijuana seeds, tissue cultures, and clones that do not meet the definition of marijuana plant in these rules at any time from another grower licensed under the acts, these rules, or both. Marijuana.
·
Per rule 420.102(11), A marijuana grower licensee is required to comply with the requirements of the Michigan regulation and taxation of marijuana act and these rules.
With regard to a Class C marijuana license for medicinal use, the MRA imposes very similar provisions and obligations to those state above. According to rule R 420.108 of the MRA, one who possess a Class C marijuana license for medical use is subject to the following obligations:
·
Under rule 420.108(1), one who holds a Class C marijuana license for medicinal use is only permitted to grow marijuana1,500 marijuana plants, as opposed to the 2,000 plants authorized for those who obtain an adult-use license
·
Similar to the rule governing an adult-use license, marijuana under rule 420.108(3), a medicinal-use license authorizes a grower to transfer marijuana without using a secure transporter to a processor or provisioning center if both of the following are met:
o
(a) The processor or provisioning center occupies the same location as the grower and the marijuana is transferred using only private real property without accessing public roadways.
o
(b) The grower enters each transfer into the statewide monitoring system.
·
According to rule 420.108(4), a grower license authorizes sale of marijuana, other than seeds, seedlings, tissue cultures, and cuttings, to a processor or a provisioning center.
·
To be eligible for a grower license, the applicant and each investor in the grower must not have an interest in a secure transporter or safety compliance facility.
·
Under rule 420.108(7), a medicinal-use license, like an adult-use license, requires a grower to enter all transactions, current inventory, and other information into the statewide monitoring system, known as METRC
·
Similar to the rule for an adult-use license, under rule 420.108(8), a medicinal-use license does not authorize the grower to operate in an area unless the area is zoned for industrial or agricultural use. As mentioned, the Company is in compliance with this rule, as we intend to operate in an area that has been zoned for industrial and agricultural use.
Our goal is to become a low-cost national or internationally branded cannabis company. Through cost measurement methods unused elsewhere by the industry, we will be able to measure costs of production by pound. With this information, we will target production costs of $150 to $350 per pound, and estimate selling cannabis at wholesale prices between $2,400 and $3,200. The end goal is to become a Multi-State Operator (MSO) that is fully integrated from seed to sale
However, there are numerous other developments that will need to occur in order to allow us to implement the final aspects of our business plan and there are no assurances that any of these developments will occur, or if they do occur, that we will be successful in fully implementing our plan.
Since inception of Hero Technologies, we have devoted the majority of our resources to acquiring assets and subsidiaries, organizing and staffing our company, business planning and execution, and raising capital.
·
We have incurred recurring losses, the majority of which is attributable to minimal revenue, compensation expenses, consulting expenses, loss on the sale of a subsidiary, and losses on share conversion.
·
We have funded our operations primarily through issuance of shares for services and proceeds from sale of stock.
·
Our net loss was $5,957,927 for the year ended December 31, 2020, and $3,419,621 for the year ended December 31, 2021.
·
As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $38,856,110.
·
Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of compensation expenses, consulting expenses, and general and administrative expenditures.
As of December 31, 2021, only Veteran Hemp Co. has generated any revenue.
Material changes in our Statement of Operations for the periods shown below compared to the prior periods are discussed below:
Year ended December 31, 2021
Factors that will most significantly affect future operating results will be:
·
Funding for construction of greenhouses in Michigan under Blackbox
·
Timing related to construction and actual production of cannabis
·
Wholesale cannabis prices in the state of Michigan
Other than the foregoing we do not know of any trends, events or uncertainties that have had, or are reasonably expected to have, a material impact on our revenues or expenses.
Results of Operations
Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.
Revenue and Cost of Goods Sold
Sales increased by $1,328 for the year ended December 31, 2021. This is a slight increase from the year 2020, in which the sales totaled $197. Cost of Goods sold similarly increased by $72,686.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses decreased from $5,838,296 to $1,176,442. This decline was driven by a decrease in consulting expenses, compensation expenses, and office, travel, and general expenses. Increases in professional fees were driven by licensing activity.
Consulting
Consulting expenses increased from $209,070 to $421,908. This increase was driven by licensing and marketing activity, as well as other operating expenses.
Compensation
Compensation expenses decreased from $5,317,100 to $383,190. Compensation was significantly higher in the year 2020 due to the issuance of stock-based compensation.
Professional Fees
Professional fees increased from $58,077 to $199,605. This increase was driven by cannabis licensing projects in Michigan and Massachusetts, as well as debt funding attorneys in Michigan.
Our Energy and Exploration Legacy and Transition to Cannabis
The Company underwent significant changes from the year 2019 to 2020, which caused fluctuations in the various operating costs. Before its name change in 2020, the Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada under the name “Holloman Energy Corporation.” The Company had previously focused on oil and gas exploration in Australia’s Cooper Basin. However, during 2019, the Company sold its remaining oil and gas assets and discontinued operations in the energy industry. On May 1, 2020, Holloman Energy Corporation Series A Preferred Shares were purchased by Magenta Value Holdings LLC. On July 20, 2020, the Company changed its name to Hero Technologies Inc. with the state of Nevada. After which, the Company begun making the transition into the cannabis industry.
On September 10, 2020, Hero Technologies Inc. formed the company Blackbox Technologies and Systems LLC and entered into an operating agreement. The name was subsequently changed to Blackbox Systems and Technologies LLC. The Blackbox project consists of environmental growth chambers for the cultivation of large flowering plants based on aeroponic technology. On November 3, 2020, the Company purchased Veteran Hemp Co., which operates an international retail and wholesale online store selling cannabis and cannabidiol. On November 4, 2020, the Company purchased a www.highlrelaxing.com and began selling CBD topicals and rubs under the name “Highly Relaxing”. Today, Hero Technologies Inc. is a cannabis company with a vertically integrated business model and plan that includes cannabis genetic engineering, farmland for medical and recreational cannabis cultivation, production licenses, distribution licenses, consumer packaging, retail operations and dispensaries. The Company focuses on two principal segments of the cannabis industry, (i) cultivation and (ii) the dispensary business model, including combinations. The Company is an expanding vertically integrated, cannabis operator, focusing on high-growth markets. Hero Technologies Inc. pairs premier seed genetics and growing techniques, with plans to utilize and expand its growing technology/techniques to all its facilities and operations. The Company's business model includes cultivation, licensing operations, processing operations, processing facilities, sale of products, brand creation, and technology development.
Capital Resources and Liquidity
Overview
Since our inception, we have recognized limited revenue from our core cannabis operations and have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We have not yet commercialized any product from our planned aeroponic cultivation of cannabis, and we do not expect to generate revenue until completion of greenhouse buildouts. Since our inception through December 2021, we have funded our operations through proceeds from the sale of stock, borrowings on debt, and shares issued for service. We expect our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with the anticipated net proceeds from this offering, to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future.
Our sources and (uses) of cash for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are shown below:
Our material capital commitments for the twelve months ending December 31, 2022 are:
Operating Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we used $345,794 of cash in operating activities. Cash used in operating activities reflected our net loss of $5,957,927, offset by a $173,000 increase in our operating assets and liabilities and noncash charges of approximately $5,400,000, which was driven by stock-based compensation. The primary use of cash was to fund our operations related to compensation.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we used $732,649 of cash in operating activities. Cash used in operating activities reflected our net loss of $3,419,621 and a net increase of $150,431 in our operating assets and liabilities, offset by approximately $2,629,869 of noncash charges, which was driven by loss from conversion of debt to common stock. The primary use of cash was to fund our operations related to compensation expenses, consulting expenses, and professional fees.
Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020 we used $2,331 for fixed assets. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we received $0 for investing activities.
Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, financing activities provided $716,000 for proceeds from the sale of stock. During the year ended December 31, 2021, financing activities provided $470,000, which was borrowed on debt and proceeds from the sale of stock.
We anticipate material capital requirements of $9,000,000 for the twelve months ending December 31, 2022.
Other than as disclosed above, we do not know of any trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in, or that are reasonably likely to result in, our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.
Other than as disclosed above, we do not know of any significant changes in our expected sources and uses of cash.
We do not have any commitments or arrangements from any person to provide us with any equity capital.
Our current losses, working capital deficit, and accumulated deficit raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Our current operations are being funded by capital that has been raised through the issuance of capital stock. Additionally, we may decide to raise more capital in the future through private offerings, public offerings, and/or debt offerings.
Funding Requirements
Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, primarily consisting of compensation, consulting and professional fees and general administrative expenses.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated the cannabis industry, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:
·
Regulatory and statutory developments regarding the legalization and commercialization of the marijuana industry in the United States
·
Compensation expenses related to our growing platform
·
Business development opportunities in the form of targeted acquisitions of subsidiaries
·
Investment activities related to the construction and deployment of aeroponic growth technology.
We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the cannabis industry and our core businesses, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings and/or debt financings. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of common stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate the implementation of our business plans.
Critical Accounting Policies
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies, defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
See Note 2 to the December 31, 2021 Financial Statements included as part of this document for a summary of our significant accounting policies.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. It is possible that accounting estimates and assumptions may be material to the Company due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved.
Accounts Receivable
The Company grants credit to customers under credit terms that it believes are customary in the industry and does not require collateral to support customer receivables. The Company currently does not provide an allowance for doubtful collections, which is based upon a review of outstanding receivables, historical collection information, and existing economic conditions. Normal receivable terms vary from 30-90 days after the issuance of the invoice and typically would be considered past due when the term expires. Delinquent receivables are written off based on individual credit evaluation and specific circumstances of the customer.
Inventory
Inventory is valued at the lower of the inventory's cost (first in, first out basis) or the current market price of the inventory. Management compares the cost of inventory with its market value and an allowance is made to write down inventory to market value, if lower.
Long-Lived Assets
The Company applies the provisions of ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. ASC 360 requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying amounts. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the long-lived assets. Loss on long-lived assets to be disposed of is determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for the cost of disposal.
Revenue Recognition
Net sales include product sales, less excise taxes and customer programs and incentives. The Company recognizes revenue by applying the following steps in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied.
The Company recognizes sales when merchandise is shipped from a warehouse directly to wholesale customers (except in the case of a consignment sale). For consignment sales, the Company recognizes sales upon the consignee’s shipment to the customer. Postage and handling charges billed to customers are also recognized as sales upon shipment of the related merchandise. Shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point, and title passes to the customer at the time and place of shipment or purchase by customers at a retail location. For consignment sales, title passes to the consignee concurrent with the consignee’s shipment to the customer. The customer has no cancellation privileges after shipment or upon purchase at retail locations, other than customary rights of return. The Company excludes sales tax collected and remitted to various states from sales and cost of sales
Deferred Income
In some instances, the Company receives payments prior to delivery of its products, whereupon such revenues are deferred until the revenue recognition criteria are met.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. FASB ASC Topic 718 requires companies to measure compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation at fair value at the grant date and recognize the expense over the employee's requisite service period. The Company recognizes in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees and non-employees.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.
Going Concern
Our net losses through December 31, 2021 raise some or substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business. The amendments in this update clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date. The Company does not believe the adoption of ASU 2017-04 had any material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Competition
We face extreme competition from both larger, better-financed national brands as well as an ever-increasing number of boutique service providers in the cannabis industry. We currently track sixty-nine (69) such providers in this space and are continually monitoring their progress and presence in the industry while working to continue to demonstrate our unique licensing offering. We also track eighty-eight (88) public companies that are either directly in or loosely involved in the cannabis industry.
Regulatory Considerations
Marijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal laws.
As of the date of this Prospectus 36 states and the District of Columbia allow its citizens to use Medical Marijuana. Additionally, 15 states and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis for recreational use by adults. The state laws are in conflict with the Federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level. The Biden Administration, if it follows Obama Administration policies, is not likely to use of resources to direct law federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana. However, there is no guarantee that the Administration will not change its stated policy regarding the low-priority enforcement of federal laws. Additionally, any new administration that follows could change this policy and decide to enforce the federal laws strongly. Any such change in the Federal Government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us.
The Department of Justice has stated that it will continue to enforce the Controlled Substance Act with respect to marijuana to prevent:
·
the distribution of marijuana to minors;
·
criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels receiving revenue from the sale of marijuana;
·
the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law to other states;
·
state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;
·
violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana;
·
driving while impaired and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use;
·
the growing of marijuana on public lands; and
·
marijuana possession or use on federal property.
Laws and regulations affecting the medical marijuana industry are constantly changing, which could detrimentally affect our proposed operations. Local, state and federal medical marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter its business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on its operations. It is also possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our business. These ever-changing regulations could even affect federal tax policies that may make it difficult to claim tax deductions on our returns. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on its business.
Since the use of marijuana is illegal under federal law, most banks will not accept, for deposit, funds from businesses involved with marijuana. Consequently, businesses involved in the marijuana industry often have trouble finding a bank willing to accept their business. The inability to open bank accounts may make it difficult for us to operate.
