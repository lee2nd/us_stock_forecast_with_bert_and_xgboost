ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS
Corporate Information
We were incorporated on July 12, 2010 under the laws of the State of Nevada. We were never able to raise sufficient capital to engage in the business of providing web-based services to connect employers in and individuals seeking employment in the UK and Ireland. On February 26, 2013 our two founding officers and directors resigned and were replaced by Warwick Calasse who assumed the title of President, CEO, CFO, Secretary, Treasurer and sole member of our Board of Directors. We disclosed that on January 1, 2013 that we had entered into an Assignment Agreement with dated January 21, 2013 between Golden Glory Panama, as assignee, and Sertesaz Ltd. and C&ENER SA, the Colombian owners that owned 60% and 40% of the concession in return for shares of our common stock and cash payments through March 7, 2016 of over $3,000.000 comprised of payments for the option to purchase 100% of the mining concessions and mining development expenditures.
Our last financial report was a Form 10-Q filed February 20, 2013 for the quarter ended December 31, 2012.
On June 29, 2016, we filed a Form 15 with the Securities Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) to voluntarily effect the deregistration of our common stock. We were eligible to deregister by filing a Form 15 because we had fewer than 300 holders of record of our common stock. Upon the filing of a Form 15, our obligation to file certain reports with the SEC, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, were immediately suspended.
On May 26, 2021, George Sharp was appointed as our Custodian by Order Granting Motion to (1) Intervene, (2) Remove Custodian, (3) Appoint George Sharp as Custodian, and (4) for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction on Order Shortening Time, Case No A-20-815182-B, Dept. No. XVI issued by the District Court of the State of Nevada in and for Clark County (the “Court Order”). Under his authority as Custodian, George Sharp appointed himself as the sole member of the Board and President, Secretary and Treasurer of the Company by resolutions of the registrant’s Board of Directors on May 26, 2021.
There have been no common or preferred stock transactions since 2013 until August 29, 2021 when the Company issued 300,000 shares of the authorized “blank check” preferred stock to George Sharp with 30,000 common votes for each share of preferred stock.
On January 19, 2022, the Company registered with the Secretary of State in Nevada to change their name to Worldwide NFT Inc. FINRA approved the name change, and a forward 3 for 1 stock split of the common shares on June 29, 2022. All common shares have been restated retroactively in accordance with SAB Topic 4C.
On October 22, 2021, the Company issued 3,000,000 common shares and 4,700,000 Series A Preferred shares to the CEO for services valued at $19,880,000.
The preferred shares convert to common at a ratio of 1 share of preferred stock converting to 90 shares of common stock.
All shares were measured pursuant to ASC 718-10-50 using the value of the share price on the date of issuance.
On November 23, 2021, our Form 10 became effective, and the Company became a reporting company.
The Company is in process of identifying potential acquisition targets. There have been no definitive agreements executed as of the date of this report.
Our principal executive offices are located at 3535 Executive Terminal Drive, Henderson, NV 89052, and our telephone number is (702)-840-4433.
The Company’s accounting year end is June 30.
Our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. We will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business or be acquired should such a reasonable opportunity arise.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes. These estimates and assumptions have a significant impact on our financial statements. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
Critical accounting policies are those that require the most subjective and complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. However, we do not believe that there are any alternative methods of accounting for our operations that would have a material effect on our financial statements.
Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act
The COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on the Company, particularly due to our lack of operations. The pandemic may, however, have an impact on our ability to develop business. For example, our efforts will be threatened by government shutdowns, supply and labor issues and resulting economic downturns which the pandemic has historically caused. While vaccinations beginning in 2021 allowed for the partial reopening of the economy, the recent “Omicron” variant of the virus, as well as reduced efficacy of vaccines over time and the possibility that a large number of people decline to get vaccinated or receive booster shots, creates inherent uncertainty as to the future of our business, the industries in which we operate and plan to operate and the economy in general in light of the pandemic.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of the date of this Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
Going Concern
The independent registered public accounting firm auditors’ report accompanying our June 30, 2022 financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared “assuming that we will continue as a going concern,” which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.
Results of Operations
We expect that our operating revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses will greatly increase in the next fiscal year when we identify a potential acquisition target. Currently we only have nominal operating expenses to run the company and report to the Securities and Exchange Commission. We have identified ourselves as a shell company until such time a suitable business can be acquired, and we sustain operations.
For the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021
In the year ended June 30, 2022, we incurred professional fees of $20,060,882, of which $19,930,300 was the result of the valuation of the preferred and common shares issued to the CEO in August and October 2021.This is a non-cash expense. The remaining operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2022 were $130,582 which mostly relate to the filing of the required Securities and Exchange reports as well as costs to bring current the Company with required state regulatory filings.
We had no operating expenses for the comparative period in 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company in May 2021 was recently revived by the State of Nevada. The Company had no operations for a period of five years prior to that when they filed a Form 15.
On May 26, 2021, George Sharp was appointed as our Custodian by Order Granting Motion to (1) Intervene, (2) Remove Custodian, (3) Appoint George Sharp as Custodian, and (4) for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction on Order Shortening Time, Case No A-20-815182-B, Dept. No. XVI issued by the District Court of the State of Nevada in and for Clark County (the “Court Order”). Under his authority as Custodian, George Sharp appointed himself as the sole member of the Board and President, Secretary and Treasurer of the Company by resolutions of the registrant’s Board of Directors on May 26, 2021.
Since May 26, 2021, the Company has completed Securities and Exchange Commission filings to become a fully reporting company. They have brought current state regulatory filings to be compliant in the State of Nevada. The Company has commenced the process to identify suitable acquisition targets. The current operating expenses incurred have been to get to this point. Future operating expenses will be largely funded by George Sharp until such time as the Company can raise the necessary funding to acquire a business and provide necessary working capital to pay for the operating expenses of the Company.
As of June 30, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $20,844,212 and a working capital deficit of $177,162. Our independent registered public accounting firm has provided a going concern opinion on our most recent audited financial statements as of June 30, 2022.
In the future, we will need to consummate one or more capital raising transactions, including potential debt or equity issuances, and/or generate material revenue from an acquired business or businesses to fund our operations. We may also issue shares of common stock, stock options or other securities to compensate our employees or independent contractors.
Net Cash used by Operating Activities:
We reported negative cash flow from operations related to our continuing operations for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 in the amount of $(50,000) and $0, respectively. It is anticipated that we will continue to report negative operating cash flow in future periods. For 2022, the net loss of $(20,068,332) was mostly offset by the non-cash charge of $19,930,300 for the issuance of preferred and common shares in August and October 2021.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities:
We had no investing activities for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities:
For the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the only cash flows from financing activities related to the proceeds from the CEO related to the purchase of preferred shares. There were no financing activities in the year ended June 30, 2021.
Based upon our current operations, we will need additional working capital to fund our operations over the next 12 months. Further, if we are able to close a reverse merger, asset purchase or similar transaction to acquire an operating business, it is likely we will need additional capital, including potentially as a condition of closing the acquisition. Because of the inherent uncertainties of the Company at this stage, we cannot be certain as to how much capital we need, if and how we can raise capital or the type or quantity of securities we will be required to issue to do so. In connection with a business combination, we may issue a significant number our shares of our common stock or securities convertible or exercisable into our common stock to the target’s shareholders which will be dilutive to our shareholders.
We anticipate that we will incur operating losses during the next 12 months. Our ability to develop and implement our business plan will be subject to a number of risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development. Such risks for us include, but are not limited to, an evolving and unpredictable business model; recognition of revenue sources; and the management of growth.
