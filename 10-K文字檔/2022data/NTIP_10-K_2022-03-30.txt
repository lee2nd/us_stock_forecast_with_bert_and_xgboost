ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in the “Risk Factors” Section on pages 11-20 hereof.
OVERVIEW
Our principal business is the development, licensing and protection of our intellectual property assets. We presently own ninety-five (95) patents including: (i) our Cox Patent Portfolio relating to enabling technology for identifying media content on the Internet and taking further action to be performed after such identification; (ii) our M2M/IoT Patent Portfolio relating to, among other things, enabling technology for authenticating, provisioning and using embedded sim cards in next generation IoT, Machine-to-Machine, and other mobile devices, including smartphones, tablets and computers; (iii) our HFT Patent Portfolio covering certain advanced technologies relating to high frequency trading, which inventions specifically address technological problems associated with speed and latency and provide critical latency gains in trading systems where the difference between success and failure may be measured in nanoseconds; (iv) our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio relating to foundational technologies that enable unified search and indexing, displaying and archiving of documents in a computer system; and (v) our Remote Power Patent covering the delivery of power over Ethernet (PoE) cables for the purpose of remotely powering network devices, such as wireless access ports, IP phones and network based cameras. In addition, we continually review opportunities to acquire or license additional intellectual property as well as other strategic alternatives.
During the period December 2018 through March 2021, we made an aggregate investment of $6,000,000 in ILiAD, a clinical stage biotechnology company with an exclusive license to fifty-eight (58) patents (see Note H to our consolidated financial statements included herein). Our investment in ILiAD involves significant risk (see “Risk Factors” at page 15 hereof).
Until March 7, 2020, when our Remote Power Patent expired, we had been actively engaged in the licensing of our Remote Power Patent (U.S. Patent No. 6,218,930) which generated licensing revenue in excess of $187,000,000 from May 2007 through December 31, 2021. As a result of the expiration of our Remote Power Patent, we no longer receive licensing revenue for our Remote Power Patent for any period subsequent to the expiration date (March 7, 2020). However, subsequent to the expiration date of our Remote Power Patent, we received licensing revenue from certain licensees for periods prior to March 7, 2020 as referenced below.
On March 30, 2021, we entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Settlement and License Agreement, dated May 25, 2011, between us and Cisco (the “Agreement”). Pursuant to the Amendment, Cisco agreed to pay $18,692,000 to us to resolve a dispute relating to Cisco’s contractual obligation to pay us royalties under the Agreement for the period beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017 through March 7, 2020 (when the Remote Power Patent expired) with respect to licensing the Remote Power Patent (see Note K[2] to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report).
On July 26, 2021, we entered into a settlement agreement with Hewlett-Packard pursuant to which Hewlett-Packard paid us $17,000,000 in full settlement of a patent litigation involving our Remote Power Patent (see Note K[1] to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). We believe that Netgear, another licensee of our Remote Power Patent, is obligated to pay us royalties that accrued but were not paid since the fourth quarter of 2017 through March 7, 2020. In December 2020, we commenced litigation against Netgear for such unpaid royalties (see Note K[5] to our consolidated financial statements included herein).
Our current strategy includes continuing our licensing efforts with respect to our intellectual property assets and the monetization of our patent portfolios. In addition, we continue to seek to acquire additional intellectual property assets to develop, commercialize, license or otherwise monetize. Our strategy includes working with inventors and patent owners to assist in the development and monetization of their patented technologies. We may also enter into strategic relationships with third parties to develop, commercialize, license or otherwise monetize their intellectual property. Our patent acquisition and development strategy is to focus on acquiring high quality patents which management believes have the potential to generate significant licensing opportunities as we have achieved with respect to our Remote Power Patent and Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio.
On March 25, 2022, we completed the acquisition of a new patent portfolio (the HFT Patent Portfolio) consisting of six U.S. patents and two pending U.S. patents (see Note P[5] to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report).
Our future operating results may be materially impacted by our ability to acquire high quality patents which management believes have the potential to generate significant licensing opportunities. In the future, we may not be able to identify or consummate such patent acquisitions or achieve significant licensing revenue with respect to such patent acquisitions.
We have been dependent upon our Remote Power Patent for a significant portion of our revenue. Our Remote Power Patent has generated licensing revenue in excess of $187,000,000 from May 2007 through December 31, 2021. Revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 of $36,029,000, 2020 of $4,403,000 and 2019 of $3,037,000 from license agreements for our Remote Power Patent constituted 100% of our revenue. As a result of the expiration of our Remote Power Patent on March 7, 2020, we no longer receive licensing revenue for our Remote Power Patent for any period subsequent to the expiration date. Except for our pending litigation against Netgear involving our Remote Power Patent, our future revenue will be entirely dependent on our ability to monetize our Cox, M2M/IoT, HFT and Mirror Worlds patent portfolios as well as any new patents we may acquire.
Our operating results for 2021 included revenue of $36,029,000 and net income of $14,281,000 which was primarily the result of the resolution of our contractual dispute with Cisco in which we received $18,692,000 and our litigation settlement of $17,000,000 with Hewlett-Packard. While we have pending litigation involving certain patents within our Cox Patent Portfolio against Google and YouTube and intend to appeal the judgment of the District Court dismissing our litigation against Facebook on the grounds of non-infringement involving certain patents within our Mirror Worlds Portfolio, we may not achieve successful outcomes of the litigation or the appeal. Accordingly, our operating results for 2021 may not be indicative of operating results in 2022 or future years.
The significant components of expenses impacting our net income include contingent legal fees and expenses related to our patent litigation (see Note B[8] to our consolidated financial statements included herein) and incentive compensation payable to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer pursuant to his employment agreement (see Note J[1] to our consolidated financial statements included herein), both such components of expenses are based on a percentage of the licensing revenue received by us as a result of litigation or otherwise.
Our annual and quarterly operating and financial results may fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of a variety of factors that are outside our control, including the timing and our ability to achieve successful outcomes of patent litigation, our ability and timing of consummating future license agreements for our intellectual property, and whether we will achieve a return on our investment in ILiAD Biotechnologies, LLC (“ILiAD”) and the timing of any such distributions.
At December 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $59,623,000 and working capital of $55,665,000. Based on our current cash position, we believe that we will have sufficient cash to fund our operations for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future. Based on our cash position, we continually review opportunities to acquire additional intellectual property as well as evaluate other strategic opportunities.
In future years we could be classified as a Personal Holding Company. If this is the case, we would be subject to a 20% tax on the amount of any PHC Income (as defined) for such year that we do not distribute to our shareholders (see Note E to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report).
As to the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on us, COVID-19 has and continues to cause some delays in the courts including the scheduling of trial dates, which could adversely affect the timing of our consummation of future license agreements (see “Risk Factors - The global COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse impact on our Business”) at page 16 hereof.
On June 9, 2021, our Board of Directors approved the continuation of our dividend policy consisting of semi-annual cash dividends of $0.05 per share ($0.10 per share annually) which are anticipated to be paid in March and September of each year. In 2021, we paid semi-annual cash dividends in accordance with our dividend policy. Our dividend policy undergoes a periodic review by our Board of Directors and is subject to change at any time depending upon our financial requirements, earnings and other factors existing at the time (see Note O to our consolidated financial statements included herein).
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020
Revenue. We had revenue of $36,029,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 (“2021”) as compared to revenue of $4,403,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 (“2020”). The increase in revenue of $31,626,000 for 2021 was primarily due to revenue of $18,692,000 from our resolution of a contractual dispute with Cisco concerning licensing of our Remote Power Patent and revenue of $17,000,000 from our litigation settlement with Hewlett-Packard (see Notes K[1] and K[2] to our consolidated financial statements included herein).
Operating Expenses. Operating expenses for 2021 were $16,443,000 as compared to $6,816,000 for 2020. The increase in operating expenses for 2021 was primarily due to an increase in costs of revenue of $10,494,000 as a result of revenue of $18,692,000 from resolution of our contractual dispute with Cisco concerning licensing of our Remote Power Patent and revenue of $17,000,000 from our litigation settlement with Hewlett-Packard (see Notes K[1] and K[2] to our consolidated financial statements included herein). We had costs of revenue of $12,147,000 and $1,653,000 for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Included in the costs of revenue for 2021 were contingent legal fees
of $10,346,000 and $1,801,000 of incentive bonus compensation payable to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer pursuant to his employment agreement (see Note J[1] to our consolidated financial statements included herein). Included in the costs of revenue for 2020 were contingent legal fees of $1,433,000 and $220,000 of incentive bonus compensation payable to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer pursuant to his employment agreement.
Professional fees and related costs decreased by $907,000 for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily as a result of decreased expenses related to patent litigation.
Operating Income (Loss). We had operating income of $19,586,000 for 2021 compared with an operating loss of $2,413,000 for 2020. The increase in operating income of $21,999,000 for 2021 was primarily due to our increase in revenue of $31,626,000 for 2021 from the resolution of our contractual dispute with Cisco and our litigation settlement with Hewlett-Packard.
Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income for 2021 was $327,000 as compared to interest and dividend income of $522,000 for 2020 which decrease was primarily as a result of a change in the mix of our short-term fixed income investments and cash equivalents.
Income Taxes. In 2021, we had a current tax expense for federal, state and local income taxes of $2,952,000 and a deferred tax expense of $1,508,000. In 2020, we had a deferred tax benefit for federal, state and local income taxes of $490,000 related to the relief of our valuation allowance and a current tax benefit of $464,000 in connection with prior year losses. The difference between 2021 and 2020 was primarily as a result of an increase in operating income for 2021 of $21,999,000.
Share of Net Losses of Equity Method Investee. We incurred a net loss of $999,000 for 2021 related to our equity share in ILiAD Biotechnologies, a clinical stage biotechnology company, as compared to a net loss of $787,000 for 2020 as ILiAD Biotechnologies has no revenue from operations and continues to sustain losses (see Note H to our consolidated financial statements included herein).
Net Income (Loss). As a result of the foregoing, we realized a net income of $14,281,000 or $0.59 per share basic and $0.58 diluted for 2021 compared with a net loss of $1,709,000 or $(0.07) per share basic and diluted for 2020. The increase in net income of $15,990,000 during 2021 was primarily due to income associated with our increased revenue of $36,029,000 from the resolution of our contractual dispute with Cisco and our litigation settlement with Hewlett-Packard (see Notes K[1] and K[2] to our consolidated financial statements included herein).
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We have financed our operations primarily from revenue from licensing our patents. At December 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $59,623,000 and working capital of $55,665,000. Based on our current cash position, we believe that we will have sufficient cash to fund our operations for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future. Material increases in our liquidity and capital resources are primarily dependent upon litigation outcomes and licensing of our intellectual property as well as whether we will be able to achieve returns on our investment in ILiAD Biotechnologies.
Working capital increased by $12,706,000 at December 31, 2021 to $55,665,000 as compared to working capital of $42,959,000 at December 31, 2020. The increase in working capital of $12,706,000 for 2021 was primarily due to net income of $14,281,000 during 2021.
Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for 2021 increased by $20,002,000 from $(503,000) for 2020 to $19,499,000 for 2021 primarily due to revenue of $36,029,000 from resolution of our contractual dispute with Cisco and our litigation settlement with Hewlett-Packard during 2021.
Net cash provided by investing activities during 2021 was $2,994,000 as compared to $6,306,000 for 2020 primarily as a result of the differential of purchases and sales of marketable securities and partially offset by our $1,000,000 convertible note investment in ILiAD Biotechnologies (see Note H to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report).
Net cash used in financing activities for 2021 and 2020 was $3,501,000 and $2,885,000, respectively. The change of $616,000 primarily resulted from an increase of $824,000 in repurchases of our common stock offset by a decrease of $147,000 in the value of shares delivered to fund withholding taxes and a decrease of $61,000 in cash dividends paid.
We maintain our cash in money market funds and short-term fixed income securities. Accordingly, we do not believe that our investments have significant exposure to interest rate risk.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, purchase obligations, operating lease obligations, or other long-term liabilities.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are based on our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The significant estimates and assumptions made in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition, contingent legal fees and related expenses, income taxes, valuation of patents and equity method investments. Actual results could be materially different from those estimates, upon which the carrying values were based. See also Note B to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for full disclosure of our accounting policies.
We believe our most critical accounting policies to be the following:
Revenue Recognition
Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized when we complete the licensing of our intellectual property to our licensees, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for licensing our intellectual property. Revenue from our patent licensing business is generated from negotiated license agreements. The timing and amount of revenue recognized from each licensee depends upon a variety of factors, including the terms of each agreement and the nature of the obligations of the parties. These agreements may include, but not be limited to, elements related to past infringement liabilities, non-refundable upfront license fees, and ongoing royalties on licensed products sold by the licensee. Generally, in the event of settlement of litigation related to our assertion of patent infringement involving our intellectual property, defendants will either pay (i) a non-refundable lump sum payment for a non-exclusive fully-paid license (a “Fully-Paid License”), or (ii) a non-refundable lump sum payment (license initiation fee) together with an ongoing obligation to pay quarterly or monthly royalties to us for the life of the licensed patent (a “Royalty Bearing License”).
We recognize revenue from our Royalty Bearing Licenses in a manner consistent with the legal form of the arrangement, and in accordance with the royalty recognition constraint that applies to licenses of IP for which some or all of the consideration is in the form of sales or usage based royalty. Consequently, we recognize revenue at the later of when (1) the subsequent sale occurs or (2) the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales based royalty has been satisfied.
Fully-Paid Licenses provide for a non-refundable up-front payment, for which we have no future obligations or performance requirements, revenue is generally recognized when we have obtained the signed license agreement, all performance obligations have been substantially performed, amounts are fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue from Fully-Paid Licenses may consist of one or more installments. The timing and amount of revenue recognized from each licensee depends upon a number of factors including the specific terms of each agreement and the nature of the deliverables and obligations.
Costs of Revenue and Related Costs
We include in costs of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 contingent legal fees payable to patent litigation counsel, any other contractual payments related to net proceeds from settlements (see Note I[1] hereof) and incentive bonus compensation payable to its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
