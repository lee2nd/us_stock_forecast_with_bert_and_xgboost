Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in thousands)
The following discussion provides information about the major components of the results of operations and financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of F & M Bank Corp. and its subsidiaries. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Information, of this Form 10-K.
Lending Activities
Credit Policies
The principal risk associated with each of the segments of loans in our portfolio is the creditworthiness of our borrowers. Within each segment, such risk is increased or decreased, depending on prevailing economic conditions. In an effort to manage the risk, our loan policy gives loan amount approval limits to individual loan officers based on their position and level of experience and to our loan committees based on the size of the lending relationship. The risk associated with real estate and construction loans, commercial loans and consumer loans varies, based on market employment levels, fluctuations in the value of real estate and other conditions that affect the ability of borrowers to repay indebtedness. The risk associated with real estate construction loans varies, based on the supply and demand for the type of real estate under construction.
We have written policies and procedures to help manage credit risk. We have a loan review policy that includes regular portfolio reviews to establish loss exposure and to ascertain compliance with our loan policy.
We use a management loan committee and a directors’ loan committee to approve loans. The management loan committee is comprised of members of senior management, credit administration and senior lenders; the directors’ loan committee is comprised of any six directors. Both committees approve new, renewed and or modified loans that exceed officer loan authorities. The directors’ loan committee also reviews any changes to our lending policies, which are then approved by our board of directors.
Construction and Development Lending
We make construction loans, primarily residential, and land acquisition and development loans. The residential construction loans are secured by residential houses under construction and the underlying land for which the loan was obtained. The land acquisition and development loans are secured by the land for which the loan was obtained. The average life of a construction loan is approximately 12 months, and it is typically re-priced as the prime rate of interest changes. Construction lending entails significant additional risks, compared with residential mortgage lending. Construction loans often involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Another risk involved in construction lending is attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of the land or home under construction, which value is estimated prior to the completion of construction. Thus, it is more difficult to evaluate accurately the total loan funds required to complete a project and related loan-to-value ratios. To mitigate the risks associated with construction lending, we generally limit loan amounts to 75% to 90% of appraised value, in addition to analyzing the creditworthiness of our borrowers. We also obtain a first lien on the property as security for our construction loans and typically require personal guarantees from the borrower’s principal owners.
Commercial Real Estate Lending
Commercial real estate loans are secured by various types of commercial real estate in our market area, including multi-family residential buildings, commercial buildings and offices, shopping centers and churches. Commercial real estate lending entails significant additional risks, compared with residential mortgage lending. Commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Additionally, the payment experience on loans secured by income producing properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of a business or a real estate project and thus may be subject, to a greater extent, to adverse conditions in the real estate market or in the economy in general. Our commercial real estate loan underwriting criteria require an examination of debt service coverage ratios and the borrower’s creditworthiness, prior credit history and reputation. We also evaluate the location of the property securing the loan and typically require personal guarantees or endorsements of the borrower’s principal owners.

Commercial & Industry - Non-Real Estate
Business loans generally have a higher degree of risk than residential mortgage loans but have higher yields. To manage these risks, we generally obtain appropriate collateral and personal guarantees from the borrower’s principal owners and monitor the financial condition of our business borrowers. Residential mortgage loans generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from employment and other income and are secured by real estate whose value tends to be readily ascertainable. In contrast, business loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from cash flow from its business and are secured by business assets, such as real estate, accounts receivable, equipment and inventory. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of business loans is substantially dependent on the success of the business itself. Furthermore, the collateral for business loans may depreciate over time and generally cannot be appraised with as much precision as residential real estate.
Consumer Lending
We offer various consumer loans, including personal loans, automobile loans, deposit account loans, installment and demand loans, and home equity loans. We currently originate all of our consumer loans in our geographic market area.
The underwriting standards employed by us for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant’s payment history on other debts and an assessment of their ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. The stability of the applicant’s monthly income may be determined by verification of gross monthly income from primary employment and additionally from any verifiable secondary income. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes an analysis of the value of the security in relation to the proposed loan amount. For home equity lines of credit and loans we require title insurance, hazard insurance and, if required, flood insurance.
Residential Mortgage Lending
The Bank makes residential mortgage loans for the purchase or refinance of existing loans with loan to value limits generally ranging between 80 and 90% depending on the age of the property, borrower’s income and credit worthiness. Loans that are retained in our portfolio generally carry adjustable rates that can change every one, three or five years, based on amortization periods of twenty to thirty years.
Loans Held for Sale
The Bank makes fixed rate mortgage loans with terms of typically fifteen or thirty years through its subsidiary F&M Mortgage. These loans are funded by F&M Mortgage utilizing a line of credit at the Bank until sold to investors in the secondary market. Similarly, the Bank also has a relationship with Northpointe Bank in Grand Rapids, MI whereby it can purchase fixed rate conforming 1-4 family mortgage loans for short periods of time pending those loans being sold to investors in the secondary market. These loans have an average duration of ten days to two weeks, but occasionally remain on the Bank’s books for up to 60 days. The Bank began its relationship with Northpointe Bank in 2014 and had a similar program with a prior bank since 2003. F&M Bank does not share in the gains on sale of loans for the Northpointe participation and only earns interest during the holding period.
Dealer Finance Division
In September 2012, the Bank started a loan production office in Penn Laird, VA which specializes in providing automobile financing through a network of automobile dealers. The Dealer Finance Division is staffed with officers that have extensive experience in Dealer Finance. This office is serving the automobile finance needs for customers of dealers throughout the existing geographic footprint of the Bank. Approximately eighty dealers have signed contracts to originate loans on behalf of the Bank. As of year-end 2021, the division had total loans outstanding of $107,346.

Critical Accounting Policies
General
The Company’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The financial information contained within the statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. The Company’s financial position and results of operations are affected by management’s application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the Company’s consolidated financial position and/or results of operations.
In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method. Although the economics of these transactions would be the same, the timing of events that would impact these transactions could change. Following is a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and judgments.
Allowance for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting: (i) ASC 450 “Contingencies”, which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and (ii) ASC 310, “Receivables”, which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral, present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance. The Company’s allowance for loan losses is the accumulation of various components that are calculated based on independent methodologies. All components of the allowance represent an estimation performed pursuant to either ASC 450 or ASC 310. Management’s estimate of each ASC 450 component is based on certain observable data that management believes are most reflective of the underlying credit losses being estimated. This evaluation includes credit quality trends; collateral values; loan volumes; economic conditions, borrower and industry concentrations; changes in the experience and depths of lending management and staff; effects of any concentrations of credit; the findings of internal credit quality assessments, results from external bank regulatory examinations and third-party loan reviews. These factors, as well as historical losses and current economic and business conditions, are used in developing estimated loss factors used in the calculations.
Allowances for loan losses are determined by applying estimated loss factors to the portfolio based on management’s evaluation and “risk grading” of the loan portfolio. Specific allowances, if required, are typically provided on all impaired loans in excess of a defined loan size threshold that are classified in the Substandard or Doubtful risk grades and on all troubled debt restructurings. The specific reserves are determined on a loan-by-loan basis based on management’s evaluation of the Company’s exposure for each credit, given the current payment status of the loan, the value of any underlying collateral or future discounted cash flows.
While management uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan and lease losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions change or, if required by regulators, based upon information available to them at the time of their examinations. Such adjustments to original estimates, as necessary, are made in the period in which these factors and other relevant considerations indicate that loss levels may vary from previous estimates.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in thousands), continued
Fair Value
The estimate of fair value involves the use of (1) quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets, (2) quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques using significant assumptions that are observable in the market or (3) model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. When observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management’s judgment is necessary to arrive at fair value including estimates of current market participant expectations of future cash flows, risk premiums, among other things. Additionally, significant judgment may be required to determine whether certain assets measured at fair value are classified within the fair value hierarchy as Level 2 or Level 3. The estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved result in this item being identified as critical.
Pension Obligations
The accounting guidance for the measurement and recognition of obligations and expense related to pension plans generally applies the concept that the cost of benefits provided during retirement should be recognized over the employees’ active working life. Inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date. Major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of benefits expense and accumulated benefit obligation include discount rates, expected return on assets, mortality rates, and projected salary increases, among others. Changes in assumptions or judgments related to any of these variables could result in significant volatility in the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. As a result, accounting for the Company’s pension expense and obligation is considered a significant estimate. The estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved result in this item being identified as critical.
COVID-19
The World Health Organization declared a global pandemic in the first quarter of 2020 due to the spread of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) around the globe. As a result, the state of Virginia issued a stay at home order in March 2020 requiring all nonessential businesses to shut down and nonessential workers to stay home. The Company, while considered an essential business, implemented procedures to protect its employees, customers and the community and still serve their banking needs. Branch lobbies were closed until April 12, 2021. During this time the Company utilized drive through windows and courier service to handle transactions, new accounts were opened electronically with limited in person contact for document signing and verification of identification, and lenders accepted applications by appointment with limited in person contact as well. Due to high transmission rates in our service area, branch lobbies were closed again from January 18, 2022 to March 7, 2022, and only open by appointment. The Company serviced customers in similar methods as when the lobbies closed in 2020.
The SBA implemented the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) to support small business operations with loans during the shutdown and into the following months. The Company worked diligently to support both our customers and noncustomers within our footprint with these loans. The Company originated a total of 1,080 PPP loans totaling $87,061 and associated fees of $3,824 through the SBA program. The fees will be recognized over the life of the associated loans. As of February 4, 2022, there are 50 loans outstanding with a balance of $4,767 and unamortized fees of $122.
The full impact of COVID-19 and its length of duration remains uncertain at this time. The Company is closely monitoring the effects of the pandemic on our customers. Management assessed the risks in our loan portfolio and worked with our customers to minimize losses.
The company granted 1,266 modifications allowing principal and interest deferrals in connection with the COVID-19 related needs from first quarter 2020 to first quarter 2021. These modifications, 75% of which were short-term dealer loan modifications, were consistent with regulatory guidance and/or the CARES Act. As of January 18, 2022, no loans remain in deferral.

COVID-19, continued
Based on the Company’s capital levels, current underwriting policies, low loan-to-deposit ratio, loan concentration diversification and rural operating environment, management believes that it is well positioned to support its customers and communities and to manage the economic risks and uncertainties associated with COVID-19 pandemic and remain adequately capitalized.
Given the rapidly changing and unprecedented nature of the pandemic, however, the Company could experience material and adverse effects on its business, including as a result of credit deterioration, operational disruptions, decreased demand for products and services, or other reasons. The extent to which the pandemic impacts the Company will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, its duration and severity, the actions to contain it or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions will resume.

Overview
The Company’s net income for 2021 totaled $10,738 or $3.25 per common share (basic), an increase of 22.19% from $8,788 or $2.66 a share (basic) in 2020. Return on average equity increased in 2021 to 10.84% versus 9.46% in 2020, and the return on average assets increased from .95% in 2020 to .98% in 2021. The Company’s net income per share (dilutive) totaled $3.12 in 2021, an increase from $2.56 in 2020.
Changes in Net Income per Common Share (Basic)
Net Interest Income
The largest source of operating revenue for the Company is net interest income, which is calculated as the difference between the interest earned on earning assets and the interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest income increased 0.68% from 2020 to 2021 following a decrease of 1.04% from 2019 to 2020. The net interest margin is the net interest income expressed as a percentage of interest earning assets. Changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, along with their yields and rates, have a significant impact on the level of net interest income. Tax equivalent net interest income for 2021 was $31,385 representing an increase of $231 or 0.74% over the prior year. A 0.99% decrease in 2020 versus 2019 resulted in total tax equivalent net interest income of $31,154.
In this discussion and in the tabular analysis of net interest income performance, entitled “Consolidated Average Balances, Yields and Rates,” the interest earned on tax exempt loans and investment securities has been adjusted to reflect the amount that would have been earned had these investments been subject to normal income taxation. This is referred to as tax equivalent net interest income. For a reconciliation of tax equivalent net interest income to GAAP measures, see the accompanying table.
Tax equivalent income on earning assets decreased $1,196 in 2021 compared to 2020. Loans held for investment, expressed as a percentage of total earning assets, decreased in 2021 to 63.77% as compared to 76.37% in 2020. During 2021, yields on earning assets decreased 86 basis points (BP) and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 34BP. Both are a result of the declining interest rate environment experienced in 2021.

Net Interest Income, continued
The following table provides detail on the components of tax equivalent net interest income:
Interest Income
Tax equivalent net interest income increased $230 or 0.73% in 2021, after decreasing 0.99% or $312 in 2020. Overall, the yield on earning assets decreased 0.86%, from 4.27% to 3.41%. Average loans held for investment increased during 2021, with average loans outstanding increasing $7,973 to $667,082. Average real estate loans decreased 4.20%, commercial loans increased 3.26%, and consumer installment loans increased 12.29% on average. Average investment securities increased 288.46%, with average securities outstanding increasing $175,455 to $236,280.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased $1,426 or 24.90% during 2021. The average cost of funds of 0.60% decreased 34BP compared to 2020, which followed a decrease of 36BP in 2020. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $105,694 or 17.31% in 2021. Interest expense on deposits decreased 27.74%, in spite of a 28.17% increase in average deposits. Interest expense on borrowings decreased 13.21% as average debt decreased 61.21%. Changes in the cost of funds attributable to rate and volume variances are reflected in a following table.
The following analysis reveals a decrease in the net interest margin to 3.00% in 2021 from 3.61% in 2020, due to changes in balance sheet mix during the year and decreases in interest rates in earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The investment portfolio has grown significantly due to the increase in deposits and a decrease in funding loans held for sale with Northpointe Bank. The rate environment remained low in 2021 due to uncertainties in the economy.

The following table illustrates the effect of changes in volumes and rates.
Note: Volume changes have been determined by multiplying the prior years’ average rate by the change in average balances outstanding. The rate change is determined by multiplying the current year average balance outstanding by the change in rate from the prior year to the current year.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income continues to be an increasingly important factor for the Company in maintaining and growing profitability. Management is conscious of the need to constantly review fee income and develop additional sources of complementary revenue.
Noninterest income decreased 7.40% or $904, in 2021. The 2021 decrease is due primarily to a decline in the gross revenue of F&M Mortgage and realized security losses. The decline in revenue from F&M Mortgage was due to a decrease in refinance volume. The Company experienced growth in investment services and insurance income, title insurance income and ATM and check card fees.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in thousands), Continued
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expenses increased from $29,939 in 2020 to $33,340 in 2021, an 11.36% increase. Expenses increased primarily in the areas of salaries and benefits ($2,003), legal and professional expense ($406), telecommunication and data processing expense ($406), and other operating expenses ($376). Salary increases were due to expansion into the Winchester and Waynesboro markets; this also increased legal and professional fees and data processing expenses. Other operating expenses include loss on the sale of bank property ($112), donation of bank property ($162) and prepayment penalties on FHLB debt repayments ($228). Total noninterest expense as a percentage of average assets totaled 3.05% and 3.36% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Peer group averages (as reported in the most recent Uniform Bank Performance Report) were 2.40% for 2021 and 2.60% for 2020.
Provision for Loan Losses
Management evaluates the loan portfolio in light of national and local economic trends, changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and industry standards. Specific factors considered by management in determining the adequacy of the level of the allowance for loan losses include internally generated and third-party loan review reports, past due reports and historical loan loss experience. This review also considers concentrations of loans in terms of geography, business type and level of risk. Management evaluates nonperforming loans relative to their collateral value, when deemed collateral dependent, and makes the appropriate adjustments to the allowance for loan losses when needed. Due to COVID-19, the Company had added or increased qualitative factors for the economy and concentrations in industries specifically affected by the virus. The Company continues to evaluate these factors in light of the changing effects the virus has on the economy, supply chains, and labor markets. The Company has experienced improvements in past dues and nonperforming loans since December 31, 2020. Past due loans have decreased $4,609 and nonperforming loans have decreased $1,029 since December 31, 2020.
As a result of the above factors, the current year recovery of provision for loan losses totaled $2,821 compared to a provision of $3,300 for 2020. Net charge offs decreased from $1,215 in 2020 to net recoveries of $94 in 2021. Net charge-offs as a percentage of loans held for investment totaled (0.01)% and 0.18% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The dealer finance charge-off percentage is the largest category at 0.04% of loans held for investment. Losses in the dealer finance segment are closely monitored, and due to payment deferrals, government stimulus programs and record high used car prices, have declined in 2021. As stated in the most recently available Uniform Bank Performance Report (UPBR), peer group loss averages were 0.04% in 2021 and 0.08% in 2020.
The current levels of the allowance for loan losses reflect net charge-off activity and other credit risk factors that the Company considers in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Management will continue to monitor the effects of COVID-19 and nonperforming, adversely classified and past due loans to make necessary adjustments to specific reserves and provision for loan losses should conditions change regarding collateral values or cash flow expectations.
Balance Sheet
Total assets increased 26.10% during the year to $1,219,342 at December 31, 2021, an increase of $252,412 from $966,930 at December 31, 2020. Cash and cash equivalents increased $9,713, the AFS security portfolio grew $296,983, net loans held for investment increased $3,819, and loans held for sale declined $53,792. Average earning assets increased 21.21% to $1,046,095 for 2021. The increase in earning assets is due largely to the growth in investment securities and federal funds sold. Deposits grew $261,713 and non-deposit liabilities decreased $14,128 in 2021 as the Bank paid off long-term debt with the FHLB. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $151,092 for 2021 or 28.17%, with increases in interest-bearing demand accounts and savings while time deposits declined. The Company continues to utilize its assets well, with 95.57% of average assets consisting of earning assets.

In January 2021, the Bank entered into an agreement to purchase the operations of a branch office in Waynesboro, Virginia from Carter Bank & Trust. The Bank acquired deposits of $14,229 in the transaction and received a cash payment of $13,758, which was net of a premium paid on deposits of $135. No loans were included in the transaction. The transaction closed on April 23, 2021; see Note 29 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for additional details on the transaction.
Investment Securities
Due to the deposit growth initiatives implemented in recent years and the COVID-19 pandemic, management has invested excess funds into securities during 2021. Total securities increased $295,319 or 250.49% in 2021 to $413,217 at December 31, 2021 from $117,898 at December 31, 2020. Average balances in investment securities increased 288.46% in 2021 to $236,280. At year end, 22.59% of average earning assets of the Company were held as investment securities, all of which are unpledged. Management strives to match the types and maturities of securities owned to balance projected liquidity needs, interest rate sensitivity and to maximize earnings through a portfolio bearing low credit risk. Portfolio yields averaged 1.23% for 2021, compared to 1.73% in 2020; this is due to the overall market declines in 2021.
There were no Other Than Temporary Impairments (OTTI) write-downs in 2021 or 2020. There were $525 in realized security losses on sales of securities in 2021; there were no realized security gains or loss on sales of securities in 2020.
Maturities and weighted average yields of securities at December 31, 2021 are presented in the table below. Amounts are shown by contractual maturity; expected maturities will differ as issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations. Maturities of other investments are not readily determinable due to the nature of the investment; see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of these investments.

The Company’s market area has a relatively stable economy which tends to be less cyclical than the national economy. Major industries in the market area include agricultural production and processing, higher education, retail sales, services and light manufacturing.
The Company’s portfolio of loans held for investment totaled $662,421 at December 31, 2021 compared with $661,329 at December 31, 2020. Collateral required by the Company is determined on an individual basis depending on the purpose of the loan and the financial condition of the borrower. Real estate mortgages decreased $23,466 or 14.39%. Construction loans increased $3,769 or 5.27%. Commercial loans, including agricultural and multifamily loans, increased 4.25% during 2021 to $279,019; PPP loans decreased from $34,908 at December 31, 2020 to $7,936 at December 31, 2021. Consumer loans increased $14,116 or 13.94% mainly due to the dealer finance division loans. Consumer loans include personal loans, auto loans and other loans to individuals.
The following table shows the maturity of loans and leases, outstanding as of December 31, 2021:

Analysis of Loan Portfolio, continued
At December 31, 2021, for loans and leases due after one year, interest rate information is as follows:
Residential real estate loans are made for a period up to 30 years and are secured by a first deed of trust which normally does not exceed 90% of the appraised value. If the loan to value ratio exceeds 90%, the Company requires additional collateral, guarantees or mortgage insurance. On approximately 81% of the real estate loans, interest is adjustable after each one, three or five-year period. The remainder of the portfolio is comprised of fixed rate loans that are generally made for a fifteen-year or a twenty-year period with an interest rate adjustment after ten years, except for dealer loans that generally have a term of 5 years.
Fixed rate real estate loans were partially funded with fixed rate borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank, which allowed the Company to control its interest rate risk. The Company has not had a need for additional funding from the FHLB due to the growth in deposits, but there may be a time where we match the maturities in the future. In addition, the Company makes home equity loans secured by second deeds of trust with total indebtedness not to exceed 90% of the appraised value. Home equity loans are made for ten or twenty year periods as a revolving line of credit.

Construction loans may be made to individuals, who have arranged with a contractor for the construction of a residence, or to contractors that are involved in building pre-sold, spec-homes or subdivisions. The majority of commercial loans are made to small retail, manufacturing and service businesses. Commercial construction loans are made to construct commercial and agricultural buildings. Consumer loans are made for a variety of reasons; however, approximately 75% of the loans are secured by vehicles.
Approximately 75% of the Company’s loans are secured by real estate; however, policies relating to appraisals and loan to value ratios are adequate to control the related risk. Market values continue to be stable with increases in sales prices, reduction in inventory and reduction in days on the market. Unemployment rates in the Company’s market area continue to be below both the national and state averages.
The Bank has not identified any loan categories that would be considered loan concentrations of greater than 25% of capital. The Bank has an approved limit of 16% for dealer loans as a percentage of total loans. The Bank has not developed a formal policy limiting the concentration level of any other particular loan type or industry segment; it has established target limits on both a nominal and percentage of capital basis. Concentrations are monitored and reported to the board of directors quarterly. Concentration levels have been used by management to determine how aggressively we may price or pursue new loan requests.
Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans
Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and loans 90 days or more past due still accruing. Nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest accruals have been suspended or discontinued permanently. The Company would have earned approximately $276 in additional interest income in 2021 had the loans on nonaccrual status been current and performing. Nonperforming loans totaled $5,508 at December 31, 2021 compared to $6,537 at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021, there were $43 of loans 90 days or more past due and accruing compared to $102 at December 31, 2020. The remainder of nonperforming loans were on nonaccrual. Management continues their efforts to reduce nonperforming loans, which decreased 15.74% from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 and from 0.99% of loans held for investment at December 31, 2020 to 0.83% at December 31, 2021.
Approximately 98.48% of these nonperforming loans are secured by real estate and were in the process of collection. The Bank believes that adequate specific reserves have been established on impaired loans and continues to actively work with its customers to effect payment. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company holds $0 of real estate acquired through foreclosure.
A summary of credit ratios for nonaccrual loans is as follows:

Potential Problem Loans
As of December 31, 2021, management is not aware of any potential problem loans which are not already classified for regulatory purposes or on the watch list as part of the Bank’s internal grading system.
Loan Losses and the Allowance for Loan Losses
Management evaluates the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis in light of national and local economic trends, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio and trends in past due and criticized loans. Specific factors evaluated include internally generated loan review reports, past due reports, historical loan loss experience and changes in the financial strength of individual borrowers that have been included on the Bank’s watch list or schedule of classified loans.
In evaluating the portfolio, loans are segregated by segment with identified potential losses, pools of loans by type, with separate weighting for past dues and a general allowance based on a variety of criteria. Loans with identified potential losses include examiner and bank classified loans. Classified relationships in excess of $500,000 and loans identified as troubled debt restructurings are reviewed individually for impairment under ASC 310. A variety of factors are considered when reviewing these credits, including borrower cash flow, payment history, fair value of collateral, company management, industry and economic factors.
Loans that are not reviewed for impairment are categorized by call report code and an estimate is calculated based on actual loss experience over the last three years. As reflected in Note 6, the Company made a change in its allowance for loan losses methodology to increase the look back period on historical losses from two years to three years. This revised lookback period more accurately reflects the average loss history within the portfolio, as loss history during the most recent two years was impacted by government programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
A general allowance for inherent losses has been established to reflect other unidentified losses within the portfolio. The general allowance is calculated using nine qualitative factors identified in the 2006 Interagency Policy Statement on the allowance for loan losses. The general allowance assists in managing recent changes in portfolio risk that may not be captured in individually impaired loans, or in the homogeneous pools based on loss histories. The Board approves the loan loss provision for each quarter based on this evaluation.
The allowance for loan losses of $7,748 at December 31, 2021 is equal to 1.17% of total loans held for investment. This compares to an allowance of $10,475 or 1.58% of total loans at December 31, 2020. PPP loans are 100% guaranteed by the SBA; thus, they do not have an allowance. PPP loans totaled $7,936 and $34,908 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
During 2021, three relationships reviewed for impairment improved their collateral and/or cash flow position and were moved to the general allowance; proceeds were received on one foreclosure sale, sales of collateral to reduce the debt and amortization; and new appraisals on three relationships decreased the calculated impairment. Due to COVID-19, the bank increased the qualitative factor for the economy and concentrations in industries specifically affected by the virus in 2020. Due to improvements in 2021 in the unemployment rate, nonperforming, past due and classified loans, and the end of CARES Act modifications, the bank decreased the environmental factor for COVID-19’s impact on the economy. The Company continues to monitor COVID-19’s effects on the labor market, inflation, the supply chain, government stimulus programs and increased used car prices. Nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2021 totaled $5,465 compared to $6,435 at December 31, 2020. Classified loans (internally rated substandard or watch) decreased from a total of $67,592 at December 31, 2020 to $43,230 at December 31, 2021, or 36%. This remains above the pre-pandemic total of $41,343. Management is closely monitoring the effects of COVID-19 on the loan portfolio and makes adjustments to specific reserves, the environmental factors and the provision for loan losses as necessary.
Loan recoveries, net of losses, totaled $94 in 2021 which is equivalent to (.01)% of total loans outstanding.

ALLOCATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES
Deposits and Borrowings
The average deposit balances and average rates paid for 2021 and 2020 were as follows:
Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits, which are comprised of checking accounts, increased $60,599 or 29.81% from $203,312 at December 31, 2020 to $263,911 at December 31, 2021. Average interest-bearing deposits, which include interest checking accounts, money market accounts, regular savings accounts and time deposits, increased $151,092 or 28.17% from $536,445 at December 31, 2020 to $687,537 at December 31, 2021. Total average interest checking account balances increased $39,047 or 36.17% from $107,961 at December 31, 2020 to $147,008 at December 31, 2021.

Average time deposits decreased $2,321 or 1.76% from $132,081 at December 31, 2020 to $129,760 at December 31, 2021. The money market rate has been attractive and as time deposits matured, customers moved their deposits to the money market account.
The maturity distribution of certificates of deposit in excess of FDIC limits is as follows:
Total uninsured deposits in excess of $250,000 was $323,361 and $179,218 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Non-deposit borrowings include Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings and subordinated debt notes. Non-deposit borrowings are an important source of funding for the Bank that assist in managing short and long-term funding needs.
Borrowings from the FHLB are used to support the Bank’s lending program and allow the Bank to manage interest rate risk by laddering maturities and matching funding terms to the terms of various loan types in the loan portfolio. The Company had no short-term borrowings in 2021 or 2020 due to deposit growth. Repayment of amortizing and fixed maturity loans through FHLB totaled $11,268 during 2021. One loan with a balance of $10,000 and rate of 0.81% was outstanding at December 31, 2021.
Other long-term debt includes $11,772 of subordinated notes, net of unamortized costs at December 31, 2021. On July 29, 2020, the Company issued $5,000 in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% fixed rate subordinated notes due July 31, 2027 and $7,000 in aggregate principal amount of 6% fixed to floating rate subordinated notes due July 31, 2030.

Stockholders’ Equity, continued
Banking regulators have established a uniform system to address the adequacy of capital for financial institutions. The rules require minimum capital levels based on risk-adjusted assets. Simply stated, the riskier an entity’s investments, the more capital it is required to maintain. The Bank is required to maintain these minimum capital levels. Beginning in 2015, the Bank implemented the Basel III capital requirements, which introduced the Common Equity Tier I ratio in addition to the two previous capital guidelines of Tier I capital (referred to as core capital) and Tier II capital (referred to as supplementary capital). At December 31, 2021, the Bank had Common Equity Tier I capital of 13.95%, Tier I risked based capital of 13.95% and total risked based capital of 15.00% of risk weighted assets. Regulatory minimums at this date were 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively. The Bank has maintained capital levels far above the minimum requirements throughout the year. In the unlikely event that such capital levels are not met, regulatory agencies are empowered to require the Bank to raise additional capital and/or reallocate present capital.
In addition, the regulatory agencies have issued guidelines requiring the maintenance of a capital leverage ratio. The leverage ratio is computed by dividing Tier I capital by average total assets. The regulators have established a minimum of 4% for this ratio but can increase the minimum requirement based upon an institution’s overall financial condition. At December 31, 2021, the Bank reported a leverage ratio of 8.62%. The Bank’s leverage ratio was also substantially above the minimum. The Bank also reported a capital conservation buffer of 7.00% at December 31, 2021. The capital conservation buffer is designed to strengthen an institution’s financial resilience during economic cycles. Financial institutions are required to maintain a minimum buffer as required by the Basel III final rules in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and other payments.
Market Risk Management
Most of the Company’s net income is dependent on the Bank’s net interest income. Rapid changes in short-term interest rates may lead to volatility in net interest income resulting in additional interest rate risk to the extent that imbalances exist between the maturities or repricing of interest-bearing liabilities and interest earning assets. The Company’s net interest margin decreased .61% in 2021 following a decrease of .72% in 2020. This decrease is primarily due to decreases in interest rates as well as changes in balance sheet structure including a decrease in loans held for investment, establishing an investment portfolio, and substantial deposit growth which led to excess funds on hand. In 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee elected to decrease the short-term rates target 150BP to 0% from 1.50%.
Net interest income is also affected by changes in the mix of funding that supports earning assets. For example, higher levels of non-interest bearing demand deposits and leveraging earning assets by funding with stockholder’s equity would result in greater levels of net interest income than if most of the earning assets were funded with higher cost interest-bearing liabilities, such as certificates of deposit and borrowings.
Liquid assets, which include cash and cash equivalents, federal funds sold, interest bearing deposits and short-term investments averaged $83,265 for 2021. The Bank historically has had a stable core deposit base and, therefore, does not have to rely on volatile funding sources. Because of growth in the core deposit base, liquid assets have grown over the prior year. The Company has increased efforts to raise deposits and depositors have changed their savings habits during 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While this helps liquidity, the investment options and rate market in general have hurt the net interest margin. The Company has lowered core deposit rates throughout 2021 to mitigate the decline in net interest margin. The Bank’s membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank has historically provided liquidity as the Bank borrows money that is repaid over a five to ten-year period and uses the money to make fixed rate loans. With excess funds provided by deposit growth, management anticipates no additional borrowings in 2022. The matching of the long-term receivables and liabilities helps the Bank reduce its sensitivity to interest rate changes. The Company reviews its interest rate gap periodically and makes adjustments as needed. Management is not aware of any off-balance sheet items that will impair future liquidity.

The following table depicts the Company’s interest rate sensitivity, as measured by the repricing of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2021. As the notes to the table indicate, the data was based in part on assumptions as to when certain assets or liabilities would mature or reprice. The analysis indicates an asset sensitive one-year cumulative GAP position of -1.96% of total earning assets, compared to 17.03% in 2020. Approximately 22.42% of rate sensitive assets and 34.19% of rate sensitive liabilities are subject to repricing within one year. Short term assets (less than one year) decreased $99,862 during the year, while total earning assets increased $256,998. The growth in earning assets is primarily due to the utilization of excess funds created by deposit growth. Short term deposits, maturities less than 365 days, increased $78,658 and short-term borrowings decreased $3,623. Short term borrowings decreased as advances matured and were not renewed.
The following GAP analysis shows the time frames as of December 31, 2021, in which the Company’s assets and liabilities are subject to repricing:
·
In preparing the above table, no assumptions are made with respect to loan prepayments or deposit run off. Loan principal payments are included in the earliest period in which the loan matures or can be repriced. Principal payments on installment loans scheduled prior to maturity are included in the period of maturity or repricing. Proceeds from the redemption of investments and deposits are included in the period of maturity. Estimated maturities on deposits which have no stated maturity dates were derived from regulatory guidance.
