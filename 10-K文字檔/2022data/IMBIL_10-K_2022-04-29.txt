Overview

Results of Operations - iMedia Consolidated
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain statement of operations data.
Consolidated Net Sales
Consolidated net sales during fiscal 2021 were $551,134 compared to $454,171 during fiscal 2020, a 21.3% increase. Consolidated net sales during fiscal 2020 were $454,171 compared to $501,822 during fiscal 2019, a 9.5% decrease. The increase in consolidated net sales in 2021 was primarily due to the incremental net sales from the completed 2021 acquisitions of Christopher & Banks, Synacor, 1-2-3.tv, and TCO, and the improved performance of the entertainment segment. For 2020, the $47,651 or 9.5% decrease in net sales was primarily due to our priority to increase our gross margin by decreasing net sales of merchandise categories with lower gross margin rates, such as consumer electronics.
Gross Margin
Consolidated gross margin percentages were 40.4%, 36.8% and 32.6% for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For 2021, the 361-basis point improvement was primarily attributable to the entertainment segment’s intentional increase in the percentage of sales from merchandise categories with higher margin rates, such as jewelry and watches, fashion and beauty. Our consolidated gross margin percentage was further improved in 2021 due to the impact from the completed 2021 acquisition of Christopher & Banks in the consumer brands segment. The consumer brands segment had a gross margin percentage of 49.5% for 2021 and contributed 9.9% of total gross margin in 2021 compared to 0.5% of total gross margin in 2020. For 2020, the 417-basis point increase was also primarily attributable to the entertainment segment’s gross margin increases due to strategic promotional and pricing initiatives.
Total Operating Expenses
Total operating expenses were $233,341, $174,993 and $216,162 for fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively, representing an increase of $58,348 or 33% from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021, and a decrease of $41,169 or 19.0% from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were 42.3%, 38.5% and 43.1% for fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively. For 2021, the increase in operating expenses is primarily due to the incremental operating expenses generated from the completed 2021 acquisitions of 1-2-3.tv, Synacor’s Portal and Advertising Business, Christopher & Banks, and TCO. These incremental operating costs from these acquisitions accounted for approximately 60% of the consolidated increase in total operating expenses. Additionally, in 2021 we incurred $6,974 of one-time transaction and transition costs associated with the 2021 acquisitions. Operating expenses also increased as a result of increased variable distribution and selling expenses and general and administrative expenses in the entertainment segment. Restructuring cost for 2021 were $634. For 2020, the decrease in operating expenses of $41,169 is due to the decline in distribution and selling expenses and lower general and administrative expenses.
Distribution and selling
Distribution and selling expense for fiscal 2021 increased $28,592, or 22.0%, to $158,512 or 28.8% of net sales compared to $129,920 or 28.6% of net sales in fiscal 2020. Approximately 70%, or $19,690, of the distribution and selling expense increase during fiscal 2021 is attributable to incremental distribution and selling expenses of the acquisitions of 1-2-3.tv, Synacor’s Portal and Advertising Business, Christopher & Banks, and TCO completed in 2021, and by the entertainment segment’s increased program distribution costs of $3,090. For 2020, the $40,667 decrease in distribution and selling expenses was primarily due to the entertainment segment’s decreased program distribution expenses, payroll and benefits, digital marketing expenses and other selling expenses.
General and administrative
General and administrative expense was $38,589, $20,336 and $25,611 for fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively, representing an increase of $18,253 or 89.8% from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021, and a decrease of $5,275 or 20.6% from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 7.0%, 4.5% and 5.1% for fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. For 2021, approximately 61%, or $11,129, of the $18,253 increase in general and administrative expense was due to the incremental general and administrative expenses generated from the acquisitions completed in 2021, plus $6,974 in one-time transaction and transition costs associated with these acquisitions. For 2020, the $5,275 decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to decreased payroll and benefits, reduced share-based compensation and other general expenses.
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense was $35,606, $24,022 and $8,057 for fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively, representing an increase of $11,584 from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021, and an increase of $15,965 or 198.2% from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales was 6.5%, 5.3% and 1.6% for fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively. For 2021, the $11,584 increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the entertainment segment’s increased broadcast rights amortization expense and the incremental depreciation and amortization expenses generated from the four acquisitions completed in 2021, including 1-2-3.tv, Synacor’s Portal and Advertising Business, Christopher & Banks, and TCO. For 2020, the $15,965 increase in depreciation and amortization expenses was primarily related to increased broadcast rights amortization expense.
Restructuring costs
Restructuring costs were $634, $715 and $9,166 for fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively, representing a decrease of $81 or 11.3% from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 and a decrease of $8,451 or 92.2% from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020. These costs in 2021, 2020, and 2019 were all related to our continued organizational optimization of our staffing, policies, and procedures that collectively work together to improve the velocity, quality, and decentralization of decision-making in the organization, to reduce the duplication of organizational effort, and to reduce costs. Fiscal 2019 represented the largest number and most financially impactful of these, which resulted in the most significant restructuring costs.
Interest expense, net
Interest expense, net was $11,528, $5,234 and $3,760 for fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively, representing an increase of $6,294 or 120.3% from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 and an increase of $1,474 or 39.2% from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020. For 2021, the increase in net interest expense was primarily related to the $2,712 of interest expense on the $80,000 in 8.50% Senior Unsecured Bonds issued to finance the acquisition of 1-2-3.tv in 2021. In addition, we incurred higher interest expense in fiscal 2021 resulting from higher broadcast rights liabilities and higher average senior borrowings under the Siena and GreenLake credit facilities, respectively. For 2020, the increase in net interest expense was primarily related to television broadcast rights liabilities.
Effect of foreign exchange rates
In November of 2021, we acquired a foreign subsidiary, 1-2-3.tv, which reports its financial information in Euros. For the year ended January 29, 2022, we recognized foreign translation adjustments of ($2,428), which is part of other comprehensive income. Below is a summary of changes in foreign exchange rates for fiscal 2021 and 2020:
The average exchange rate was $1.176 for the year ended January 29, 2022 and $1.151 for the year ended January 30, 2021. Below is a summary of the potential effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our pro forma financial information for the year ended January 29, 2022 if we had acquired 1-2-3.tv as of the beginning of the fiscal year:
Income tax provision
Our effective tax rate was (0.5)%, (0.5)% and 0.0%, for years ended January 29, 2022, January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020. We have not recorded any income tax benefit on the losses recorded during fiscal 2021, 2020 or 2019 due to the uncertainty of realizing income tax benefits in the future as indicated by our recording of an income tax valuation allowance. We will continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, including those related to net operating loss carryforwards, until we believe it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized in the future.
Net Loss Attributable to Shareholders
We had net losses attributable to shareholders of $22,008, $13,234, and $56,296 for the years ended January 29, 2022, January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020. The change in net loss attributable to shareholders was a result of the above-described fluctuations in our net sales and expenses.
Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation
To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we also disclose Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below). Adjusted EBITDA was $41,647, $23,913, and ($18,391) for the years ended January 29, 2022, January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the net loss attributable to shareholders to Adjusted EBITDA:
(a) Includes depreciation of $11,018, $10,662 and $10,661, which includes distribution facility depreciation of $3,755, $3,955 and $3,957 for the years ended January 29, 2022, January 30, 2021, and February 1, 2020, respectively. Distribution facility depreciation is included as a component of cost of sales within the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The year ended January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021 includes amortization expense related to the television distribution rights totaling $26,956 and $16,902, respectively. The year ended January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021 includes amortization expense related to intangible assets totaling $1,416 and $415, respectively.
(b) EBITDA as defined for this statistical presentation represents net income (loss) for the respective periods excluding depreciation and amortization expense, interest income (expense) and income taxes. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding non-operating gains (losses); transaction, settlement and integration costs, net; restructuring costs; costs related to the Kentucky tornado; non-cash impairment charges and write downs; executive and management transition costs; one-time customer concessions; rebranding costs; gain on sale of television station; and non-cash share-based compensation expense.
(c) Transaction, settlement and integration costs for the year ended January 29, 2022 include approximately $1,899 of transaction and transition costs related to our acquisition of 1-2-3.tv, approximately $2,304 of transaction and transition costs related to our acquisition of Christopher & Banks, $641 of transaction and transition costs related to our acquisition of Synacor’s Advertising and Portal business. Transaction, settlement and integration costs for the year ended January 30, 2021 include consulting fees incurred to explore additional loan financings, settlement costs, professional fees related to the TheCloseOut.com transaction, and incremental COVID-19 related legal costs. Transaction, settlement and integration costs, net, for year ended February 1, 2020 includes contract settlement costs of $1,200; business acquisition and integration-related costs of $246 to acquire Float Left and J.W. Hulme; costs incurred related to the implementation of our ShopHQ VIP customer loyalty program and our third-party logistics service offerings of $658, costs incurred to amend our Articles of Incorporation and to effect a reverse stock split of our common stock, partially offset by a $1,500 gain for the sale of our claim related to the Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation class action lawsuit.
We have included the term “Adjusted EBITDA” in our reconciliation in order to adequately assess the operating strength and performance of our businesses. The Management team uses this measure to evaluate our business and make decisions about allocating resources to businesses and strategic initiatives. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure to evaluate operating performance under our incentive compensation programs. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for operating income or loss, net income or loss or cash flows from operating activities and other measures as prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Results of Operations - Reporting Segments
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain statement of operations data for each segment.
The entertainment segment continued to be our most significant segment in 2021 based on net sales, gross margin, and operating income (loss). The consumer brands segment had the highest rate of sales growth for fiscal 2021, with an increase of 1,958%. The consumer brands segment also had the highest gross margin rate, 49.5% for fiscal 2021. The results of operations for each segment and significant changes from year to year are discussed below.
Entertainment Segment
The entertainment segment is comprised of our television networks: ShopHQ, ShopBulldogTV, ShopHQHealth, ShopJewelryHQ and 1-2-3.tv. The following table summarizes net sales by product category and other information from statements of operations for the entertainment segment:
Entertainment net sales increased $33,493 or 7.5% and decreased $50,717 or 10.2% for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. For 2021, the increase in net sales was primarily due to the acquisition of 1-2-3.tv and growth in the Jewelry & Watches and Fashion & Accessories product lines, offset by decreases in Health, Beauty & Wellness, for ShopHQ. For 2020, the decrease in net sales was primarily due to our priority to increase our gross margin by reducing sales of less profitable products, particularly in consumer electronics.
Entertainment gross margin percentage was 40.2%, 36.8% and 32.8% for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For 2021, the 341-basis point improvement was primarily attributable to continued price optimization and product mix shift to higher margin rate categories, such as jewelry and watches, fashion, and beauty. For 2020, the 398-basis point increase was also primarily attributable to the gross margin increases due to strategic promotional and pricing initiatives.
Entertainment operating loss was (2.8)%, (1.4)% and (10.0)% for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively. For 2021, the increase in operating loss as a percentage of sales was due to an increase in program distribution expense of $3,090 and an increase in broadcast rights amortization. For 2020, the $43,437 improvement in Operating income was primarily due to margin improvement and cost saving initiatives.
Consumer Brands Segment
The consumer brands segment is comprised of Christopher & Banks (“C&B”), J.W. Hulme Company (“JW”), Cooking with Shaquille O’Neal (“Shaq”), OurGalleria.com and TheCloseout.com (“TCO”). The following table
summarizes net sales by product category and other information from statements of operations for the consumer brands segment:
Consumer brands net sales for the consumer brands segment increased $42,192 or 1,958% and decreased $119 or 5.2% for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For 2021, the increase in net sales was primarily due to the 2021 acquisitions of C&B and TCO. C&B and TCO contributed approximately 83% and 11%, respectively, of consumer brands net sales for fiscal 2021. eCommerce sales contributed over 91% of the sales growth in fiscal 2021. For 2020, the decrease in net sales was primarily due to the negative impact of COVID-19 on our brick-and-mortar locations, which negatively impacted store sales at JW.
Consumer brands gross margin percentage was 49.5%, 41.5% and 35.0% for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For fiscal 2021, the 803-basis point improvement was primarily due to the 2021 acquisition of C&B, which has a standalone gross margin percentage of 54.0%. For fiscal 2020, the 652-basis point increase was primarily the result of continued promotions and pricing initiatives.
Consumer brands operating income (loss) as a percentage of sales was 3.6%, (74.2)%, and (84.8)% for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in operating income as a percentage of sales in 2021 is primarily attributable to investments made in marketing campaigns and direct-to-consumer catalogs designed to reinvigorate the C&B customer base to drive sales in the near-term and create customer lifetime value through customer reactivation and acquisition. For 2020, we were not able to leverage the fixed operating expenses primarily for JW Hulme, which continues to be a brand that has long-term value.
Media Commerce Services Segment
The media commerce services segment is comprised of iMedia Digital Services (“iMDS”), Float Left (“FL”) and i3PL. The following table summarizes net sales by product category and other information from statements of operations for the consumer brands segment:
Media commerce services net sales increased $21,278 or 324.2% and $3,185 or 94.3% for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For 2021, the increase in net sales was primarily due to the acquisition of iMDS (Synacor acquisition), which contributed approximately 79% to sales for fiscal 2021. For 2020, the increase in net sales was primarily due to the acquisition of FL.
Media commerce services gross margin percentage was 29.0%, 34.5% and 1.1% for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For fiscal 2021, the 541-basis point decrease was primarily due to the shift to lower-margin portal and advertising services through the acquisition of iMDS. For fiscal 2020, the 3,340-basis point increase was primarily the result of growth in the higher-margin OTT service line through the acquisition of FL.
Media commerce services operating income (loss) was 4.2% and (0.8)% of sales for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. For 2021, the increase in operating income as a percentage of sales is primarily due to the acquisition of iMDS. For 2020, labor investments in the business did not deliver anticipated results, which inflated the cost as a percentage of net sales as we were not able to leverage operating expenses in fiscal 2020.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of January 29, 2022, we had cash of $11,295 and $11,400 of availability on the Siena Credit Facility. In addition, under the Sienna Credit Facility, we are required to maintain a minimum of $7,500 of unrestricted cash plus unused line availability at all times. As of January 30, 2021, we had cash of $15,485. During fiscal 2021, working capital increased $38,445 to $72,108 compared to working capital of $33,663 for fiscal 2020 (see “Cash Requirements” below for additional information on changes in working capital accounts). The current ratio (our total current assets divided by total current liabilities) improved to 1.4 at January 29, 2022 compared to 1.2 at January 30, 2021.
Sources of Liquidity
Our principal source of liquidity is our available cash and our additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility with Siena Lending Group, LLC (“Siena”). As of January 29, 2022, we had cash of $11,295 and additional borrowing capacity of $11,400.

We received related net proceeds of $73,700 after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us (including fees and reimbursements to the underwriters). The Notes were issued under an indenture, dated September 28, 2021 (the “Base Indenture”), between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated September 28, 2021 (the “Supplemental Indenture,” and the Base Indenture as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture, the “Indenture”), between us and the Trustee.

We may redeem the Notes for cash in whole or in part at any time at our option (i) on or after September 30, 2023 and prior to September 30, 2024, at a price equal to $25.75 per note, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption, (ii) on or after September 30, 2024 and prior to September 30, 2025, at a price equal to $25.50 per note, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption, and (iii) on or after September 30, 2025 and prior to maturity, at a price equal to $25.25 per note, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. The Indenture provides for events of default that may, in certain circumstances, lead to the outstanding principal and unpaid interest of the Notes becoming immediately due and payable. If a Mandatory Redemption Event (as defined in the Supplemental Indenture) occurs, we will have an obligation to redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, within 45 days after the occurrence of the Mandatory Redemption Event at a redemption price in cash equal to $25.50 per note plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

Debt issuance costs, net of amortization, relating to the Notes were $5,925 and $0 as of January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, respectively and are included as a direct reduction to the 8.50% Senior Unsecured Notes liability balance within the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The balance of these costs is being expensed as additional interest over the five-year term of the 8.50% Senior Unsecured Notes.
Siena Credit Facility
On July 30, 2021, we and certain of our subsidiaries, as borrowers, entered into a loan and security agreement (as amended through September 20, 2021, the “Loan Agreement”) with Siena Lending Group LLC and the other lenders party thereto from time to time, Siena Lending Group LLC, as agent (the “Agent”), and certain additional of our subsidiaries, as guarantors thereunder.

Private Placement Securities Purchase Agreement
On April 14, 2020, we entered into a common stock and warrant purchase agreement with certain individuals and entities, pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 1,836,314 shares of our common stock, issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 979,190 shares of our common stock at a price of $2.66 per share, and fully-paid warrants to purchase an aggregate 114,698 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.001 per share in a private placement, for an aggregate cash purchase price of $4,000.

Additional closings occurred on May 22, 2020, June 8, 2020, June 12, 2020 and July 11, 2020 and we received gross proceeds of $2,500. We incurred approximately $190 of issuance costs during the first half of fiscal 2020. The Warrants are indexed to our publicly traded stock and were classified as equity. The par value of the shares issued was recorded within common stock, with the remainder of the proceeds, less issuance costs, recorded as additional paid in capital in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. We used the proceeds for general working capital purposes.
The purchasers consisted of the following: Invicta Media Investments, LLC, Michael and Leah Friedman and Hacienda Jackson LLC. Invicta Media Investments, LLC is owned by Invicta Watch Company of America, Inc. (“IWCA”), which is the designer and manufacturer of Invicta-branded watches and watch accessories, one of our largest and longest tenured brands. Michael and Leah Friedman are owners and officers of Sterling Time, LLC (“Sterling Time”), which is the exclusive distributor of IWCA’s watches and watch accessories for television home shopping and our long-time vendor. IWCA is owned by our Vice Chair and director, Eyal Lalo, and Michael Friedman also serves as one of our directors. A description of the relationship between us, IWCA and Sterling Time is contained in Note 19 - “Related Party Transactions.” Further, Invicta Media Investments, LLC and Michael and Leah Friedman comprise a “group” of investors within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that is our largest shareholder.
The warrants have an exercise price per share of $2.66 and are exercisable at any time and from time to time from six months following their issuance date until April 14, 2025. We have included a blocker provision in the purchase agreement whereby no purchaser may be issued shares of our common stock if the purchaser would own over 19.999% of our outstanding common stock and, to the extent a purchaser in this offering would own over 19.999% of our outstanding common stock, that purchaser will receive fully-paid warrants (in contrast to the coverage warrants that will be issued in this transaction, as described above) in lieu of the shares that would place such holder’s ownership over 19.999%. Further, we included a similar blocker in the warrants (and amended the warrants purchased by the purchasers on May 2, 2019, if any) whereby no purchaser of the warrants may exercise a warrant if the holder would own over 19.999% of our outstanding common stock.
Other
Our ValuePay program is an installment payment program offered to customers in our entertainment and consumer brands reporting segments, which allows customers to pay by credit card for certain merchandise in two or more equal monthly installments with no interest charge. As of January 29, 2022, we had approximately $47,008 of net receivables due from customers under the ValuePay program. A source of near-term liquidity is our ability to increase our cash flow resources by reducing the percentage of our sales offered under our ValuePay installment program or by decreasing the length of time we extend credit to our customers under this installment program. However, any such change to the terms of our ValuePay installment program could impact future sales, particularly for products sold with higher price points. The customer demand for “buy now pay later” options has created a competitive platform for third-party providers to develop and offer favorable “buy now pay later” payments options for consumers that could potentially benefit retailers. Those benefits include; sales growth, immediate cash flow to the retailer and reduction/elimination in collection risk. The risk of payment and working capital requirements, could potentially reside with the third-party providers. Please see “Cash Requirements” below for a discussion of our ValuePay installment program.
Cash Requirements
Currently, our principal cash requirements are to fund our business operations and to fund our debt service. We closely manage our cash resources and our working capital. In our entertainment and consumer brands segments, we attempt to manage our inventory receipts and reorders in order to ensure our inventory investment levels remain commensurate with our current sales trends. We also monitor the collection of our credit card and ValuePay installment receivables and manage our vendor payment terms in order to more effectively manage our working capital which includes matching cash receipts from our customers to the extent possible, with related cash payments to our vendors. ValuePay remains a cost-effective promotional tool for us. We continue to make strategic use of our ValuePay program in an effort to increase sales and to respond to similar competitive programs.
Our ability to fund operations, debt service and capital expenditures in the future will be dependent on our ability to generate cash flow from operations, maintain margins and to use available funds from our Siena Loan Agreement. Our ability to borrow funds is dependent on our ability to maintain an adequate borrowing base, and our ability to meet our credit facility’s covenants. Accordingly, if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our working capital needs, debt service payments and planned capital expenditures and meet credit facility covenants, and our cash reserves are depleted, we may need to take actions that are within our control, such as further reductions or delays in capital investments, additional reductions to our workforce, reducing or delaying strategic investments or other actions. We believe our existing cash balances and our availability under the Siena Loan Agreement, will be sufficient to fund our normal business operations over the next twelve months from the issuance of this report.
Our entertainment segment brands like ShopHQ and 1-2-3.tv have significant future commitments for our cash, primarily payments for cable and satellite program distribution obligations and the eventual repayment of our credit facility. As of January 29, 2022, we had total contractual cash obligations and commitments primarily with respect to our cable and satellite agreements, credit facility, operating leases, and finance lease payments totaling approximately $407,900 coming due over the next five fiscal years.
For fiscal 2021, net cash used for operating activities totaled $49,976 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $6,231 in fiscal 2020 and net cash used for operating activities of $6,157 in fiscal 2019. Net cash used by operating activities for fiscal 2021 reflects a net loss, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization, share-based payment compensation, payments for television distribution rights, amortization of deferred financing costs and loss on debt extinguishment. In addition, net cash used for operating activities for fiscal 2021 reflects increases in inventories, accounts receivable, and prepaid expenses and other, and a decrease in deferred revenue and accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Inventories increased primarily as a result of the growth of inventory to support the Christopher and Banks business and additional inventory purchases made within the entertainment segment during Q3 to ensure we were not negatively impacted by logistic delays during our Q4.
For fiscal 2020, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $6,231 compared to net cash used for operating activities of $6,157 in fiscal 2019. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2020 reflects a net loss, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization, share-based payment compensation, payments for television distribution rights and amortization of deferred financing costs. In addition, net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2020 reflects decreases in inventories, accounts receivable and prepaid expenses, and an increase in deferred revenue; partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Inventories decreased primarily as a result of disciplined management of overall working capital components commensurate with sales. Accounts receivable decreased primarily due to lower sales levels, as well as a slight decrease in the utilization of our ValuePay installment program. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased during the first nine months of fiscal 2020 primarily due to a decrease in inventory payables as a result of lower inventory levels and timing of payments to vendors, a decrease in accrued severance resulting from our 2019 cost optimization initiative and 2019 executive and management transition, and a decrease in accrued cable distribution fees.
Net cash used for investing activities totaled $116,448 for fiscal 2021 compared to net cash used for investing activities of $4,892 for fiscal 2020. Net cash used for investing activities included expenditures for business acquisitions totaling $100,411 in fiscal 2021 and $0 in fiscal 2020. The 2021 expenditures for business acquisitions included $76,911 net, for 1-2-3.tv, $20,000 for Synacor’s Ad and Portal business, and $3,500 for Christopher & Banks. Expenditures for property and equipment were $10,037 in fiscal 2021 compared to $4,892 in fiscal 2020. The increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily related to expenditures made for building improvements made at our Eden
Prairie facility. Additional capital expenditures made during the periods presented relate primarily to the development, upgrade and replacement of computer software, order management, merchandising and warehouse management systems, related computer equipment, digital broadcasting equipment, and other office equipment, warehouse equipment and production equipment. Principal future capital expenditures are expected to include: the development, upgrade and replacement of various enterprise software systems; equipment improvements and technology upgrades at our distribution facility in Bowling Green, Kentucky; security upgrades to our information technology; and related computer and other equipment associated with the expansion of our entertainment, consumer brands and media commerce services business segments. During fiscal 2021, we also provided a cash deposit of $6,000 to a vendor to be used as working capital pursuant to a related exclusivity agreement.
Net cash used for investing activities totaled $4,892 for fiscal 2020 compared to net cash used for investing activities of $7,784 for fiscal 2019. Expenditures for property and equipment were $4,892 in fiscal 2020 compared to $7,146 in fiscal 2019. The decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily related to expenditures made for the upgrades in our customer service call routing technology during fiscal 2019. Additional capital expenditures made during the periods presented relate primarily to the development, upgrade and replacement of computer software, order management, merchandising and warehouse management systems, related computer equipment, digital broadcasting equipment, and other office equipment, warehouse equipment and production equipment.

The Loan Agreement also requires we maintain a maximum senior net leverage ratios for each quarter. In addition, the Loan Agreement places restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness or prepay existing indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to sell or otherwise dispose of assets, to merge or consolidate with other entities, and to make certain restricted payments, including payments of dividends to shareholders.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to the realizability of accounts receivable, inventory and product returns. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Management believes the following critical accounting policies estimates affect the more significant assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements:
● Accounts receivable. In our entertainment and consumer brands reporting segments, we utilize an installment payment program called ValuePay in our entertainment segment that entitles customers to purchase merchandise and pay for the merchandise in two or more equal monthly credit card installments in which we bear the risk of collection. The percentage of our net sales generated utilizing our ValuePay payment program over the past three fiscal years ranged from 50% to 57%. As of January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, we had approximately $47,008 and $49,736 due from customers under the ValuePay installment program. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Estimates are used in determining the provision for doubtful accounts and are based on historical rates of actual write offs and delinquency rates, historical collection experience, credit policy, current trends in the credit quality of our customer base, average length of ValuePay offers, average selling prices, our sales mix and accounts receivable aging. The provision for doubtful accounts, which is primarily related to our ValuePay program, for fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2019 was $4,067, $4,900, and $7,311, which is included in distribution and selling expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Based on our fiscal 2021 bad debt expense, a one-half point increase or decrease in bad debt expense as a percentage of total net sales would have an impact of approximately $1,100 on consolidated distribution and selling expense.
● Inventory. In our entertainment and consumer brands reporting segments, we value our inventory, which consists primarily of consumer merchandise held for resale, principally at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. As of January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, we had inventory balances of $116,256 and $68,715. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the following factors: age of the inventory and the historical margins on the sales of aged inventory, estimated required sell-through time, stage of product life cycle and whether items are selling below cost. In determining appropriate reserve percentages, we look at our historical write off experience, the specific merchandise categories affected, our historic recovery percentages on various methods of liquidations, return to vendor contract rights, forecasts of future planned receipts, forecasts of inventory levels, forecasts of future product airings and current markdown processes. Provision for excess and obsolete inventory for fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019$62, $5,512 and $8,798. The fiscal 2019 provision includes a non-cash inventory write-down of $6,050 resulting from a change in our merchandise strategy (see Note 17 - “Inventory Impairment Write-down” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements). Based on our fiscal 2021 inventory provision experience, a 10% increase or decrease in inventory write downs would have had an impact of approximately $6 on consolidated gross profit.
● Merchandise returns. In our entertainment and consumer brands reporting segments, we record a merchandise return liability as a reduction of gross sales for anticipated merchandise returns at each reporting period and must make estimates of potential future merchandise returns related to current period product revenue. Our return rates on our total net sales were 16.0% in fiscal 2021, 14.8% in fiscal 2020, and 19.4% in fiscal 2019. We estimate and evaluate the adequacy of our merchandise returns liability by analyzing historical returns by merchandise category, looking at current economic trends and changes in customer demand and by analyzing the acceptance of new product lines. Assumptions and estimates are made and used in connection with establishing the merchandise return liability in any accounting period. As of January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, we recorded a merchandise return liability of $8,126 and $5,271, included in accrued liabilities, and a right of return asset of $3,770 and $2,749, included in other current assets. Based on our fiscal 2021 sales returns, a one-point increase or decrease in our returns rate would have had an impact of approximately $2,700 on gross profit.
● Business combinations. We account for business combinations under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805 “Business Combinations” using the acquisition method of accounting, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value is recorded as
goodwill. All acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. Upon acquisition, the accounts and results of operations are consolidated as of and subsequent to the acquisition date.
● Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, of a business acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment tests as of the first day of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying amount may be impaired, such as changes in the business climate, poor indicators of operating performance or the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. When testing goodwill, the Company has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than their respective carrying amounts as the basis to determine if it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. If the Company chooses not to complete a qualitative assessment, or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit or the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceed their respective estimated fair values, a quantitative test is required. In performing a quantitative impairment test, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit and with their respective carrying amounts. If the carrying amounts of the reporting unit exceed their respective fair values, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to the difference, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. There was no impairment of goodwill for the years ended January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021; however, events such as prolonged economic weakness or unexpected significant declines in operating results of any of our reporting units or businesses, may result in goodwill impairment charges in the future.
● Intangible Assets. Identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. There was no impairment of intangible assets for the years ended January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021; however, events such as prolonged economic weakness or unexpected significant declines in operating results of any of our reporting units or businesses, may result in intangible asset impairment charges in the future.
