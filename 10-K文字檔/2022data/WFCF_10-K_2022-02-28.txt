RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020
The following table shows information for reportable operating business segments:
Verification and Certification Segment
Verification and certification service revenues consist of fees charged for verification audits and other verification and certification related services that the Company performs for customers. Fees earned from our WFCF labeling program are also included in our verification and certification revenues as it represents a value-added extension of our source verification. Verification and certification service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased approximately $1.8 million, or 12.7% compared to 2020. Overall, the increase is due primarily to increased customer demand for our product offerings.
Our product sales are an ancillary part of our verification and certification services and represent sales of cattle identification ear tags. Product sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased slightly by approximately $29,000, or 0.8% compared to 2020. Overall, our product sales have been stable in response to the requirement for source and age verification using an identification tag at birth for cattle.
Costs of revenues (for services and product sales) for the verification and certification segment for the year ended December 31, 2021 were approximately $10.8 million compared to approximately $9.9 million in 2020. Gross margin (including intercompany sales) for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased slightly to 45.5% compared to 44.7% in 2020. The changes are primarily due to a change in product mix of our offerings which included new customers and new offerings. Our margins are generally impacted by various costs such as cost of products, salaries and benefits, insurance and taxes.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased 14.1% compared to 2020. Overall, the increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses is due to increased discretionary compensation expense, public listing costs and in part to an increase in depreciation, amortization and personnel costs from shifting certain assets and personnel from SureHarvest to WFCF in 2020 to better support the entire Company.
Software and Related Consulting Segment
Software and related consulting revenue is a revenue stream specific to our acquisitions of SureHarvest and Postelsia. Offerings include a wide range of professional consulting services and technology solutions that support our verification business and generate incremental revenue specific to the food and agricultural industry. For the year ended December 31, 2021, software and related consulting service revenue increased approximately 4.1% over 2020 predominately due to the acquisition of Postelsia during 2020, offset by customer-related budget delays for significant software enhancements because of COVID-19 concerns which results in a decrease in the number of billable hours of staff focused on software enhancements and upgrades.
Costs of revenues for our software and related consulting segment for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $1.4 and $1.2 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, gross margin (including intercompany sales) had decreased to 33.9% from 40.6% in 2020. The decrease in gross margin is due primarily to increased cost of labor to support our enhancements to our customer’s technology.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased 56.7% compared to 2020. The decrease is predominately due to the decrease in depreciation, amortization and personnel costs from shifting certain assets and personnel from SureHarvest to WFCF in 2020 to better support the entire Company.
As with all of our acquisitions, we continue to identify synergies and implement best practices. We focus our efforts to create value in various ways such as improving the performance of our acquired businesses, removing excess capacity, creating market access for products, acquiring skills and technologies more quickly or at a lower cost than we can build in-house, exploiting our industry-specific scalability and bundling opportunities, and picking winners early and helping them develop their businesses. Achieving any or all of these strategies take time to implement. We have learned that it can take two to three years after an acquisition to fully understand the complexities, at which time, we have generally seen solid improvements in revenues and/or costs.
Dividend Income from Progressive Beef, LLC
On August 9, 2018, the Company purchased a ten percent membership interest in Progressive Beef, LLC (“Progressive Beef”) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.0 million. The Company received dividend income of $200,000 and $150,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, from Progressive Beef representing a distribution of their earnings.
Income Tax Expense
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded income tax expense of approximately $0.7 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 24.6% compared to a federal corporate rate of 21.0%. The effective tax rate for 2021 is favorably impacted by the non-taxability of the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP) loan forgiveness income. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 21.0%.
Net Income and Per Share Information
As a result of the foregoing, net income attributable to WFCF shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2021 was approximately $3.0 million or $0.49 per basic and $0.48 per diluted common share, compared to approximately $1.4 million or $0.23 per basic and $0.22 per diluted common share in 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $5.4 million compared to approximately $4.4 million at December 31, 2020. Our working capital at December 31, 2021 was approximately $5.7 million compared to approximately $4.4 million at December 31, 2020.
Net cash provided by operating activities during 2021 was approximately $3.0 million compared to $2.5 million during the same period in 2020. Net cash provided by operating activities is driven by an increase in our net income and adjusted by non-cash items and changes in current assets and liabilities. Non-cash adjustments primarily include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, forgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program loan, and deferred taxes. Fluctuations are primarily due to operating performance offset by the timing of cash receipts and cash disbursements. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2021 was primarily driven by an increase in deferred revenue, decrease in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other assets, offset by cash used for inventory.
Net cash used in investing activities during 2021 was approximately $3,000 compared to $0.7 million during 2020. Net cash used in the 2021 period was $0.2 million for the purchase of a vehicle, equipment and software development offset by $0.2 million in proceeds from the sale of the Medina land and building. Net cash used in the 2020 period was $0.3 million cash paid in the acquisition of Postelsia and $0.5 million for the purchase of equipment and software development.
Net cash used in financing activities during 2021 was approximately $2.0 million compared to net cash provided of $14,000 in the 2020 period. Net cash used in the 2021 period was $1.1 million for the repurchase of common shares under the Stock Buyback Plan and $0.9 million in dividends paid to shareholders. Cash provided during 2020 of $1.0 million was from loan proceeds offset by $1.0 million for the repurchase of common shares under the Stock Buyback Plan.
Over the past several years, our growth has been funded primarily through cashflows from operations. We continually evaluate all funding options, including additional offerings of our securities to private, public and institutional investors and other credit facilities as they become available.
The primary driver of our operating cash flow is our third-party verification solutions, specifically the gross margin generated from services provided. Therefore, we focus on the elements of those operations, including revenue growth, gross margin and long-term projects that ensure a steady stream of operating profits to enable us to meet our cash obligations. On a weekly basis, we review the performance of each of our revenue streams focusing on third-party verification solutions compared with prior periods and our operating plan. We believe that our various sources of capital, including cash flow from operating activities, overall improvement in our performance, and our ability to obtain additional financing, are adequate to finance current operations as well as the repayment of current debt obligations. We are not aware of any other event or trend that would negatively affect our liquidity. In the event such a trend develops, we believe that there are sufficient financing avenues available to us and from our internal cash-generating capabilities to adequately manage our ongoing business.
The culmination of all our efforts has brought significant opportunities to us, including increased investor confidence and renewed interest in our company, as well as the potential to develop business relationships with long-term strategic partners. In keeping with our core business, we will continue to review our business model with a focus on profitability, long-term capital solutions and the potential impact of acquisitions or divestitures, if such an opportunity arises.
Our plan for continued growth is primarily based on diversification in our product offerings within national and international markets, as well as, potential acquisitions. We believe that there are significant growth opportunities available to us because of growing consumer awareness and demand on a national level. Internationally, a quality verification program is often the only way to overcome import or export restrictions.
Debt Facility
The Company has a revolving line of credit (“LOC”) agreement which matures April 12, 2022. The LOC provides for $75,080 in working capital. The interest rate is at the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus 1.50% and is adjusted daily. Principal and interest are payable upon demand, but if demand is not made, then annual payments of accrued interest only are due, with the principal balance due upon maturity. As of December 31, 2021, and 2020, the effective interest rate was 4.75%. The LOC is collateralized by all the business assets of Where Food Comes From Organic, Inc. (“WFCFO”), a subsidiary of WFCF. As of December 31, 2021, and 2020, there were no amounts outstanding under this LOC.
On April 17, 2020, the Company received a $1.0 million loan under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) with a maturity date of April 17, 2022 and an annual interest rate of 1.00%. The Company received notification the loan and accrued interest amount was forgiven on March 4, 2021.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2021, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements of any type.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Below is a discussion of the accounting policies and related estimates that we believe are the most critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements, financial condition and results of operations and which require complex management judgments, uncertainties and/or estimates. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a reporting period; however, actual results could differ from those estimates. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of the critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Information regarding our other accounting policies is included in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Revenue Recognition
Verification and Certification Segment
We offer a range of products and services to maintain identification, traceability, and verification systems. We conduct both on-site and desk audits to verify that claims being made about livestock, food, other high-value specialty crops and agricultural products are accurate. We generate revenue primarily from the sale of our verification solutions, consulting services and hardware sales. We sell our products and services directly to customers at various levels in the livestock and agricultural supply chains.
Verification and certification service revenue primarily consists of fees charged for verification audits and other verification services that the Company performs for customers. We recognize revenue utilizing an input method to measure over-time progress of each verification audit based on the number of audit days performed.
For certain of our third-party crop and other processed product audits, we assess a fixed fee for the annual certification period. We recognize revenue utilizing an input method to measure progress toward satisfaction of the annual assessment based on the percentage of activities/phases or input reviews completed under the annual assessment.
Product sales are primarily generated from the sale of cattle identification ear tags. Revenue for product sales is recognized upon delivery of the goods to customer, at which point title, custody and risk of loss transfer to the customer.
We had deferred revenue of approximately $1.0 million and $0.9 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, primarily related to the annual certification period for certain of our third-party crop and other processed product audits. The balance of these contract liabilities at the beginning of the period is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2022.
Software and Related Consulting Segment
Consulting services fees are derived from a standard rate card by employee level, and we invoice for consulting services monthly on a time-incurred basis. We recognize revenue over time utilizing the practical expedient that allows us to recognize revenue in the amount to which we have a right to invoice.
We also offer software products via a SaaS model, which is an annual subscription-based model. Support services and web-hosting are generally included in the subscription.
We recognize revenue related to the SaaS arrangement over an annual subscription period utilizing a time-based output measure of progress that results in a straight-line attribution of revenue. We had deferred revenue of approximately $0.5 and $0.2 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, primarily due to the SaaS arrangements.
In connection with web-hosting services under our SaaS arrangements, we present revenue on a gross basis, with consideration received from our customer for the web-hosting service recorded as revenue and the cost paid to the third-party to provide those web-hosting services recorded as an expense.
Other
Generally, we do not provide right of return or warranty on product sales or services performed.
In connection with the provision of on-site audits, reimbursable expenses are incurred and billed to customers, and such amounts are recognized on a gross basis as both revenue and cost of revenue.
Any amounts collected on behalf of a third-party and remitted in full to that third-party are excluded from the transaction price and, thus, revenue.
Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Significant portions of our verification and certification service revenue is typically realized during late May through early October when the calf marketings and the growing seasons are at their peak. Although this seasonality does not impact our policies for revenue recognition, it does generally impact our results of operations by potentially causing an increase in our profit margins during May through October and decreased margins during November through April.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company recognizes all equity-based compensation as stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the compensation measured at the grant date. For stock options, fair value is calculated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. For restricted stock awards, fair value is the closing stock price for the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The expense is recognized over the vesting period of the grant.
Calculating stock-based compensation expense using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the stock-based awards, stock price volatility, and the pre-vesting option forfeiture rate. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including the types of awards, employee classification and historical experience. Actual forfeitures may differ substantially from our current estimate. Under this pricing model, which incorporates ranges of assumptions for inputs, our assumptions are as follows:
● Dividend yield is based on our historical policy of not paying cash dividends.
● Expected volatility assumptions were derived from our actual volatilities.
● The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the date of grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the expected term at the grant date.
● The expected term of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules, based on historical exercise patterns, which we believe are representative of future behavior.
There is a risk that our estimates of the fair values may differ from the actual values. It is possible that employee stock options may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements. Alternatively, value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements. The fair value determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer / willing seller market transaction.
Estimates of share-based compensation expense are highly subjective as to value and have an impact on our financial statements, but these expenses will never result in the payment of cash by us. For this reason, and because we do not view share-based compensation as being related to our operational performance, we exclude estimated share-based compensation expense when internally evaluating our performance.
Income Taxes
We record income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes. We determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting. Accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense.
We consider the probability of future taxable income and our historical profitability, among other factors, in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance. Significant judgment is involved in this determination, including projections of future taxable income.
Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions.
Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, our level of earnings and the results of tax audits.
As of December 31, 2021, we concluded that a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets was not considered necessary. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not have an unrecognized tax liability. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the tax provision as recorded.
Goodwill
We perform an impairment test of our goodwill annually or when events and circumstances indicate goodwill might be impaired. Impairment testing of goodwill is required at the reporting unit level and involves a two-step process. However, we may first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.
The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units with the reporting unit’s carrying amount, including goodwill. If we determine that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we perform a second step to compare the carrying amount of goodwill to the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as utilized to recognize goodwill in a business combination. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess.
We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis or when events or circumstances indicate our reporting units might change.
Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including performing the qualitative assessment, the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit.
Estimating the fair value of an individual reporting unit requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, industry and economic conditions and our actual results and conditions may differ over time. Examples of events or circumstances that could have a negative effect on the estimated fair value of our reporting units include (i) changes in technology or customer demands that were not anticipated; (ii) competition or regulatory developments in the industry that may adversely affect profitability; (iii) a prolonged weakness in general economic conditions; (iv) a sustained decrease in share price; (v) volatility in the equity and debt markets which could result in a higher discount rate; and (vi) the inability to execute our strategy to grow our growth products.
These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies.
We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill during the past two years.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had approximately $2.9 million of goodwill.
During the fourth quarter of 2021 and 2020, we performed a qualitative assessment on our WFCFO, Validus and SureHarvest units and concluded that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying value.
Long-Lived Assets
Our definite-lived intangible assets consist of customer relationships, accreditations, tradenames / trademarks and patents related to our acquisitions, recorded at estimated fair value. It also consists of our trademark rights and the related costs incurred to obtain the trademark rights recorded at cost. These definite-lived assets are subject to amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful-lives of the respective assets, which range from two to fifteen years. Estimates of useful-lives are based on the nature of the underlying assets as well as our experience with similar assets and intended use. We periodically review estimated useful-lives for reasonableness.
We evaluate recoverability of long-lived assets, including property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful-lives can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as consumer spending habits and general economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts.
We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology or useful-lives we use to account for long-lived assets during the past two years.
Pursuant to Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 (“ASU”) Topic 842, we determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in the right-of-use (ROU) assets, current operating lease liabilities and noncurrent operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, current finance lease obligations and long-term finance lease obligations in our consolidated balance sheet.
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term.
Indefinite-Lived Assets
Our non-amortizable intangible assets which have an indefinite life relate to the trademarks/tradenames acquired in the Validus acquisition. Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 350, if an intangible asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life, it shall not be amortized until its useful life is determined to no longer be indefinite. Accordingly, we evaluate the remaining useful life of an intangible asset that is not being amortized each reporting period to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life.
In addition, an intangible asset that is not subject to amortization shall be tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Entities testing an indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the asset. If entities determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the likelihood of the indefinite-lived intangible asset being impaired is below a “more-likely-than-not” threshold (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent), the entity would not need to calculate the fair value of the asset.
As of December 31, 2021, there have been no changes to the indefinite life determination pertaining to these intangible assets. Based on the qualitative assessment on Validus reporting unit, we concluded that the likelihood of the indefinite lived asset being impaired was below a “more-likely-than-not” threshold.
Business Combinations
A component of our growth strategy has been to acquire businesses that complement our existing operations. We account for business combinations in accordance with the guidance for business combinations and related literature. Accordingly, we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of purchase. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
In determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, we use various recognized valuation methods, including present value modeling and referenced market values (where available). Further, we make assumptions within certain valuation techniques, including discount rates and the timing of future cash flows. Valuations are performed by management or independent valuation specialists under management’s supervision, where appropriate. We believe that the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions that marketplace participants would use. However, such assumptions are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ from those estimates.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements.
