Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. For discussion of our consolidated and segment-level results of operations, non-GAAP measures, and liquidity and capital resources for fiscal year 2019, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 27, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021.
Overview
We are one of the largest casual dining restaurant companies in the world with a portfolio of leading, differentiated restaurant concepts. As of December 26, 2021, we owned and operated 1,169 full-service restaurants and off-premises only kitchens and franchised 329 full-service restaurants and off-premises only kitchens across 47 states, Guam and 17 countries. We have four founder-inspired concepts: Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba’s Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill and Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar.
Financial Highlights
Our financial highlights for 2021 include the following:
•U.S. combined and Outback Steakhouse comparable restaurant sales of 30.5% and 24.2%, respectively, relative to 2020 and 4.5% and 3.2%, respectively, relative to 2019;
•An increase in Total revenues of 30.0%, as compared to 2020, and a decrease in Total revenues of 0.4%, as compared to 2019;
•Restaurant-level operating margin of 16.5% for 2021, as compared to 9.9% and 14.9% for 2020 and 2019, respectively;
•Decrease in General and administrative expense of $8.7 million and $29.6 million, as compared to 2020 and 2019, respectively;
•Income from operations of $309.0 million in 2021, as compared to Loss from operations of $(175.0) million in 2020 and Income from operations of $191.1 million in 2019; and
•Diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders of $2.00 in 2021 as compared to $(1.85) and $1.45 in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Business Strategies
In 2022, our key business strategies include:
•Enhance the 360-Degree Customer Experience to Drive Sustainable Healthy Sales Growth. We plan to continue to make investments to enhance our core guest experience, increase off-premises dining occasions, remodel and relocate restaurants, invest in digital marketing and data personalization and utilize the Dine Rewards loyalty program and multimedia marketing campaigns to drive sales.
•Drive Long-Term Shareholder Value. We plan to drive long-term shareholder value by reinvesting operational cash flow into our business, improving our credit profile and returning excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
•Enrich Engagement Among Stakeholders. We take the responsibility to our people, customers and communities seriously and continue to invest in programs that support the well-being of those engaged with us.
•Accelerate Growth Opportunities. We believe a substantial development opportunity remains for our concepts in the U.S. and internationally through existing geography fill-in and market expansion. We will

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued
continue to pursue U.S. fill-in opportunities in key states such as Florida and Texas with Outback, and California and Florida with Fleming’s. We will also focus on geographic regions in South America, with strategic expansion in Brazil, and pursue global franchise opportunities.
We intend to fund our business strategies, drive revenue growth and margin improvement, in part by reinvesting savings generated by cost savings and productivity initiatives across our businesses.
Key Financial Performance Indicators
Key measures that we use in evaluating our restaurants and assessing our business include the following:
•Average restaurant unit volumes-average sales (excluding gift card breakage) per restaurant to measure changes in customer traffic, pricing and development of the brand;
•Comparable restaurant sales-year-over-year comparison of the change in sales volumes (excluding gift card breakage) for Company-owned restaurants that are open 18 months or more in order to remove the impact of new restaurant openings in comparing the operations of existing restaurants;
•System-wide sales-total restaurant sales volume for all Company-owned and franchise restaurants, regardless of ownership, to interpret the overall health of our brands;
•Restaurant-level operating margin, Income (loss) from operations, Net income (loss) and Diluted earnings (loss) per share-financial measures utilized to evaluate our operating performance.
Restaurant-level operating margin is widely regarded in the industry as a useful metric to evaluate restaurant-level operating efficiency and performance of ongoing restaurant-level operations, and we use it for these purposes, overall and particularly within our two segments. Our restaurant-level operating margin is expressed as the percentage of our Restaurant sales that Food and beverage costs, Labor and other related expenses and Other restaurant operating expenses (including advertising expenses) represent, in each case as such items are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). The following categories of our revenue and operating expenses are not included in restaurant-level operating margin because we do not consider them reflective of operating performance at the restaurant-level within a period:
(i)Franchise and other revenues which are earned primarily from franchise royalties and other non-food and beverage revenue streams, such as rental and sublease income.
(ii)Depreciation and amortization which, although substantially all of which is related to restaurant-level assets, represent historical sunk costs rather than cash outlays for the restaurants.
(iii)General and administrative expense which includes primarily non-restaurant-level costs associated with support of the restaurants and other activities at our corporate offices.
(iv)Asset impairment charges and restaurant closing costs which are not reflective of ongoing restaurant performance in a period.
Restaurant-level operating margin excludes various expenses, as discussed above, that are essential to support the operations of our restaurants and may materially impact our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). As a result, restaurant-level operating margin is not indicative of our consolidated results of operations and is presented exclusively as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, Net income (loss) or Income (loss) from operations. In addition, our presentation of restaurant operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry; and

REVENUES
Restaurant Sales
Following is a summary of the change in Restaurant sales for the period indicated:
____________________
(1)Summation of quarterly changes for restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales will not total to annual amounts as the restaurants that meet the definition of a comparable restaurant will differ each period based on when the restaurant opened.
The increase in Restaurant sales in 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily due to: (i) higher comparable restaurant sales from recovery of in-restaurant dining from the significantly reduced levels in 2020 after the onset of the pandemic and strong retention of off-premises sales and (ii) the opening of 48 new restaurants not included in our comparable restaurant sales base. The increase in Restaurant sales was partially offset by the closure of 46 restaurants since December 29, 2019 and the effect of foreign currency translation of the Brazilian Real relative to the U.S. dollar.
Average Restaurant Unit Volumes and Operating Weeks
Following is a summary of the average restaurant unit volumes and operating weeks for the periods indicated:

Franchise and other revenues
____________________
(1)Represents franchise royalties, advertising fees and initial franchise fees. Franchise revenues increased during 2021 primarily due to higher franchise sales as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on 2020 franchise sales.
(2)Includes a $3.1 million benefit in 2021 from the recognition of recoverable Program of Social Integration (“PIS”) and Contribution for the Financing of Social Security (“COFINS”) taxes in connection with favorable court rulings in Brazil regarding the calculation methodology and taxable base. The amount recognized as a result of the favorable court rulings primarily represents refundable PIS and COFINS taxes for prior years, including accrued interest, and will be recovered by offsetting future PIS and COFINS taxes due.
Franchisee Deferred Payment Agreement - On December 27, 2020, we entered into the Resolution Agreement with Out West, who currently franchises approximately 80 Outback Steakhouse restaurants in the western United States, primarily in California. Under the terms of the Resolution Agreement, we agreed to permanently waive all past due royalties and advertising fees for the period of February 24, 2020 to July 26, 2020 and defer, among other items, all past due royalties and advertising fees for the period of July 27, 2020 to November 22, 2020 due to the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Out West’s business. See Note 4 - Revenue Recognition of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the Resolution Agreement.
During 2021, Out West franchise revenues recovered, approaching historical levels. Following is a summary of franchise and other revenues and comparable restaurant sales for Out West franchised locations for the periods indicated:
____________________
(1)Franchise and other revenues during 2020 were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. During 2021, we collected Out West monthly royalty and advertising fees, and $5.1 million of past due amounts deferred under the Resolution Agreement.
COSTS AND EXPENSES
Food and beverage costs
Food and beverage costs decreased as a percentage of Restaurant sales in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to: (i) 0.9% from increases in average check per person, primarily driven by reduced discounting and an increase in menu pricing, (ii) 0.4% from the impact of certain cost savings initiatives and (iii) 0.3% from inventory obsolescence and spoilage costs during 2020 associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by an increase as a percentage of Restaurant sales of 0.6% from commodity inflation.
BLOOMIN’ BRANDS, INC.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued
In 2022, we anticipate approximately 11.0% to 13.0% commodity inflation, with approximately 70% of our estimated annual food purchases currently covered by fixed contracts and the remainder subject to floating market prices.
Labor and other related expenses
Labor and other related expenses include all direct and indirect labor costs incurred in operations, including distribution expense to Restaurant Managing Partners and other field incentive compensation expenses. Labor and other related expenses decreased as a percentage of Restaurant sales in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to 4.1% from leveraging increased restaurant sales and 0.8% from the 2020 impact of net relief pay. These decreases were partially offset by increases as a percentage of Restaurant sales of 0.8% from wage rate increases and 0.4% from higher management bonus.
In 2022, we anticipate high-single digit labor cost inflation.
Other restaurant operating expenses
In August 2021, we entered into the Royalty Termination Agreement with the Carrabba’s Founders for $61.9 million in cash. See Note 22 - Commitments and Contingencies for additional details. We recorded Carrabba’s Italian Grill royalty expense of $3.0 million and $3.8 million during fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Other restaurant operating expenses include certain unit-level operating costs such as operating supplies, rent, repairs and maintenance, advertising expenses, utilities, pre-opening costs and other occupancy costs. A substantial portion of these expenses is fixed or indirectly variable. Other restaurant operating expenses decreased as a percentage of Restaurant sales in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to: (i) 3.2% from leveraging increased restaurant sales, (ii) 1.0% from lower advertising expense and (iii) 0.3% from a decrease in off-premises related costs. These decreases were partially offset by increases as a percentage of Restaurant sales of 1.5% from the Carrabba’s Italian Grill royalty termination payment and 0.8% from higher utilities, operating and rent expense.
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to a decreased level of capital expenditures since 2018, as compared to historical levels, and asset impairments during 2020.
BLOOMIN’ BRANDS, INC.

General and administrative
General and administrative expense includes salaries and benefits, management incentive programs, related payroll tax and benefits, other employee-related costs and professional services. Following is a summary of the change in General and administrative expense for the period indicated:
Provision for impaired assets and restaurant closings
During 2020, we recognized asset impairment and closure charges of $66.5 million and $3.6 million within the U.S. and international segments, respectively, primarily related to the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19-related pre-tax asset impairments and closure costs include $23.8 million in connection with the closure of 22 U.S. restaurants and from the update of certain cash flow assumptions, including lease renewal considerations. During 2020, we also recognized asset impairment charges related to transformational initiatives of $6.3 million, which were not allocated to our operating segments. See Note 5 - Impairments, Exit Costs and Disposals of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
The impairment and closure charges during 2021 resulted primarily from locations identified for closure or relocation.
Income (loss) from operations
Income from operations during 2021 as compared to Loss from operations during 2020 was primarily due to: (i) higher comparable restaurant sales and franchise revenues, (ii) COVID-19 pandemic related charges and the impact of transformational and restructuring initiatives during 2020, (iii) lower advertising expense, (iv) the 2020 impact of net relief pay, (v) lower depreciation and amortization expense and (vi) the impact of certain cost savings initiatives. These increases were partially offset by: (i) the Carrabba’s Italian Grill royalty termination payment, (ii) higher labor costs and commodity inflation, (iii) an increase in incentive compensation and management bonus and (iv) higher utilities and operating expense.
BLOOMIN’ BRANDS, INC.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued
Interest expense, net
The decrease in Interest expense, net during 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily due to: (i) lower revolver and term loan borrowings, (ii) the discontinuance of debt discount amortization related to our 2025 Notes resulting from the modified retrospective adoption of a new accounting standard during 2021 and (iii) lower interest rates on our unhedged variable rate debt. These decreases were partially offset by increases in interest expense from our 2029 Notes issued in April 2021 and our 2025 Notes issued in May 2020.
Provision (benefit) for income taxes
The net decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily due to the benefit of FICA tax credits on certain employees’ tips reducing the effective income tax rate in 2021 as a result of pre-tax book income as compared to increasing the effective income tax rate in 2020 as a result of pre-tax book loss.
We have a blended federal and state statutory rate of approximately 26%. The effective income tax rate was lower in 2021 and higher in 2020 than the blended federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of tax credits for FICA taxes on certain employees’ tips.
Segments
We consider our restaurant concepts and international markets as operating segments, which reflects how we manage our business, review operating performance and allocate resources. Resources are allocated and performance is assessed by our Chief Executive Officer, whom we have determined to be our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). We aggregate our operating segments into two reportable segments, U.S. and international. The U.S. segment includes all restaurants operating in the U.S. while restaurants operating outside the U.S. are included in the international segment.
Revenues for both segments include only transactions with customers and exclude intersegment revenues. Excluded from Income (loss) from operations for U.S. and international are certain legal and corporate costs not directly related to the performance of the segments, most stock-based compensation expenses and certain bonus expenses.
During 2020, we recorded $32.4 million of pre-tax charges as a part of transformational initiatives. These costs were primarily recorded within General and administrative expense and Provision for impaired assets and restaurant closings and were not allocated to our segments since our CODM does not consider the impact of transformational initiatives when assessing segment performance.
Refer to Note 23 - Segment Reporting of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for reconciliations of segment income (loss) from operations to the consolidated operating results.

____________________
(1)Summation of quarterly changes for restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales will not total to annual amounts as the restaurants that meet the definition of a comparable restaurant will differ each period based on when the restaurant opened.
The increase in U.S. Restaurant sales in 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily due to: (i) higher comparable restaurant sales from recovery of in-restaurant dining from the significantly reduced levels in 2020 after the onset of the pandemic and strong retention of off-premises sales and (ii) the opening of 15 new restaurants not included in our comparable restaurant sales base. These increases were partially offset by the closure of 45 restaurants since December 29, 2019.
Income (loss) from operations
U.S. Income from operations generated during 2021 as compared to Loss from operations during 2020 was primarily due to: (i) higher comparable restaurant sales and franchise revenues, (ii) COVID-19 pandemic related charges during 2020, (iii) the 2020 impact of net relief pay, (iv) lower advertising expense, (v) lower delivery-related costs and (vi) the impact of certain cost savings initiatives. These increases were partially offset by: (i) the Carrabba’s Italian Grill royalty termination payment, (ii) higher labor costs and commodity inflation, (iii) higher utilities and operating expense and (iv) higher management bonus.

(1)Summation of quarterly changes for restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales will not total to annual amounts as the restaurants that meet the definition of a comparable restaurant will differ each period based on when the restaurant opened.
The increase in international Restaurant sales in 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily due to: (i) higher comparable restaurant sales principally attributable to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fiscal year 2020 international Restaurant sales and (ii) the opening of 33 new restaurants not included in our comparable restaurant sales base. These increases were partially offset by the effect of foreign currency translation of the Brazil Real relative to the U.S. dollar.
Income (loss) from operations
International Income from operations generated during 2021 as compared to Loss from operations during 2020 was primarily due to higher restaurant sales due to the reopening of restaurant dining rooms and increases in average check per person. These increases were partially offset by: (i) additional utilities, rent and operating expense, (ii) commodity inflation and (iii) higher labor costs.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we provide certain non-GAAP measures, which present operating results on an adjusted basis. These are supplemental measures of performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the following: (i) system-wide sales, (ii) Adjusted restaurant-level operating margins, (iii) Adjusted income (loss) from operations and the corresponding margins, (iv) Adjusted net income (loss) and (v) Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share.
BLOOMIN’ BRANDS, INC.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued
We believe that our use of non-GAAP financial measures permits investors to assess the operating performance of our business relative to our performance based on U.S. GAAP results and relative to other companies within the restaurant industry by isolating the effects of certain items that may vary from period to period without correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. However, our inclusion of these adjusted measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or infrequent items or that the items for which we have made adjustments are unusual or infrequent or will not recur. We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors as they form part of the basis for how our management team and our Board evaluate our operating performance, allocate resources and establish employee incentive plans.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace U.S. GAAP financial measures, and they are not necessarily standardized or comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. We maintain internal guidelines with respect to the types of adjustments we include in our non-GAAP measures. These guidelines endeavor to differentiate between types of gains and expenses that are reflective of our core operations in a period, and those that may vary from period to period without correlation to our core performance in that period. However, implementation of these guidelines necessarily involves the application of judgment, and the treatment of any items not directly addressed by, or changes to, our guidelines will be considered by our disclosure committee. Refer to the reconciliations of non-GAAP measures for descriptions of the actual adjustments made in the current period and the corresponding prior period.
System-Wide Sales - System-wide sales is a non-GAAP financial measure that includes sales of all restaurants operating under our brand names, whether we own them or not. Management uses this information to make decisions about future plans for the development of additional restaurants and new concepts, as well as evaluation of current operations. System-wide sales comprise sales of Company-owned and franchised restaurants. For a summary of sales of Company-owned restaurants, refer to Note 4 - Revenue Recognition of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The following table provides a summary of sales of franchised restaurants for the periods indicated, which are not included in our consolidated financial results. Franchise sales within this table do not represent our sales and are presented only as an indicator of changes in the restaurant system, which management believes is important information regarding the health of our restaurant concepts and in determining our royalties and/or service fees.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and Cash Equivalents
As of December 26, 2021, we had $87.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $26.6 million was held by foreign affiliates. The international jurisdictions in which we have significant cash do not have any known restrictions that would prohibit repatriation.
As of December 26, 2021, we had aggregate accumulated foreign earnings of approximately $28.8 million. This amount consisted primarily of historical earnings from 2017 and prior that were previously taxed in the U.S. under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and post-2017 foreign earnings, which we may repatriate to the U.S. without additional material U.S. federal income tax. These amounts are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries. See Note 21 - Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our indefinite reinvestment assertion.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued
As of December 26, 2021, we had $699.3 million in available unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, net of letters of credit of $20.7 million.
2029 Notes - On April 16, 2021, we issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2029. The 2029 Notes mature on April 15, 2029, unless earlier redeemed or purchased by us. The 2029 Notes bear cash interest at an annual rate of 5.125% payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year.
The net proceeds from the 2029 Notes were approximately $294.5 million, after deducting the initial purchaser’s discount and our offering expenses. The net proceeds were used to repay a portion of our outstanding Term loan A and revolving credit facility in conjunction with the refinancing of our Former Credit Facility.
Credit Agreement - On April 16, 2021, we and OSI, as co-borrowers, entered into the Credit Agreement, which provides for senior secured financing of up to $1.0 billion consisting of a $200.0 million Term loan A and an $800.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Senior Secured Credit Facility”). The Senior Secured Credit Facility matures on April 16, 2026 and replaced our prior senior secured financing of up to $1.5 billion (the “Former Credit Facility”).
Our Senior Secured Credit Facility contains mandatory prepayment requirements for Term loan A, including the requirement that we prepay outstanding amounts under these loans with 50% of our annual excess cash flow, as defined in the Credit Agreement, commencing with the fiscal year ending December 25, 2022. The amount of outstanding loans required to be prepaid in accordance with the debt covenants may vary based on our Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio and year end results. Other than the annual required minimum amortization premiums of $10.0 million, we do not anticipate any other payments will be required through December 25, 2022.
See Note 13 - Long-term Debt, Net for additional details regarding the 2029 Notes and Credit Agreement.
As of December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020, we were in compliance with our debt covenants. We believe that we will remain in compliance with our debt covenants during the next 12 months.
Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk - In October 2018, we entered into variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements with 12 counterparties to hedge a portion of the cash flows of our variable rate debt. The swap agreements have an aggregate notional amount of $550.0 million and mature on November 30, 2022. We pay a weighted average fixed rate of 3.04% on the notional amount and receive payments from the counterparties based on the one-month London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) rate. See Note 17 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
In connection with the refinancing of the Former Credit Facility, on April 16, 2021 we terminated our variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements with seven counterparties having an aggregate notional amount of $275.0 million for a payment of approximately $13.3 million, including accrued interest. Following these terminations, $13.4 million of unrealized losses related to the terminated swap agreements included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (“AOCL”) will be amortized on a straight-line basis to Interest expense, net over the remaining original term of the terminated swaps.
As a result of our anticipated decrease in variable rate debt balances due to significant voluntary debt payments, on December 9, 2021 we terminated our variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements with three counterparties having an aggregate notional amount of $150.0 million for a payment of approximately $4.1 million, including accrued interest. Following these terminations, $4.1 million of unrealized losses related to the terminated swap agreements included in AOCL will be amortized to Interest expense, net during 2022.

Use of Cash
Cash flows generated from operating activities and availability under our revolving credit facility are our principal sources of liquidity, which we use for operating expenses, debt payments, share repurchases and dividend payments, development of new restaurants, remodeling or relocating older restaurants and investment in technology.
We believe that our expected liquidity sources are adequate to fund debt service requirements, lease obligations, capital expenditures and working capital obligations during the 12 months following this filing. However, our ability to continue to meet these requirements and obligations will depend on, among other things, our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenue and cash flow and our ability to manage costs and working capital successfully.
Capital Expenditures - We estimate that our capital expenditures will total approximately $225 million to $240 million in 2022. The amount of actual capital expenditures may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things, including raw material constraints.
Material Cash Requirements - The following table presents current and long-term material cash requirements as of December 26, 2021:
____________________
(1)Amounts represent undiscounted future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases. Includes $1.0 billion related to lease renewal options that are reasonably certain of exercise.
(2)Includes Senior Secured Credit Facility, 2029 Notes, 2025 Notes and finance lease obligations. Amount is not reduced by unamortized debt issuance costs and finance lease interest totaling $14.3 million.
(3)Projected future interest payments on long-term debt are based on interest rates in effect as of December 26, 2021 and assume only scheduled principal payments. Estimated interest expense includes the impact of remaining variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements.
(4)Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. We have purchase obligations with various vendors that consist primarily of inventory, technology, restaurant-level service contracts and advertising.
(5)Includes other long-term liabilities, primarily consisting of deferred compensation obligations, deposits and other accrued obligations. Unrecognized tax benefits are excluded from this table since it is not possible to estimate when these future payments will occur.
Dividends and Share Repurchases - In April 2021, we entered into our Credit Agreement, the terms of which contained certain restrictions on cash dividends and share repurchases until after September 26, 2021 and we were compliant with our financial covenants. We were compliant with our financial covenants as of December 26, 2021 and we believe that we will remain in compliance with our debt covenants during the next 12 months. As such, absent unanticipated circumstances, we do not believe that compliance with our financial covenants will materially limit our ability to pay dividends in the near term and future dividend payments will depend on various other factors considered by our Board as noted below.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued
During the first quarter of 2020, we declared and paid dividends of $0.20 per share. We did not pay dividends during 2021. In February 2022, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per share, payable on March 16, 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 2, 2022.
We did not repurchase any shares of our outstanding common stock during 2021. On February 8, 2022, our Board approved the 2022 Share Repurchase Program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $125.0 million of our outstanding common stock. The 2022 Share Repurchase Program will expire on August 9, 2023.
Following is a summary of our former share repurchase programs as of December 26, 2021 (dollars in thousands):
The following table presents our dividends and share repurchases for the periods indicated:
Our ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases is dependent on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, continued compliance with the financial covenants in our debt agreements and the existence of surplus, as well as our earnings, financial condition, capital expenditure requirements and other factors that our Board deems relevant.
Lease Guarantees - We guarantee certain lease agreements primarily related to divested restaurant properties in circumstances where we have assigned our lease interest. In the event of non-payment by the primary lessees, we may be required to satisfy these lease agreements with cash. See Note 22 - Commitments and Contingencies for additional details regarding our lease guarantees.
Deferred Compensation Programs - Certain Restaurant Managing Partners and Chef Partners in the U.S. (“U.S. Partners”) participate in deferred compensation programs that are subject to the rules of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The deferred compensation obligations due under these plans was $15.5 million and $28.1 million as of December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020, respectively. We invest in various corporate-owned life insurance policies, which are held within an irrevocable grantor or rabbi trust account for settlement of our obligations under the deferred compensation plans. The obligation for U.S. Partners’ deferred compensation was fully funded as of December 26, 2021.

Summary of Cash Flows and Financial Condition
Cash Flows -The following table presents a summary of our cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated:
Operating activities - Net cash provided by operating activities increased during 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to a significant improvement in revenues and operating results, partially offset by: (i) cash paid in connection with the Carrabba’s Italian Grill royalty termination, (ii) timing of collections of gift card receivables, (iii) higher inventory purchases, (iv) payment of payroll taxes deferred in 2020 as a result of the Coronavirus, Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, (v) cash paid to terminate interest rate swap agreements and (vi) timing of operational payments and receipts.
Investing activities - The increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily due to higher capital expenditures, partially offset by higher proceeds from the disposal of property, fixtures and equipment.
Financing activities - The increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily due to our capital restructuring and debt payments throughout the fiscal year that lowered bank debt and unsecured notes by an aggregate of $297.0 million.
Financial Condition - Following is a summary of our current assets, current liabilities and working capital (deficit) as of the periods indicated:
Working capital (deficit) includes: (i) Unearned revenue primarily from unredeemed gift cards of $398.8 million and $381.6 million as of December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020, respectively, and (ii) current operating lease liabilities of $177.0 million and $176.8 million as of December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020, respectively, with the corresponding operating right-of-use assets recorded as non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have, and in the future may continue to have, negative working capital balances (as is common for many restaurant companies). We operate successfully with negative working capital because cash collected on restaurant sales are typically received before payment is due on our current liabilities, and our inventory turnover rates require relatively low investment in inventories. Additionally, ongoing cash flows from restaurant operations and gift card sales are typically used to service debt obligations and to make capital expenditures.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these accompanying consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made and changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets - Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. For long-lived assets deployed at our restaurants, we review for impairment at the individual restaurant level.
When evaluating for impairment, the total future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets are compared to the carrying amount. If the total future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying amount, this may be an indicator of impairment. An impairment loss is recognized in earnings when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Fair value is generally estimated using a discounted cash flow model. The key estimates and assumptions used in this model are future cash flow estimates, with material changes generally driven by changes in expected use, and the discount rate. These estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in our operating performance. Historically, the change in useful lives of our assets as a result of planned closures or the decision not to renew leases has been a key factor in the impairment we have recognized.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets - Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually in the second fiscal quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
We may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. In considering the qualitative approach, we evaluate factors including, but not limited to, macro-economic conditions, market and industry conditions, commodity cost fluctuations, competitive environment, share price performance, results of prior impairment tests, operational stability and the overall financial performance of the reporting units.
If the qualitative assessment is not performed or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated. Fair value of a reporting unit is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is estimated by utilizing a weighted average of the income approach, using a discounted cash flow model, and, when appropriate, the market approach including the guideline public company method and guideline transaction method. The key estimates and assumptions used in these models are future cash flow estimates, which are heavily influenced by revenue growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures. These estimates are subjective, and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies. The fair value of the trade names is determined through a relief from royalty method.
BLOOMIN’ BRANDS, INC.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued
The carrying value of the reporting unit or trade name is compared to its estimated fair value, with any excess of carrying value over fair value deemed to be an indicator of impairment.
The carrying value of goodwill as of December 26, 2021 was $268.4 million. We performed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of 2021 by utilizing the qualitative approach and determined that there were no events or circumstances to indicate that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units was less than their carrying values.
Sales declines at our restaurants, unplanned increases in commodity or labor costs, deterioration in overall economic conditions and challenges in the restaurant industry may result in future impairment charges. It is possible that changes in circumstances or changes in our judgments, assumptions and estimates could result in an impairment charge of a portion or all of our goodwill or other intangible assets.
Leases - We use judgment to determine the reasonably certain lease term, which in turn, impacts the applicable incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”) used to calculate the initial lease liability for each portfolio of leases. Other assumptions used in determining our incremental borrowing rate include our implied credit rating and an estimate of secured borrowing rates based on comparable market data. We determined the present value of the lease liabilities by using a country specific IBR and applying a single rate to the respective portfolio of leases based on term, regardless of the underlying asset type.
The reasonably certain lease term used in the evaluation of existing leases at transition and new leases after adoption of the new lease standard includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option is reasonably certain because failure to exercise such an option would result in an economic penalty. Such an economic penalty would typically result from having to abandon a building or equipment with remaining economic value upon vacating a property.
We use our estimated IBR, which is derived from information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of lease payments. We give consideration to market data as well as publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating our IBR.
At the inception of each lease, we evaluate the property and the lease to determine whether the lease is an operating lease or a financing lease. This lease accounting evaluation may require significant judgment in determining the fair value and useful life of the leased property and the appropriate reasonably certain lease term. These judgments may produce materially different amounts of rent expense in a given reporting period than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used.
Insurance Reserves - We carry insurance programs with specific retention levels or high per-claim deductibles for a significant portion of expected losses under our workers’ compensation, general or liquor liability, health, property and management liability insurance programs. For some programs, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure relating to certain risks.
We record a liability for all unresolved claims and for an estimate of incurred but not reported claims at the anticipated cost that falls below our specified retention levels or per-claim deductible amounts. Our liability for insurance claims was $53.5 million and $52.8 million as of December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020, respectively. In establishing our reserves, we consider certain actuarial assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions, and the frequency and severity of claims. The establishment of the reserves utilizing such estimates and assumptions is in part based on the premise that historical claims experience is indicative of current or future expected activity, which could differ significantly. Reserves recorded for workers’ compensation and general or liquor liability claims are discounted using the average of the one-year and five-year risk-free rate of monetary assets that have comparable maturities.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued
If actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 50 basis point change in the discount rate in our insurance claim liabilities as of December 26, 2021, would have affected net earnings by $0.8 million in 2021.
Income Taxes - Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates, based on certain judgments regarding enacted tax laws and published guidance, in effect in the years in which we expect those temporary differences to reverse. As of December 26, 2021, tax loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards that do not have a valuation allowance are expected to be recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration periods. We currently expect to utilize general business tax credit carryforwards within a 10-year period. However, our ability to utilize these tax credits could be adversely impacted by, among other items, a future “ownership change” as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. A valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred taxes may not be realized. Changes in assumptions regarding our level and composition of earnings, tax laws or the deferred tax valuation allowance and the results of tax audits, may materially impact the effective income tax rate.
While we consider all of our tax positions to be fully supportable, our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by U.S. and foreign tax authorities. In determining taxable income, income or loss before taxes is adjusted for differences between local tax laws and generally accepted accounting principles. A tax benefit from an uncertain position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we recognize a liability. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits requires significant management judgment regarding exposures about our various tax positions. These assumptions and probabilities are reviewed and updated based upon new information. An unfavorable tax settlement could require the use of cash and an increase in the amount of income tax expense we recognize. As of December 26, 2021, we had $18.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest and penalties, that if recognized, would impact our effective income tax rate.
