Significant Acquisitions
On June 24, 2020, we domesticated into a Delaware corporation and changed our name from “Act II Global Acquisition Corp.” to “Whole Earth Brands, Inc.” On June 25, 2020, we consummated the Business Combination of (i) all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Merisant Company, Merisant Luxembourg Sarl (“Merisant Luxembourg”), Mafco Worldwide LLC, Mafco Shanghai LLC (“Mafco Shanghai”), EVD Holdings LLC (“EVD Holdings”), and Mafco Deutschland GmbH (together with Merisant Company, Merisant Luxembourg, Mafco Worldwide LLC, Mafco Shanghai, and EVD Holdings, and their respective direct and indirect subsidiaries, “Merisant and Mafco Worldwide”), and (ii) certain assets and liabilities of Merisant and Mafco Worldwide included in the Transferred Assets and Liabilities (as defined in the Purchase Agreement (as hereafter defined)), from Flavors Holdings Inc. (“Flavors Holdings”), MW Holdings I LLC (“MW Holdings I”), MW Holdings III LLC (“MW Holdings III”), and Mafco Foreign Holdings, Inc. (“Mafco Foreign Holdings,”) and together with Flavors Holdings, MW Holdings I, and MW Holdings III, the “Sellers”), pursuant to that certain Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) entered into with the Sellers dated as of December 19, 2019, as amended.
As a result of the Business Combination, Act II was deemed to be the acquirer for accounting purposes, and Merisant and MAFCO, which is the business conducted prior to the closing of the Business Combination, was deemed to be the acquiree and accounting Predecessor. The Business Combination was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting, and the Successor’s financial statements reflect a new basis of accounting that is based on the fair value of net assets acquired. As a result of the application of the acquisition method of accounting as of the effective time of the Business Combination, the financial statements for the Predecessor Period and for the Successor Period are presented on different bases. The historical financial information of Act II prior to the Business Combination has not been reflected in the Predecessor Period financial statements.
On November 10, 2020, we executed and closed the Swerve Purchase Agreement. Swerve is a manufacturer and marketer of a portfolio of zero sugar, keto-friendly, and plant-based sweeteners and baking mixes. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Swerve Purchase Agreement, at the closing we purchased all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of both Swerve LLC and Swerve IP from RF Development, and both Swerve LLC and Swerve IP became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Whole Earth Brands. The transaction was structured to simultaneously sign and close and was not subject to any closing conditions.
Pursuant to the terms of the Swerve Purchase Agreement, we paid RF Development $80 million in cash for all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of both Swerve LLC and Swerve IP, which was subject to customary post-closing adjustments.
To finance a portion of the Swerve transaction, we utilized approximately $47.9 million under our $50 million revolving loan facility with Toronto Dominion (Texas) LLC.
On December 17, 2020, we entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Wholesome Purchase Agreement”) with WSO Investments, Inc. (“WSO Investments” and together with its subsidiaries “Wholesome”), WSO Holdings, LP (“WSO Partnership”), Edwards Billington and Son, Limited (“EBS”), WSO Holdings, LLC (“WSO LLC,” and together with WSO Partnership and EBS, the “WSO Sellers”), and WSO Partnership, in its capacity as representative for the WSO Sellers. WSO Investments is the direct parent of its wholly-owned subsidiary Wholesome Sweeteners, Incorporated, which was formed to import, market, distribute, and sell organic sugars, unrefined specialty sugars, and related products.
On February 5, 2021, pursuant to the terms of the Wholesome Purchase Agreement, (i) we purchased and acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of WSO Investments from the WSO Sellers, for (x) an initial cash purchase price of $180 million (subject to customary post-closing adjustments), plus (y) as more thoroughly described below, up to an additional $55 million (the “Earn-Out Amount”) upon the satisfaction of certain post-closing financial metrics by Wholesome; and (ii) WSO Investments became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the “Wholesome Transaction”). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Wholesome Purchase Agreement, and as more thoroughly described therein, payment of the Earn-Out Amount, in whole or in part, was subject to Wholesome achieving certain EBITDA thresholds at or above approximately $30 million during the period beginning August 29, 2020, and ending December 31, 2021 (the “Earn-Out Period”). A portion of the Earn-Out Amount (up to $27.5 million) could be paid, at our election, in freely tradeable, registered shares of Company common stock calculated using the 20-day volume weighted average trading price per share as of the date of determination. Calculation of the achievement of the Earn-Out Amount is subject to certain adjustments more thoroughly described in the Wholesome Purchase Agreement.
Following the completion of the Earn-Out Period, we determined, in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement, that the sellers were entitled to receive the Earn-Out Amount in full. We elected to satisfy part of the Earn-Out Amount in common stock and on February 23, 2022, issued 2,659,574 shares of the Company’s common stock. The remaining $30 million portion of the $55 million Earn-Out Amount was paid in cash which was funded from available capacity under our revolving credit facility.
In connection with the closing of the Wholesome Transaction, on February 5, 2021, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into an amendment and restatement agreement (the “Amendment Agreement”) with Toronto Dominion (Texas) LLC, as administrative agent, and certain lenders signatory thereto, which amended and restated its existing senior secured loan agreement dated as of June 25, 2020 (as amended on September 4, 2020, the “Existing Credit Agreement,” and as further amended by the Amendment Agreement, the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”), by and among Toronto Dominion (Texas) LLC, as administrative agent, certain lenders signatory thereto and certain other parties. See Note 7 to our audited consolidated and combined financial statements for further description of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.
Covid-19 Impact
COVID-19 surfaced in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and has since spread throughout the rest of the world. In March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national emergency by the U.S. Government. The pandemic has negatively affected the U.S. and global economies, disrupted global supply chains and financial markets, and resulted in significant travel restrictions, including mandated facility closures and shelter-in-place orders.
We have taken measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and implemented work from home arrangements, where possible, social distancing where working from home is not feasible, including in our manufacturing facilities, deep cleaning protocols at all of our facilities and travel restrictions, among other measures. We have also taken appropriate measures to work with our customers to minimize potential disruption and to support the communities that we serve to address the challenges posed by the pandemic.
While we have experienced a net increase in the overall demand for our products, we are unable to fully determine the future impact of COVID-19 on demand for our products or our ability to supply our products. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic and related containment and mitigation actions taken by national, state and local government officials across the world to prevent disease spread. While vaccines to prevent COVID-19 were approved by health agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate and began to be administered near the end of calendar year 2020, distribution of the vaccines globally is taking longer than anticipated, and where vaccines are available, the public’s willingness to get inoculated has lagged. In addition, new strains of the virus appear to have increased transmissibility, including, in some limited cases, among those who are vaccinated. The extent of the pandemic’s impact on us will also depend upon our employees’ ability to work safely in our facilities, our customers’ ability to continue to operate or receive our products, the ability of our suppliers to continue to operate, and the level of activity and demand for the ultimate product and services of our customers or their customers.
Results of Operations
Consolidated
(In thousands of dollars)
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020

Product revenues, net increased $218.5 million, or 79.3%, due to a $211.6 million increase in product revenues at Branded CPG and a $6.9 million increase in product revenues at Flavors & Ingredients.

Cost of goods sold increased $156.0 million, or 87.1%, primarily driven by $154.2 million from the acquisitions of Wholesome and Swerve (which includes $1.6 million of purchase accounting adjustments related to inventory), additional costs associated with new production operations of $7.9 million, increased sales volume and mix and a $1.0 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by a $17.6 million favorable change in purchase accounting adjustments related to inventory revaluation adjustments from the Business Combination (benefit of $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to expense of $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020).

Amortization of intangible assets for the combined year ended December 31, 2020 was $10.9 million, including $6.0 million for the period from June 26, 2020 through December 31, 2020 and $4.9 million from January 1, 2020 through June 25, 2020. Amortization of intangible assets increased $7.3 million, or 67.1%, primarily due to amortization expense related to the intangible assets acquired as part of the Wholesome and Swerve acquisitions.
Asset impairment charges. There were no asset impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2021. Asset impairment charges were $40.6 million in the Predecessor period and for the combined year ended December 31, 2020 and included an impairment charge of $22.9 million related to indefinite-lived intangible assets and a goodwill impairment charge of $17.7 million.

Other income (expense), net for the combined year ended December 31, 2020 was income of $0.2 million, including expense of $0.6 million for the period from June 26, 2020 through December 31, 2020 and income of $0.8 million from January 1, 2020 through June 25, 2020.

The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 101.2%. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal rate of 21% primarily due to state and local taxes, non-deductible expenses including executive compensation, stock-based compensation and transaction related costs coupled with the finalization of the Switzerland tax ruling, changes in U.K. tax laws and the reversal of uncertain tax liabilities as a result of the lapse of applicable statute of limitations.
The effective tax rate for the Successor period from June 26, 2020 through December 31, 2020 was 23.7%. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal rate of 21% primarily due to the U.S. tax effect of international operations, state and local taxes and tax rate differences related to our foreign operations. The effective rate for the Predecessor period from January 1, 2020 to June 25, 2020 was 9.3% and differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the impairment of non-deductible goodwill, the U.S. effect of foreign operations and a decrease in our uncertain tax position liability.

Product revenues, net. Product revenues, net were $147.2 million for the period from June 26, 2020 through December 31, 2020 and $128.3 million from January 1, 2020 through June 25, 2020.

This increase was driven by $12.1 million of purchase accounting adjustments related to inventory, $3.3 million from the acquisition of Swerve (which includes $0.5 million of purchase accounting adjustments related to inventory) and higher volumes in the Branded CPG segment, partially offset by lower volumes in the Flavors & Ingredients segment.

Other income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net was expense of $0.6 million for the period from June 26, 2020 through December 31, 2020 and income of $0.8 million from January 1, 2020 through June 25, 2020.

The effective tax rate for the Successor period from June 26, 2020 through December 31, 2020 was 23.7%.

The effective rate for the Predecessor period from January 1, 2020 to June 25, 2020 was 9.3% and differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the impairment of non-deductible goodwill, the U.S. effect of foreign operations and a decrease in our uncertain tax position liability.
The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was an income tax benefit of 8.7% which differs from the statutory federal rate of 21% primarily due to the U.S. tax effect of international operations and state and local taxes.

Product revenues, net for Flavors & Ingredients were $50.3 million for the period from June 26, 2020 through December 31, 2020 and $47.6 million from January 1, 2020 through June 25, 2020. Product revenues, net for Flavors & Ingredients for the combined year ended December 31, 2020 were $97.9 million, a decrease of $8.4 million, or 7.9%, from $106.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by a $9.6 million decline in international tobacco revenues as well as some revenue decline due to the effects of COVID-19, partially offset by growth in the remainder of the licorice derivatives business.
Segment operating income (loss). Operating loss for Flavors & Ingredients was $2.6 million for the period from June 26, 2020 through December 31, 2020 and $23.7 million from January 1, 2020 through June 25, 2020. Operating loss for Flavors & Ingredients for the combined year ended December 31, 2020 was $26.4 million, a decrease of $45.8 million as compared to operating income of $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decline was primarily due to asset impairment charges totaling $29.5 million recorded during the Predecessor Period in the first quarter of 2020, $8.6 million of purchase accounting adjustments related to inventory, $2.7 million of higher amortization expense due to purchase accounting valuations, Predecessor contracted transaction bonuses and related payroll taxes of $4.2 million in 2020, and lower revenues, partially offset by a $1.3 million decline in bonus expense.
Corporate
Beginning with the first quarter of 2021, the Company’s corporate office functions are now reported and included under Corporate. Corporate is not a reportable or operating segment.
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020
Operating loss. Operating loss for Corporate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $34.0 million. Operating loss for the combined year ended December 31, 2020 was $26.3 million, including $16.9 million for the period from June 26, 2020 through December 31, 2020 and $9.4 million from January 1, 2020 through June 25, 2020. Operating loss rose $7.6 million, or 29.0%, primarily due to a $3.3 million increase in acquisition related transaction expenses, a $3.1 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, a $2.6 million increase in insurance expense and higher salaries due to new hires and the full year impact of 2020 hires to operate as a public company, partially offset by $2.6 million of lower bonus expense as 2020 included $4.8 million of transaction bonuses.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Operating loss. Operating loss for Corporate was $16.9 million for the period from June 26, 2020 through December 31, 2020 and $9.4 million for the period from January 1, 2020 through June 25, 2020. Operating loss for Corporate for the combined year ended December 31, 2020 was $26.3 million, an increase of $16.8 million compared to an operating loss of $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to Predecessor contracted transaction bonuses and related payroll taxes of $4.8 million, $5.1 million of acquisition related transaction costs and increased staffing and other costs to support operating as a public company.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have historically funded operations with cash flow from operations and, when needed, with borrowings, which are described below.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $28.3 million. Our principal source of liquidity is our cash from operations. We also have access to credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes, including our revolving credit facility. We believe our sources of liquidity and capital, and our credit facilities will be sufficient to finance our continued operations, growth strategy and additional expenses we expect to incur for at least the next twelve months. Overall, we do not anticipate negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity. However, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and other recent global events, if a serious economic crisis ensues, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.
The following table shows summary cash flow information for the year ended December 31, 2021, the periods from June 26, 2020 through December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2020 through June 25, 2020, and the year ended December 31, 2019 (in thousands):
Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net cash provided by operating activities for the combined year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $10.5 million, including net cash used in operating activities of $9.4 million in the period from June 26, 2020 through December 31, 2020 and net cash provided by operating activities of $19.9 million in the period from January 1, 2020 through June 25, 2020. The decrease of $1.0 million was primarily attributable to higher cash paid for interest and unfavorable working capital changes, largely offset by higher cash generated from operations. Cash paid for interest for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $21.2 million compared to $4.1 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2020. Cash paid for income taxes, net of income tax refunds, was $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $5.3 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2020.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $10.5 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $21.2 million compared to $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower cash flows from operating results, unfavorable working capital changes and higher interest payments.
Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $197.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which included cash paid of $191.2 million, net of cash acquired, related to the acquisition of Wholesome, $1.0 million of cash received for the final working capital settlement related to the acquisition of Swerve, capital expenditures of $12.2 million and proceeds from the sale of one of our facilities of $4.5 million.
Net cash used in investing activities was $282.1 million in the period from June 26, 2020 through December 31, 2020, which included cash paid of $376.7 million, net of cash acquired, related to the Business Combination, $178.9 million of cash transferred from the trust account, $79.8 million related to the Swerve acquisition and capital expenditures of $4.5 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $3.5 million from January 1, 2020 through June 25, 2020 and $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and was entirely related to capital expenditures in both periods.
We expect 2022 capital expenditures to be approximately $10.0 million which includes manufacturing equipment at our production facilities and information technology expenditures.
Financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $199.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and reflects $400 million of proceeds from the Credit Facilities (as defined and described below), repayment of the revolving credit facility of $47.9 million, repayments of long-term debt of $139.3 million, payments of debt issuance costs of $11.6 million and payments of $1.9 million for tax withholdings related to net share settlements of share-based awards.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $252.2 million in the period from June 26, 2020 through December 31, 2020 and reflects $140.0 million of proceeds from the Loan Agreement (as defined and described below), net of debt issuance costs of $7.1 million, proceeds from the revolving credit facility of $47.9 million, proceeds from the sale of common stock and warrants of $75.0 million and repayments of long-term debt of $3.5 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $16.9 million from January 1, 2020 through June 25, 2020 due to $8.5 million of repayments, offset by $3.5 million of borrowings related to the prior revolving credit facility and $11.9 million due to funding to the parent.
Net cash used in financing activities was $23.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 due to funding to the parent of $25.4 million, partially offset by $1.5 million of proceeds from a revolving credit facility.
Debt
On December 31, 2020, the Company’s senior secured loan agreement consisted of a senior secured first lien term loan facility of $140 million and a first lien revolving credit facility of up to $50 million.
In connection with the closing of the Wholesome Transaction, on February 5, 2021, we entered into an amendment and restatement agreement (the “Amendment Agreement”) with Toronto Dominion (Texas) LLC, which amended and restated our existing senior secured loan agreement dated as of June 25, 2020 (as amended on September 4, 2020, the “Existing Credit Agreement,” and as further amended by the Amendment Agreement, the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”), by and among Toronto Dominion (Texas), LLC, as administrative agent, certain lenders signatory thereto and certain other parties.
The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for senior secured financing consisting of the following credit facilities: (a) a senior secured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $375 million (the “Term Loan Facility”); and (b) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $75 million (the “Revolving Facility,” and together with the Term Loan Facility, the “Credit Facilities”). The Revolving Facility has a $15 million sub-facility for the issuance of letters of credit and a $15 million sublimit for swing line loans. We used the proceeds under the Term Loan Facility to (i) repay and refinance existing indebtedness of WSO Investments; (ii) pay the cash consideration for the Wholesome Transaction; (iii) repay and refinance outstanding borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement; and (iv) pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing. The proceeds of the Revolving Facility can be used to finance working capital needs, for general corporate purposes, and for working capital adjustments payable under the Wholesome Purchase Agreement. See Note 7 to our audited consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information on our Credit Facilities.
As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, term loan borrowings were $362.2 million and $131.8 million, respectively, net of debt issuance costs of $10.0 million and $4.7 million, respectively. There were $25.0 million and $47.9 million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company’s unamortized debt issuance costs related to the revolving credit facility were $1.8 million and $1.7 million, respectively, which are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were $2.1 million of outstanding letters of credit that reduced our availability under the revolving credit facility.
Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes certain of our obligations as of December 31, 2021 and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in thousands):
(1) Calculated based on debt outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and the interest rates as of that date.
(2) Minimum lease obligations have not been reduced by sublease rental income.
(3) In accordance with the Wholesome Purchase Agreement, the full amount of the contingent consideration was paid on February 23, 2022, of which $30 million was paid in cash, which was funded from available capacity under our revolving credit facility, and we issued 2,659,574 freely tradeable, registered shares of common stock.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to our audited consolidated and combined financial statements. These policies conform with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) and reflect practices appropriate to our businesses. The preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated and combined financial statements and accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from these estimates. We evaluate our policies, estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.
Our critical accounting policies and estimates relate to revenue recognition, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, impairment review of long-lived assets, income taxes and pension benefits. Management continually evaluates the development, selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates. In addition, there are other items within the consolidated and combined financial statements that require the application of accounting policies and estimation, but are not deemed to be critical accounting policies and estimates. Changes in the estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our consolidated and combined financial statements.
Revenue Recognition-In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” the Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Revenues are primarily derived from customer orders for the purchase of products and are generally recognized when the product is shipped or delivered depending on the arrangement with the customer. The Company made an accounting policy election to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price sales taxes and all other items of a similar nature, and also elected to account for shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment of the promise to transfer the goods. Accordingly, shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.
Branded CPG may offer promotional activities (e.g. coupons, trade discounts and other promotional activities) to its customers. These variable consideration amounts are estimated for each customer based on specific arrangements/agreements, an analysis of historical volume, and/or current activity with that customer. Reassessment of variable consideration estimates is done at each reporting date throughout the contract period until the uncertainty is resolved (e.g. promotional campaign is closed and settled with customer).
Historically, the Company has encountered limited instances whereby customers rejected products as a result of orders being materially inaccurate and/or products being defective. The Company tracks the reason codes for those customer returns. Based on that, the materiality of such returns is assessed. A return reserve is calculated (based on historical data as described above) every month to record an adjustment to net sales; these adjustments have not been significant.
Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets-We review goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired, in accordance with ASC Topic 350, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other.” Under ASC Topic 350, the impairment review of goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization must be based on estimated fair values.
Our annual impairment review measurement date is in the fourth quarter of each year. In performing the annual assessment, we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that a reporting unit has been impaired. As part of the qualitative assessment for the reporting units, we evaluate the factors that are specific to the reporting units as well as industry and macroeconomic factors (including changes in interest and discount rates). The reporting unit specific factors may include cost factors, a comparison of current year results to prior year, current year budget and future projected financial performance. We also consider the change in the overall enterprise value of the Company compared to the prior year.
If we determine that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired or if we elect not to perform the optional qualitative assessment, a quantitative assessment is performed utilizing both the income and market approaches to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. The income approach involves discounting future estimated cash flows. The discount rate used is the value-weighted average of the reporting unit’s estimated cost of equity and debt (“cost of capital”) derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics adjusted for company specific risks. We perform sensitivity tests with respect to growth rates and discount rates used in the income approach. In applying the market approach, valuation multiples are derived from historical and projected operating data of selected guideline companies; evaluated and adjusted, if necessary, based on the strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit relative to the selected guideline companies; and applied to the appropriate historical and/or projected operating data to arrive at an indication of fair value. We typically weight the results of the income and market approaches equally. If the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, then an impairment is recorded for the difference, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
We typically evaluate impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relates to our product formulations, by first performing a qualitative assessment. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the product formulations is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is then performed using the relief from royalty method under the income approach to estimate the fair value. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair value include the estimated future annual sales, royalty rates (as a percentage of sales that would hypothetically be charged by a licensor of the brand to an unrelated licensee), income tax considerations and a discount rate that reflects the level of risk.
See Note 6 to our audited consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information.
Impairment Review of Long-Lived Assets-In accordance with ASC Topic 360, “Property, Plant and Equipment,” we evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group may be impaired. When such events occur, we compare the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset or asset group over its remaining depreciable life to the carrying value. If this comparison indicates that there is an impairment, the carrying amount of the long-lived asset would then be reduced to the estimated fair value, which generally approximates discounted cash flows. We also evaluate the amortization periods of assets to determine whether events or circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives. Our applicable long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets.
Income Taxes-The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.
For the Predecessor period, income taxes as presented herein are attributable to current and deferred income taxes of the Company’s financial statements in a manner that is systematic, rational, and consistent with the asset and liability method described by ASC 740. Accordingly, the Company’s income tax provision during the predecessor period was prepared following the separate return method. The separate return method applies ASC 740 to the stand-alone financial statements of each member of the combined group as if the group member were a separate taxpayer and a stand-alone enterprise. Use of the separate return method may result in differences when the sum of the amounts allocated to stand-alone tax provisions are compared with amounts presented in the combined financial statements. In that event, the related deferred tax assets and liabilities could be significantly different from those presented herein. The combined financial statements reflect the Company’s portion of income taxes payable as if the Company had been a separate taxpayer.
The Company made a policy election to treat the income tax due on U.S. inclusion of the global intangible low taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions as a period expense when incurred.
Uncertainty in Income Taxes-The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued under ASC 740, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. The Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company provides loss contingencies for federal, state and international tax matters relating to potential tax examination issues, planning initiatives and compliance responsibilities. The development of these reserves requires judgements about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, which if different, may materially impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. The Company classifies interest and penalties associated with income taxes as a component of the provision (benefit) for income taxes in the consolidated and combined statements of operations.
Pension Benefits-Retirement benefits are provided to certain current and former employees through qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans sponsored by us. It is our policy to fund the minimum for our company-sponsored pension plans as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”). The expected cost of providing the qualified pension plan benefits was accrued over the years that the employees render services, until the plan was frozen on December 31, 2019. The expected cost of providing the non-qualified pension plan benefits is accrued over the years that the employees rendered services. It is our policy to fund non-qualified pension benefits as payments are due. Accounting for pension benefits requires the use of several assumptions and estimates. Actual experience or changes to these assumptions and other estimates could have a significant impact on our consolidated and combined results of operations and financial position. See Note 12 to our audited consolidated and combined financial statements for a summary of all of the key assumptions related to pension benefits as well as a description of our defined benefit pension plans as well as additional disclosures.
We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit pensions as an asset or liability in our consolidated balance sheets and recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which changes occur through comprehensive income (loss). Any changes in the funded status deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are amortized within other income (expense) in future periods using the corridor approach, over an appropriate term. The corridor is 10% of the greater of the market-related value of the plan’s asset or projected benefit obligation.
For our qualified pension plan we utilized a blend of appropriate durations of annuity purchase contracts at December 31, 2021. For our non-qualified pension plans we utilized the Aon Hewitt AA-Only Bond Universe Yield Curve (the “Aon Hewitt Yield Curve”) for discounting future benefit obligations and calculating interest cost. The Aon Hewitt Yield Curve represents the yield on high quality (AA and above) corporate bonds that closely match the cash flows of the estimated payouts for our benefit obligations. As of December 31, 2021, a 0.5% decrease in our discount rate assumptions of 2.61% for our qualified pension plan and 2.42% for our non-qualified pension plans would result in a $0.1 million increase in our pension income for the qualified pension plan and a nominal decrease in our pension expense for our non-qualified pension plans for the year ended December 31, 2021.
We used a multi-pronged approach to determine our 4.90% assumption for the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan assets. This approach included a review of actual historical returns achieved and anticipated long-term performance of each asset class. As of December 31, 2021, a 0.5% decrease in our long-term rate of return assumption would result in a $0.2 million decrease in the pension income of our qualified pension plan for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Our pension plan assets earned a return of 2.9% in 2021 and 13.9% in 2020. The asset returns are net of administrative expenses.
Our pension actuarial valuation also incorporates other factors such as mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to, among other things, longer or shorter life spans of plan participants. Differences in these assumptions could significantly impact the actual amount of net periodic benefit cost and pension liability recorded by us.
Foreign Currency Translation-The Company has determined that the functional currency for each combined subsidiary is its local currency, except for certain entities whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities of entities outside the U.S. are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the end of each period; income and expense items are translated at each period’s average exchange rate; and any resulting translation difference is reported and accumulated as a separate component of combined statements of net parent investment, except for any entities which may operate in highly inflationary economies. Gains and losses resulting from transactions in other than functional currencies are reflected in operating results, except for transactions of a long-term nature.
Remeasurements of European entities whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar as well as translation adjustments for entities operating in highly inflationary economies and impacts of foreign currency transactions are recognized currently in other expense (income), net.
Beginning January 1, 2019, the Company was required to apply highly-inflationary accounting to its Argentinian subsidiary. This accounting treatment requires a change in the subsidiary’s functional currency from the local currency (Argentinian Peso) to the parent’s reporting currency (USD). This highly-inflationary classification results from the fact that the cumulative inflation rate for the preceding 3 year period exceeded 100 percent as of June 30, 2018. When the Company changed the functional currency, it revalued the subsidiary’s financial statements as if the new functional currency (USD) were the reporting currency. Accordingly, effective January 1, 2019, all Argentinian Peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities are considered foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and are revalued to USD (the functional currency) with remeasurement adjustments in the period recorded in the statement of operations. The USD will be the functional currency until the economic environment in Argentina ceases to be considered highly-inflationary.
As of the date of the Business Combination, the assets and liabilities of the Argentinian subsidiary were adjusted to fair value. Certain non-monetary assets and liabilities that were previously recorded at the applicable historical exchange rates are recorded in USD using the exchange rate as of June 25, 2020. Argentinian Peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities continue to be revalued to USD (the functional currency) with remeasurement period adjustments in the period recorded in the statement of operations.
