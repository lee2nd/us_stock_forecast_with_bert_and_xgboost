ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. This report contains certain forward-looking statements relating to future events or our future financial performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in this report. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information which speaks only as of the date of this report. We are not obligated to publicly update this information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent we are required to do so in connection with our obligation to file reports with the SEC. For a discussion of the important risks to our business and future operating performance, see the discussion under the caption “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and under the caption “Factors That May Influence Future Results of Operations” below. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed in this report might not occur.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
We are a leading provider of intelligent wireless solutions including mobile hotspots, routers, trackers, and other devices. Our designs integrate innovative hardware and software, enabling machine-to-machine (M2M) applications and the Internet of Things (IoT). Our M2M and IoT solutions include embedded modules, modems and gateways built to deliver reliable always-on connectivity supporting a broad spectrum of applications based on 5G/4G wireless technology.
We have a majority ownership position in FTI, a research and development company located in Seoul, South Korea. FTI primarily provides design and development services to us for our wireless products.
Our products are generally marketed and sold directly to wireless operators, and indirectly through strategic partners and distributors. Our global customer base extends primarily from North America to countries in the Caribbean and South America, and Asia.
FACTORS THAT MAY INFLUENCE FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
We believe that our revenue growth will be influenced largely by (1) the successful maintenance of our existing customers, (2) the rate of increase in demand for wireless data products, (3) customer acceptance for our new products, (4) new customer relationships and contracts, and (5) our ability to meet customers’ demands.
We have entered into and expect to continue to enter into new customer relationships and contracts for the supply of our products, and this may require significant demands on our resources, resulting in increased operating, selling, and marketing expenses associated with such new customers.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Revenue Recognition
Contracts with Customers
Revenue from sales of products and services is derived from contracts with customers. The products and services covered by contracts primarily consist of hot spot routers. Contracts with each customer generally state the terms of the sale, including the description, quantity and price of each product or service. Payment terms are stated in the contract, primarily in the form of a purchase order. Since the customer typically agrees to a stated rate and price in the purchase order that does not vary over the life of the contract, the majority of our contracts do not contain variable consideration. We establish a provision for estimated warranty and returns. Using historical averages, that provision for the year ended June 30, 2022, was not material.
Disaggregation of Revenue
In accordance with Topic 606, we disaggregate revenue from contracts with customers into geographical regions and by the timing of when goods and services are transferred. We determined that disaggregating revenue into these categories meets the disclosure objective in Topic 606, which is to depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by regional economic factors.
Contract Balances
We perform our obligations under a contract with a customer by transferring products in exchange for consideration from the customer. We typically invoice our customers as soon as control of an asset is transferred, and a receivable is established. We, however, recognize a contract liability when a customer prepays for goods and/or services, or we have not delivered goods under the contract since we have not yet transferred control of the goods and/or services.
The balances of our trade receivables are as follows:
The balance of contract assets was immaterial as we did not have a significant amount of un-invoiced receivables in the periods ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021.
Included in the Accounts Receivable balance is a passthrough amount of $837,000.00. These transactions were a direct result of an agreement between our vendor and our customer. There is a corresponding balance of $837,000 in our Accounts Payable account to offset.
Our contract liabilities, which are included in accrued liabilities on our balance sheet, are as follows:
Performance Obligations
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of measurement in Topic 606. At contract inception, we assess the products and services promised in our contracts with customers. We then identify performance obligations to transfer distinct products or services to the customer. To identify performance obligations, we consider all the products or services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices.
Our performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time. Revenue from products transferred to customers at a single point in time accounted for over 99% of net sales for the year ended June 30, 2022. Revenue for non-recurring engineering projects is based on the percentage completion of a project and accounted for under 1% of net sales for the year ended June 30, 2022. Most of our revenue that is recognized at a point in time is for the sale of hot-spot router products. Revenue from these contracts is recognized when the customer can direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the product, which generally coincides with title transfer at completion of the shipping process.
As of June 30, 2022, our contracts do not contain any unsatisfied performance obligations, except for undelivered products.
Capitalized Product Development Costs
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 350, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other” includes software that is part of a product or process to be sold to a customer and shall be accounted for under Subtopic 985-20. Our products contain embedded software internally developed by FTI, which is an integral part of these products because it allows the various components of the products to communicate with each other and the products are clearly unable to function without this coding.
The costs of product development that are capitalized once technological feasibility is determined (noted as Technology in progress in the Intangible Assets table, in Note 2 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) include certifications, licenses, payroll, employee benefits, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. We determine that technological feasibility for our products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved. Once the products are available for general release to our customers, we cease capitalizing the product development costs and any additional costs, if any, are expensed. The capitalized product development costs are amortized on a product-by-product basis using the straight-line amortization. The amortization begins when the products are available for general release to our customers.
As of June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2021, capitalized product development costs in progress were $187,343 and $602,388, respectively, and these amounts are included in intangible assets in our consolidated balance sheets. During the year ended June 30, 2022, we incurred $658,544 in capitalized product development costs, and all costs incurred before technological feasibility is reached are expensed and included in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
Income Taxes
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of the assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. As of June 30, 2022, we have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $3.3 million and $40,000, respectively.
Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, the federal net operating loss of approximately $2.5 million, which was recognized on or after January 1, 2018, will carry forward indefinitely. The federal net operating loss of approximately $0.8 million, which was recognized on or before December 31, 2017, will expire through 2035. The state net operating loss of approximately $40,000 will begin to expire through 2042. The utilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitations under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code Section 382 and similar state provisions.
Under the provision of ASC 740 “Application of the Uncertain Tax Position Provisions” related to accounting for uncertain tax positions, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements, uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. Tax benefits of an uncertain tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained based on technical merits.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following table sets forth, for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, our statements of operations including data expressed as a percentage of sales:
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2022, COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2021
NET SALES - Net sales decreased by $160,117,583, or 87.0%, to $23,997,762 for the year ended June 30, 2022 from $184,115,345 for the corresponding period of 2021. For the year ended June 30, 2022, net sales by geographic regions, consisting of North America, the Caribbean and South America, and Asia were $23,305,366 (97.1% of net sales), $2,375 (0.0% of net sales), and $690,021 (2.9% of net sales), respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2021, net sales by geographic regions, consisting of North America, the Caribbean and South America, and Asia were $183,771,146 (99.8% of net sales), $17,500 (0.0% of net sales), and $326,699 (0.2% of net sales), respectively.
Net sales in North America decreased by $160,465,780, or 87.3%, to $23,305,366 for the year ended June 30, 2022, from $183,771,146 for the corresponding period of 2021. The decrease in net sales in North America was primarily due to the reduction of demand for wireless products from one major carrier customer, resulting from the unprecedented high volume of demand for wireless products during the prior period, which coincided with the early stages of the Covid-19 Pandemic period. Net sales in the Caribbean and South America decreased by $15,125, or 86.4%, to $2,375 for the year ended June 30, 2022, from $17,500 for the corresponding period of 2021. Net sales in Asia increased by $363,322, or 111.2%, to $690,021 for the year ended June 30, 2022, from $326,699 for the corresponding period of 2021. The increase in net sales was primarily due to the revenue generated from the material sales by FTI, which typically vary from period to period.
GROSS PROFIT- Gross profit decreased by $28,647,438, or 88.2%, to $3,816,583 for the year ended June 30, 2022, from $32,464,021 for the corresponding period of 2021. The gross profit in terms of net sales percentage was 15.9% for the year ended June 30, 2022, compared to 17.6% for the corresponding period of 2021. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the change in net sales as described above. The decrease in gross profit in terms of net sales percentage was primarily due to variations in customer and product mix, competitive selling prices and product costs which generally vary from period to period and region to region.
OPERATING EXPENSES - Operating expenses decreased by $854,236, or 8.9%, to $8,791,475 for the year ended June 30, 2022, from $9,645,711 for the corresponding period of 2021.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by $568,504 to $4,509,344 for the year ended June 30, 2022, from $5,077,848 for the corresponding period of 2021. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses was primarily due to decreased shipping and handling charges of approximately $480,000, decreased payroll expense as well as bad debt expense of approximately $340,000, which are partially offset by the increased compensation expense related to stock options granted for employees and amortization expense of approximately $165,000 and $141,000, respectively.
Research and development expense decreased by $285,732 to $4,282,131 for the year ended June 30, 2022, from $4,567,863 for the corresponding period of 2021. The decrease in research and development expense was primarily due to the decreased payroll expense for employees involved in research and development and other research and development costs of approximately $104,000 and $182,000, respectively.
OTHER INCOME, NET - Other income, net decreased by $351,748, or 57.0%, to $265,419 for the year ended June 30, 2022, from $617,167 for the corresponding period of 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the forgiveness of the Payroll Protection Plan loan during the fiscal year 2021, with no similar transaction in fiscal year 2022, as well as decreased product development funding received by FTI from a government entity. This was partially offset by the gain from the favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates in FTI and the increased interest income earned from the money market accounts and certificates of deposit.
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2021, COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020
NET SALES - Net sales increased by $109,043,047, or 145.3%, to $184,115,345 for the year ended June 30, 2021 from $75,072,298 for the corresponding period of 2020. For the year ended June 30, 2021, net sales by geographic regions, consisting of North America, the Caribbean and South America, and Asia were $183,771,146 (99.8% of net sales), $17,500 (0.0% of net sales), and $326,699 (0.2% of net sales), respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2020, net sales by geographic regions, consisting of North America, the Caribbean and South America, and Asia were $74,839,778 (99.7% of net sales), $0 (0.0% of net sales), and $232,520 (0.3% of net sales), respectively.
Net sales in North America increased by $108,931,368, or 145.6%, to $183,771,146 for the year ended June 30, 2021, from $74,839,778 for the corresponding period of 2020. The increase in net sales in North America resulted primarily from increased demand for wireless connectivity due to people working and attending school remotely. High volume sales to school districts rapidly rolling out remote learning programs was a significant driver for increased sales through our primary customers due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Net sales also increased due to the timing of orders placed by a carrier customer, from which a significant portion of our revenue was derived (approximately 63% of our consolidated net sales for this period). Net sales in the Caribbean and South America increased by $17,500, or 100.0%, to $17,500 for the year ended June 30, 2021, from $0 for the corresponding period of 2020. Net sales in Asia increased by $94,179, or 40.5%, to $326,699 for the year ended June 30, 2021, from $232,520 for the corresponding period of 2020. The increase in net sales was primarily due to product development service revenue generated by FTI, which typically varies from period to period.
GROSS PROFIT- Gross profit increased by $17,939,536, or 123.5%, to $32,464,021 for the year ended June 30, 2021, from $14,524,485 for the corresponding period of 2020. The gross profit in terms of net sales percentage was 17.6% for the year ended June 30, 2021, compared to 19.3% for the corresponding period of 2020. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the change in net sales as described above. The decrease in gross profit in terms of net sales percentage was primarily due to competitive selling prices and the increase in production costs.
OPERATING EXPENSES - Operating expenses increased by $2,199,350, or 29.5%, to $9,645,711 for the year ended June 30, 2021, from $7,446,361 for the corresponding period of 2020.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $1,377,989 to $5,077,848 for the year ended June 30, 2021, from $3,699,859 for the corresponding period of 2020. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased payroll expense as well as compensation expense related to stock options granted for employees (approximately $560,000), increased bad debt expense of approximately $340,000, increased professional fees of approximately $130,000, and increased shipping and handling charges of approximately $80,000.
Research and development expense increased by $821,361 to $4,567,863 for the year ended June 30, 2021, from $3,746,502 for the corresponding period of 2020. The increase in research and development expense was primarily due to the increased payroll expense for employees involved in research and development and other research and development costs.
OTHER INCOME, NET - Other income, net increased by $396,403, or 179.6%, to $617,167 for the year ended June 30, 2021, from $220,764 for the corresponding period of 2020. The increase was primarily due to the gain from the forgiveness of the Payroll Protection Plan loan and increased product development funding received by FTI from a government entity, which was partially offset by the loss from the unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates in FTI and the decreased interest income earned from the money market accounts and certificates of deposit.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our historical operating results, capital resources and financial position, in combination with current projections and estimates, were considered in management's plan and intentions to fund our operations over a reasonable period of time, which we define as the twelve-month period ending June 30, 2022. For purposes of liquidity disclosures, we assess the likelihood that we have sufficient available working capital and other principal sources of liquidity to fund our operating activities and obligations as they become due.
Our principal source of liquidity as of June 30, 2022, consisted of cash and cash equivalents as well as short-term investments of $42,614,077. We believe we have sufficient available capital to cover our existing operations and obligations through at least June 30, 2023. Our long-term future cash requirements will depend on numerous factors, including our revenue base, profit margins, product development activities, market acceptance of our products, future expansion plans and ability to control costs. If we are unable to achieve our current business plan or secure additional funding that may be required, we would need to curtail our operations or take other similar actions outside the ordinary course of business in order to continue to operate as a going concern.
OPERATING ACTIVITIES - Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2022, was $7,407,355, and net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2021 was $12,104,199.
The $7,407,355 in net cash used in operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2022, was primarily due to the increase in inventory and decrease in accounts payable of $3,222,344 and $1,537,287, respectively, as well as our operating results (net loss adjusted for depreciation, amortization, and other non-cash charges), which was offset by the decrease of accounts receivable of $1,205,938.
The $12,104,199 in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2021, was primarily due to the decrease in accounts receivable and inventory of $13,103,973 and $10,807,884, respectively, as well as our operating results (net income adjusted for depreciation, amortization and other non-cash charges), which was offset by the decrease in accounts payable of $32,364,266.
INVESTING ACTIVITIES - Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended June 30, 2022, and 2021 was $11,675,028 and $722,520, respectively.
The $11,675,028 in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2022, was primarily due to the purchases of short-term investments and capitalized product development of $10,950,625 and $658,544, respectively. The $722,520 in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2021, was primarily due to the purchases of capitalized product development and property and equipment of $694,909 and $21,043, respectively.
FINANCING ACTIVITIES - Net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended June 30, 2022, and 2021 was $75,445 and $6,074,759, respectively.
The $75,445 in net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2022, was from the exercise of stock options. The $6,074,759 in net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2021, was primarily due to the $6,000,008 aggregate purchase price, paid to us in cash by investors for the issuance of 923,078 shares of Common Stock, as well as $74,751 received from the exercise of stock options.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
None.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of June 30, 2022, and the effect such obligations could have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods:
LEASES
Refer to ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.
FUTURE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
For the next twelve months, we may require in excess of $5 million for capital expenditures, software licenses and for testing and certifying new products.
We believe we will be able to fund our future cash requirements for operations from our cash available, operating cash flows, bank lines of credit and issuance of equity securities. We believe these sources of funds will be sufficient to continue our operations and planned capital expenditures. However, we will be required to raise additional debt or equity capital if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund the expansion of our sales and to satisfy the related working capital requirements for the next twelve months. Our ability to satisfy such obligations also depends upon our future performance, which in turn is subject to general economic conditions and regional risks, and to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, including factors beyond our control. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors” included in this report.
If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our obligations and commitments, we will be required to raise additional debt or equity capital. Additionally, we may be required to sell material assets or operations or delay or forego expansion opportunities. We might not be able to affect these alternative strategies to raise funds including credit lines and loans, on satisfactory terms, if at all.
