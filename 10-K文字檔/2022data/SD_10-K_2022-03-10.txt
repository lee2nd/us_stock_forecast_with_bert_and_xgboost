We have applied the Securities and Exchange Commission’s adopted FAST Act Modernization and Simplification of Regulation S-K, which limits the discussion to the two most recent calendar years. This discussion and analysis deals with comparisons of material changes in the consolidated financial statements for years ended 2021 and 2020. For the comparison of years ended 2020 and 2019, see “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 4, 2021.
Overview
We are an independent oil and natural gas company with a principal focus on acquisition, development and production activities in the U.S. Mid-Continent. Prior to February 5, 2021, we held assets in the North Park Basin, which have been sold in their entirety.
Operational Activities
There was no drilling activity on our operated acreage during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. However, we brought wells that were previously not producing on to production as part of our well reactivation program during the year ended December 31, 2021.
The chart below shows production by product for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
(1)For the year ended December 31, 2021, North Park Basin had 67 MBoe in oil production.
(2)For the year ended December 31, 2020, North Park Basin had 940 MBoe in oil production.
Total production for 2021 was comprised of approximately 14.1% oil, 52.5% natural gas and 33.4% NGLs compared to 23.9% oil, 45.1% natural gas and 31.0% NGLs in 2020.
Mid-Continent total production for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was comprised of the following:
Highlighted Events
•On February 5, 2021, we sold all of our oil and natural gas properties and related assets of the North Park Basin ("NPB") in Colorado for a purchase price of $47 million in cash. Net proceeds were $39.7 million in cash as a result of customary effective date adjustments and a $0.8 million post-close adjustment made during the second half of the year. The sale resulted in a $18.9 million gain after the post-close adjustment.

•On April 22, 2021, we announced the acquisition of all the overriding royalty interest assets of SandRidge Mississippian Trust I (the “Trust”). The gross purchase price is $4.9 million (net $3.6 million, given our 26.9% ownership of the Trust).

Giesler, Jr. submitted his resignation from his positions as CEO, President and as a member of the Board of the Company, effective July 16, 2021 in order to pursue another career opportunity.

The Program does not require any specific number of shares to be acquired, and can be modified or discontinued by the Board at any time. We did not repurchase any common stock under the Program during the year ended December 31, 2021.
•On September 2, 2021, we repaid our $20.0 million term loan in full and terminated all commitments and obligations under the 2020 Credit Facility. Our repayment of the term loan satisfied all of our remaining term debt and revolving debt obligations.

Outlook
As discussed in “Business- Our Business Strategy” in Item 1 of this report, we will focus on growing the cash value and generation capability of our asset base in a safe, responsible and efficient manner, while exercising prudent capital allocations to projects we believe provide high rates of returns in the current commodity price environment. These projects include a continuation of our well reactivation program, artificial lift conversions to more efficient and cost effective systems, as well as focused drilling in high-graded areas, which will aide in partially offsetting the natural decline of our producing asset's. Forward looking commodity prices, results, costs and other factors will shape our development decisions in 2022 and beyond. We will also remain vigilant and maintain optionality for opportunistic, value-accretive acquisitions and business combinations.
As the impact of COVID-19 lessens, demand for commodities is continuing to rise to pre-pandemic levels within the United States. The resurging demand led to favorable commodity prices during the year ended December 31, 2021. However, the spread of COVID-19 variants and the effectiveness of the vaccines against these variants are significant risk factors to a full and sustained recovery. If the vaccines currently available are not effective against COVID-19 or its other variants, Governments and other regulatory bodies may have to rely on mobility and activity restrictions to mitigate the spread, which could lead to reduced demand for certain commodities. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in Part I of this Annual Report for additional discussion of the potential impact these events may have on our future revenues.
Consolidated Results of Operations
The majority of our consolidated revenues and cash flow are generated from the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices received for our production, the quantity of oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce, and our ability to find and economically develop and produce our reserves. Prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs fluctuate widely and are difficult to predict. To provide information on the general trend in pricing, the average annual NYMEX prices for oil and natural gas for recent years are presented in the table below:
In order to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations, from time to time we enter into commodity derivative contracts for a portion of our anticipated future oil, natural gas, and NGL production as discussed in
