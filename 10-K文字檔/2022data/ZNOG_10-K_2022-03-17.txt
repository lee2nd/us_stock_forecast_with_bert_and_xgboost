ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Introduction
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes to those consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of our discussion is forward-looking and involves risks and uncertainties. For information regarding factors that could have a material adverse effect on our business, refer to Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Report.
Overview
Zion Oil and Gas, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is an oil and gas exploration company with a history of 22 years of oil and gas exploration in Israel. We were incorporated in Florida on April 6, 2000 and reincorporated in Delaware on July 9, 2003. We completed our initial public offering in January 2007. Our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”) currently trades on the OTCQX under the symbol “ZNOG” and our Common Stock warrant under the symbol “ZNOGW.”
The Company currently holds one active petroleum exploration license onshore Israel, the New Megiddo License 428 (“NML 428”), comprising approximately 99,000 acres. The NML 428 was awarded on December 3, 2020 for a six-month term with the possibility of an additional six-month extension. On April 29, 2021, Zion submitted a request to the Ministry of Energy for a six-month extension to December 2, 2021. On May 30, 2021, the Ministry of Energy approved our request for extension to December 2, 2021. On November 29, 2021, the Ministry of Energy approved our request for extension to August 1, 2022. The ML 428 lies onshore, south and west of the Sea of Galilee and we continue our exploration focus here based on our studies as it appears to possess the key geologic ingredients of an active petroleum system with significant exploration potential.
On March 12, 2020, Zion entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Central European Drilling kft, a Hungarian corporation, to purchase an onshore oil and gas drilling rig, drilling pipe, related equipment and spare parts for a purchase price of $5.6 million in cash, subject to acceptance testing and potential downward adjustment. We remitted to the Seller $250,000 on February 6, 2020 as earnest money towards the Purchase Price. The Closing anticipated by the Agreement took place on March 12, 2020 by the Seller’s execution and delivery of a Bill of Sale to us. On March 13, 2020, the Seller retained the earnest money deposit, and the Company remitted $4,350,000 to the seller towards the purchase price and $1,000,000 (the “Holdback Amount”) was deposited in escrow with American Stock Transfer and Trust Company LLC.
I-35 Drilling Rig & Associated Equipment
(1) These are the initial cash payments for the purchase of the I-35 drilling rig in early 2020
(2) Capitalized costs include inspection, quarantine, labor, transportation, insurance, and other costs required to place the I-35 drilling rig in service initially, per GAAP.
On January 6, 2021, Zion completed its acceptance testing of the I-35 drilling rig and the Holdback Amount was remitted to Central European Drilling on January 8, 2021.
Zion’s ability to fully undertake all of these aforementioned activities was subject to its raising the needed capital through the issuance of our securities, and we anticipate we will continue to need to raise funds through the issuance of equity securities (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities). No assurance can be provided that we will be successful in raising the needed equity on favorable terms (or at all).
Our executive offices are located at 12655 N Central Expressway, Suite 1000, Dallas, Texas 75243, and our telephone number is (214) 221-4610. Our field office in Israel is located at 9 Halamish Street, North Industrial Park, Caesarea 3088900, and the telephone number is +972-4-623-8500.
Principal Components of our Cost Structure
Our operating and other expenses primarily consist of the following:
● Impairment of Unproved Oil and Gas Properties: Impairment expense is recognized if a determination is made that a well will not be commercially productive. The amounts include amounts paid in respect of the drilling operations as well as geological and geophysical costs and various amounts that were paid to Israeli regulatory authorities.
● General and Administrative Expenses: Overhead, including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff, costs of managing our exploratory operations, audit and other professional fees, and legal compliance is included in general and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses also include non-cash stock-based compensation expense, investor relations related expenses, lease and insurance and related expenses.
● Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion: The systematic expensing of the capital costs incurred to explore for natural gas and oil represents a principal component of our cost structure. As a full cost company, we capitalize all costs associated with our exploration, and apportion these costs to each unit of production, if any, through depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. As we have yet to have production, the costs of abandoned wells are written off immediately versus being included in this amortization pool.
Going Concern Basis
Since we have limited capital resources, no revenue to date and a loss from operations, our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The appropriateness of using the going concern basis is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional financing or equity capital and, ultimately, to achieve profitable operations. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Critical Accounting Policies
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expense during the reporting period.
We have identified the accounting principles which we believe are most critical to the reported financial status by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex of subjective decisions or assessment.
Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties
We follow the full-cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties. Accordingly, all costs associated with acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas reserves, including directly related overhead costs, are capitalized.
All capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, including the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves, are amortized on the unit-of-production method using estimates of proved reserves. Investments in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs. If the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired, the amount of the impairment is included in income from continuing operations before income taxes, and the adjusted carrying amount of the unproved properties is amortized on the unit-of-production method.
Our oil and gas properties represent an investment in unproved properties. These costs are excluded from the amortized cost pool until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired. All costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred. The amount of any impairment is charged to expense since a reserve base has not yet been established. A further impairment requiring a charge to expense may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results, relinquishing drilling rights or other information.
Abandonment of properties is accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs. The net capitalized costs are subject to a “ceiling test” which limits such costs to the aggregate of the estimated present value of future net revenues from proved reserves discounted at ten percent based on current economic and operating conditions, plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties. The recoverability of amounts capitalized for oil and gas properties is dependent upon the identification of economically recoverable reserves, together with obtaining the necessary financing to exploit such reserves and the achievement of profitable operations.
During the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively, the Company did not record any post-impairment charges. (See note 4).
The total net book value of our unproved oil and gas properties under the full cost method is $46,950,000 and $15,526,000 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Currency Utilized
Although our oil & gas properties and our principal operations are in Israel, we report all our transactions in United States dollars. Certain dollar amounts in the consolidated financial statements may represent the dollar equivalent of other currencies.
Valuation of Deferred Taxes
We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that we believe is likely to be realized in the future. In assessing the need for the valuation allowance, we have considered not only future taxable income but also feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. In the event that we were to determine that it would be likely that we would, in the future, realize our deferred tax assets in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made. In the period that such a determination was made, the adjustment to the deferred tax asset would produce an increase in our net income.
Asset Retirement Obligation
We record a liability for asset retirement obligation at fair value in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived assets.
Fair Value Considerations
We follow ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” as amended by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Financial Staff Position (FSP) No. 157 and related guidance. Those provisions relate to the Company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value and the fair value disclosures related to financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820 defines fair value, expands related disclosure requirements, and specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on the nature of the inputs used to develop the fair value measures. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, assuming the transaction occurs in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability.
There are three levels of inputs to fair value measurements - Level 1, meaning the use of quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2, meaning the use of quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or are directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, meaning the use of unobservable inputs. We use Level 1 inputs for fair value measurements whenever there is an active market, with actual quotes, market prices, and observable inputs on the measurement date. We use Level 2 inputs for fair value measurements whenever there are quoted prices for similar securities in an active market or quoted prices for identical securities in an inactive market. We use observable market data whenever available. We use Level 3 inputs in the Binomial Model used for the valuation of the derivative liability.
Derivative Liabilities
In accordance with ASC 815-40-25 and ASC 815-10-15 Derivatives and Hedging and ASC 480-10-25 Liabilities-Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, the embedded derivatives associated with the Convertible Bonds are accounted for as liabilities during the term of the related Convertible Bonds.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following table sets forth our Statements of Operations data for the years ended December 31 (all data is in thousands of USD):
FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021 COMPARED TO DECEMBER 31, 2020
Revenue. We currently have no revenue generating operations.
Operating costs and expenses. Operating costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $10,881,000 compared to $6,254,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in costs in 2021 is primarily attributable to an increase in general and administrative expenses related to non-cash expenses associated with stock option grants.
General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $7,594,000 compared to $4,291,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in costs in 2021 is primarily attributable to an increase in general and administrative expenses related to non-cash expenses associated with stock option grants.
Other expenses. Other expenses during the year ended December 31, 2021 were $3,287,000 compared to $1,963,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. These expenses are comprised of non-compensation and non-professional expenses incurred. The increase in expenses during 2021 is primarily attributable to higher investor relations activities and depreciation expenses related to the rig asset.
Loss (gain) on derivative liability. Loss (gain) on derivative liability during the year ended December 31, 2021 was ($431,000) compared to $302,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. An embedded derivative is contained within the valuation of Zion’s $100 convertible bond offering which closed in March 2016 and was fully paid in May 2021. The (gain) on derivative liability during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the loss on derivative liability during the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily due to the change in the share price of our common stock that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Other expense, net. Other expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $271,000 compared to $440,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in these expenses in 2021 is primarily attributable to financial expenses related to the Company’s convertible bonds and to exchange rate differences associated with the fluctuating exchange rates of the New Israeli Shekels (“NIS”) with the U.S. Dollar (“USD”).
Net Loss. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $10,721,000 compared to $6,996,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The primary driver of the higher net loss in 2021 is the increase in stock option grants in 2021 when compared to 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is a measure of a company’s ability to meet potential cash requirements. As discussed above, we have historically met our capital requirements through the issuance of common stock as well as proceeds from the exercise of warrants and options to purchase common shares.
Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining the necessary financing to complete further exploration and development activities and generate profitable operations from our oil and natural gas interests in the future. Our current operations are dependent upon the adequacy of our current assets to meet our current expenditure requirements and the accuracy of management’s estimates of those requirements. Should those estimates be materially incorrect, our ability to continue as a going concern will be impaired. Our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. We have incurred a history of operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Currently, we are substantially reliant on the proceeds of sales of our common stock under the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. During the past two completed fiscal years, we have financed our operations primarily from the proceeds of sales of our stock under the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we raised approximately $26,219,000 and $28,390,000, respectively, under the Plan. Of the amounts raised, approximately 85% of the amounts raised in 2020 were attributable to one participant and 67% of the amounts raised in 2021 were attributable to two participants. The cessation of funding from these participants may result in adverse consequences to our business, such as a delay in our testing efforts, until we locate alternate sources for this funding.
At December 31, 2021, and 2020, we had approximately $4,683,000 in cash and cash equivalents compared to $11,708,000 at December 31, 2020. Our working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) was $3,303,000 at December 31, 2021 and $11,812,000 at December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company provided Israeli-required bank guarantees to various governmental bodies (approximately $1,189,000 and $1,876,000, respectively) and others (approximately $94,000 and $88,000, respectively) with respect to its drilling operation in an aggregate amount of approximately $1,283,000 and $1,964,000, respectively. The (cash) funds backing these guarantees are held in restricted interest-bearing accounts and are reported on the Company’s balance sheets as fixed short-term bank deposits - restricted.
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, cash used in operating activities totaled $5,813,000 and $9,921,000, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $26,125,000 and $28,367,000, respectively, and is primarily attributable to proceeds received from the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the “DSPP” or “Plan”). Net cash used in investing activities such as drilling costs for our MJ-02 exploratory well, purchase of equipment and spare parts was $29,022,000 and $9,719,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Accounting standards require management to evaluate our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year subsequent to the date of the filing of this Form 10-K. We expect to incur additional significant expenditures to further our exploration and development programs. While we raised approximately $8,707,000 during the period January 1, 2022 through March 15, 2022, we will need to raise additional funds in order to continue our exploration and development activities in our license area. Additionally, we estimate that, when we are not actively drilling a well, our expenditures are approximately $600,000 per month excluding exploratory operational activities. However, when we are actively drilling a well, we estimate an additional minimum expenditure of approximately $2,500,000 per month. The above estimates are subject to change. Subject to the qualifications specified below, management believes that our existing cash balance, coupled with anticipated proceeds under the DSPP, will be sufficient to finance our plan of operations through December 2022.
The recent outbreak of the coronavirus has to date significantly disrupted business operations and resulted in significantly increased unemployment in the general economy. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our operations, specifically our capital raising efforts, as well as our ability to continue our exploratory efforts, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others.
No assurance can be provided that we will be able to raise the needed operating capital.
Even if we raise the needed funds, there are factors that can nevertheless adversely impact our ability to fund our operating needs, including (without limitation), unexpected or unforeseen cost overruns in drilling and planned non-drilling exploratory work in existing license areas, the costs associated with extended delays in undertaking the required exploratory work, and plugging and abandonment activities which is typical of what we have experienced in the past.
The financial information contained in these consolidated financial statements has been prepared on a basis that assumes that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. This financial information and these consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
The Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan
On March 13, 2014 Zion filed a registration statement on Form S-3 that is part of a replacement registration statement that was filed with the SEC using a “shelf” registration process. The registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on March 31, 2014. On February 23, 2017, the Company filed a Form S-3 with the SEC (Registration No. 333-216191) as a replacement for the Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-193336), for which the three year period ended March 31, 2017, along with the base Prospectus and Supplemental Prospectus. The Form S-3, as amended, and the new base Prospectus became effective on March 10, 2017, along with the Prospectus Supplement that was filed and became effective on March 10, 2017. The Prospectus Supplement under Registration No. 333-216191 describes the terms of the DSPP and replaces the prior Prospectus Supplement, as amended, under the prior Registration No. 333-193336.
On March 27, 2014, we launched our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the “DSPP”) pursuant to which stockholders and interested investors can purchase shares of the Company’s Common Stock as well as units of the Company’s securities directly from the Company. The terms of the DSPP are described in the Prospectus Supplement originally filed on March 31, 2014 (the “Original Prospectus Supplement”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under the Company’s effective registration Statement on Form S-3, as thereafter amended.
On January 13, 2015, the Company amended the Original Prospectus Supplement (“Amendment No. 3”) to provide for a unit option (the “Unit Option”) under the DSPP comprised of one share of Common Stock and three Common Stock purchase warrants with each unit priced at $4.00. Each warrant afforded the participant the opportunity to purchase the Company’s Common Stock at a warrant exercise price of $1.00. Each of the three warrants series has different expiration dates that have been extended.
The ZNWAB warrants first became exercisable on May 2, 2016 and, in the case of ZNWAC on May 2, 2017 and in the case of ZNWAD on May 2, 2018, at a per share exercise price of $1.00.
As of May 2, 2017, any outstanding ZNWAB warrants expired.

On May 29, 2019, the Company extended the termination date of the ZNWAD Warrant by one (1) year from the expiration date of May 2, 2020 to May 2, 2021. Zion considers this warrant as permanent equity per ASC 815-40-35-2. As such, there is no value assigned to this extension.
On September 15, 2020, the Company extended the termination date of the ZNWAD Warrant by two (2) years from the expiration date of May 2, 2021 to May 2, 2023. Zion considers this warrant as permanent equity per ASC 815-40-35-2. As such, there is no value assigned to this extension.
On November 1, 2016, the Company launched a unit offering under the Company’s DSPP pursuant to which participants could purchase units comprised of seven shares of Common Stock and seven Common Stock purchase warrants, at a per unit purchase price of $10. The warrant is referred to as “ZNWAE.”

On May 29, 2019, the Company extended the termination date of the ZNWAE Warrant by one (1) year from the expiration date of May 1, 2020 to May 1, 2021. Zion considers this warrant as permanent equity per ASC 815-40-35-2. As such, there is no value assigned to this extension.
On September 15, 2020, the Company extended the termination date of the ZNWAE Warrant by two (2) years from the expiration date of May 1, 2021 to May 1, 2023. Zion considers this warrant as permanent equity per ASC 815-40-35-2. As such, there is no value assigned to this extension.
The warrant terms provide that if the Company’s Common Stock trades above $5.00 per share at the closing price for 15 consecutive trading days at any time prior to the expiration date of the warrant, the Company may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the termination of the warrant upon providing 60 days advanced notice to the warrant holders.
On May 22, 2017, the Company launched a new unit offering. This unit offering consisted of a new combination of common stock and warrants, a new time period in which to purchase under the program, and a new unit price, but otherwise the same unit program features, conditions and terms in the Prospectus Supplement applied. The unit offering terminated on July 12, 2017. This unit offering enabled participants to purchase Units of the Company’s securities where each Unit (priced at $250.00 each) was comprised of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing $250.00 (the price of one Unit) by the average of the high and low sale prices of the Company’s Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ on the unit purchase date and (ii) Common Stock purchase warrants to purchase an additional 25 shares of Common Stock at a warrant exercise price of $1.00 per share. The warrant is referred to as “ZNWAF.”
All ZNWAF warrants became exercisable on August 14, 2017 and continued to be exercisable through August 14, 2020 at a per share exercise price of $1.00.

The warrant terms provide that if the Company’s Common Stock trades above $5.00 per share as the closing price for 15 consecutive trading days at any time prior to the expiration date of the warrant, the Company has the sole discretion to accelerate the termination date of the warrant upon providing 60 days advanced notice to the warrant holders.
An Amendment No. 2 to the Prospectus Supplement (as described below) was filed on October 12, 2017.
Under Amendment No. 2, the Company initiated another unit offering which terminated on December 6, 2017. This unit offering enabled participants to purchase Units of the Company’s securities where each Unit (priced at $250.00 each) was comprised of (i) a certain number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing $250.00 (the price of one Unit) by the average of the high and low sale prices of the Company’s Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ on the unit purchase date and (ii) Common Stock purchase warrants to purchase an additional 15 shares of Common Stock at a warrant exercise price of $1.00 per share. The warrant is referred to as “ZNWAG.”
The warrants became exercisable on January 8, 2018 and continues to be exercisable through January 8, 2023 at a per share exercise price of $1.00. The warrant terms provide that if the Company’s Common Stock trades above $5.00 per share as the closing price for 15 consecutive trading days at any time prior to the expiration date of the warrant, the Company has the sole discretion to accelerate the termination date of the warrant upon providing 60 days advanced notice to the warrant holders.

On May 4, 2020, the Company paid its annual 10% interest to its bondholders of record on April 20, 2020. The interest was paid-in-kind (“PIK”) in the form of Common Stock.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
The Company does not believe that the adoption of any recently issued accounting pronouncements in 2021 had a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flow, except for ASC Update No. 2016-02-Leases, which requires organizations to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP.

ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (including interim periods within those periods) using a modified retrospective approach and early adoption is permitted.
