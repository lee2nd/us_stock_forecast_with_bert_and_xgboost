ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
A. Plan of Operation
Overview
The Company’s business is the development of next-generation nuclear medicines for the treatment of cancer and related diseases. Our initial technology is Samarium-153 DOTMP, a/k/a CycloSam® (“CycloSam®” or the “New Technology”), a clinical-stage bone targeting radiopharmaceutical. The FDA cleared our IND in August 2021 to commence clinical trials of CycloSam® on patients with metastatic bone cancer, an open-label, dose escalating trial that may result in sufficient data to move subsequently into a pivotal trial.
On April 20, 2020, we executed a Patent and Technology License Agreement and Trademark Assignment (the “License Agreement”) with IGL Pharma Inc. (“IGL”), through a newly created, wholly-owned subsidiary called QSAM Therapeutics Inc. (“QSAM Therapeutics”), which License Agreement was mutually amended on November 24, 2021. The License Agreement provides QSAM Therapeutics with exclusive, worldwide and sub-licensable rights to all of IGL’s patents, product data and knowhow with respect to CycloSam®. The License Agreement also transfers to QSAM Therapeutics the rights to the product name CycloSam® for the technology, and provides QSAM Therapeutics a first right of refusal to license other technologies from IGL in the future.
On November 6, 2020, the Company entered into an Omnibus Separation Agreement (the “Separation Agreement”) with its unconsolidated investee, Earth Property Holdings LLC (“EPH”). Our board of directors approved the Separation Agreement in furtherance of its previously disclosed plan to secure new technologies and business opportunities in the broader biosciences sector, and to significantly reduce debt and liabilities of the Company and eliminate under-performing assets and agreements.
The Separation Agreement marked a discontinuance of the Company’s soil health operations (the “Legacy Business”) to focus solely on the development of its exclusively licensed radiopharmaceutical drug candidate, CycloSam®, as well as other drug candidates that it may license or otherwise secure in the future. Revenue and expenses from the Legacy Business are presented on our consolidated financial statements as “Discontinued Operations.”
New Equity and Debt Financings; S-1 Registration
To advance the development of the New Technology, in November 2020 we commenced a $2.5 million Series B Preferred stock offering (the “Series B Offering”). We completed the Series B Offering in January 2021, raising $2.5 million inclusive of $156,000 in debt conversion, and issuing a total of 2,500 shares of Series B Preferred Stock.
In connection with this Series B Offering closing, our Board approved a modification to the offering terms in January 2021, and we issued in that month a total of 6.27 million common stock warrants. These warrants were originally exercisable prior to July 8, 2021 at an exercise price of $0.35 per share, and later modified by our Board to expire on October 15, 2021 and be exercisable at $0.25 per share. As of October 15, 2021, seven holders of the Series B warrants exercised those warrants and received a total of 1,871,431 common shares for total consideration to the Company of $467,858. Also in 2021, our lead investor in the Series B Offering earned a warrant for 475,000 shares exercisable at $0.45 per share, which warrant was to expire January 15, 2022, but modified in 2022 to expire January 15, 2023.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we entered into convertible note purchase agreements with eight accredited investors, pursuant to which we issued an aggregate of $605,000 of convertible notes (the “Notes”). The Notes mature on December 31, 2023 and are convertible into shares of common stock of the Company in the event of future equity financing of $5 million or greater, NASDAQ uplisting, or at the discretion of the noteholders, at a conversion price of $0.20 per share. The obligations under the Notes are unsecured. The Company has agreed to pay simple interest at the rate of 6% per annum on the outstanding amount of the Notes until fully repaid or converted. In connection with the Notes offering, the Company issued 1,008,334 warrants to the noteholders, with each warrant convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.60 per share beginning from the date of the warrant until October 31, 2022. The outstanding balance of the Notes as of December 31, 2021 was $605,000, exclusive of accrued interest.
In December 2021, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC to raise up to $20 million through a common stock offering underwritten by Think Equity LLC, an investment bank based in New York. Concurrently, the Company submitted an application with the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC to list its common shares on that national exchange. While management believes these transactions could be completed in the first quarter of 2022, there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to complete the equity offering or have its shares listed on NASDAQ.
The process of developing pharmaceutical products is extremely costly, especially as such programs enter clinical trials, as our radiopharmaceutical candidate has. The Company will need to raise additional capital to continue these activities in 2022 and beyond. As of the end of 2021, the Company had approximately $1.5 million in cash. Such funds are sufficient to cover the Company’s current operational burn through 2022; however, given the additional costs of conducting our clinical trials, such funds will likely be extinguished in the first two quarters of 2022. It is critical, therefore, for the Company to complete is currently anticipated registered, underwritten equity offering to maintain our clinical trials, or otherwise raise additional capital through equity or debt offerings. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in these efforts.
B. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. Although our operations were not materially affected by the Covid outbreak, in the recent months, Covid has had direct impact on the commencement of our clinical trials. Due to Covid infections at one of our vendor labs, team members leading certain startup activities for our project were sent home and work could only be initiated upon their return, causing us to delay a key procedure, which was ultimately completed. General conditions around Covid have also created supply chain delays with certain of our manufacturers and distributors. Lastly, there remains a risk with the rise of Covid cases in the US could delay enrollment of patients into our clinical trials, interrupt treatment, or cause a patient to withdraw due to prolonged effects of infection. To mitigate these risks, we have worked with our vendors and suppliers to designate and train additional staff to support our project, and we have ordered sufficient supplies to support our entire Phase I trial. We are also securing secondary suppliers to ensure supply chain resilience. Additionally, we are working with our clinical trial site to screen more patients in order to have a sufficient volume of qualified patients waiting to enroll.
Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded no revenue from continuing operations. Revenue from a management agreement with EPH and other Legacy Business operations have been reclassified in our Statement of Operations on our Consolidated Financial Statements as “discontinued operations.”
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a net loss from continuing operations of $11,977,065, an increase of $6,157,128 (105.8%) from our net loss from continuing operations of $5,819,937 for the same period in 2020. Basic and diluted net loss per share was $0.43 and $0.89 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The primary reasons for the increase in the net loss for 2021 over 2020 were an increase of $7,917,761 in compensation and related expenses (mainly non-cash items as discussed below), as well as an increase in professional fees of $1,542,985; offset slightly by a decrease of $28,724 in general and administrative expenses.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
For year ended December 31, 2021, cash increased by $1,491,562 from $8,304 as of December 31, 2020 to $1,499,866 at the end of 2021. This increase was primarily the result of cash provided by financing activities of $3,260,364, offset by cash used in operating activities of $1,768,803.
Net cash used by operating activities was $1,768,803 for the year ended December 31, 2021, which reflected our net loss during the period of $11,977,065, non-cash adjustments of $10,034,326, a net increase in operating liabilities of $331,055, and a net increase in operating assets of $157,118. The majority of non-cash adjustments consists of a $7,826,779 stock-based compensation for the issuance of Series E-1 shares and the subsequent exchange of the Series E-1 shares into common stock, $744,505 on the loss on conversion of bridge notes and accrued interest into common stock, and $390,069 on the loss on conversion of debentures into common stock. Our net loss resulted largely from these non-cash items. Net cash used in investing activities during year ended December 31, 2021 consisted of $0.
At December 31, 2021, our cash totaled $1,499,866. Our cash is currently held at large U.S. banks.
Based on our current strategy and operating plan, at the end of 2020 we needed to raise additional capital to support operations through the coming year. This was accomplished during 2021; however, at the end of 2021 there was still substantial doubt about our ability to operate as a going concern. See “Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Going Concern” in our consolidated financial statements.
As the Company enters its clinical trials, management expects expenses to increase materially. These expenses include dosing and monitoring of patients who participate in our clinical trials, manufacturing expenses, payment of fees to our CRO and other service providers, and other general overhead expenses including additional public company costs. We anticipate that we will be able to proceed with these plans if we are successful in raising additional funds through our planned underwritten equity offering. There is no guarantee, however, that we can complete this offering on terms suitable to the Company and its shareholders if at all.
Series B Financing. In January 2021, the Company closed a Series B Convertible Preferred Stock private placement (the “Series B Offering”) and issued a total of 2,500 shares at a price of $1,000 per share, raising an aggregate amount of $2.5 million, inclusive of $156,000 in debt conversion. The Series B Offering, which commenced in 2020, was led by Checkmate Capital Group, LLC, a California based investment firm focused on biotechnology and other technology investments. The Company completed the offering primarily to advance its new business of drug development including funding the Company’s upcoming clinical trials for its drug candidate CycloSam, as well as for general working capital and overhead.
Warrant Conversion. In connection with this Series B Offering closing, we issued in 2021 a total of 6.27 million common stock warrants, which were originally exercisable prior to July 8, 2021 at an exercise price of $0.35 per share, and later modified by our Board to expire on October 15, 2021 and be exercisable at $0.25 per share. As of October 15, 2021, seven holders of the Series B warrants exercised those warrants and received a total of 1,871,431 common shares for total consideration to the Company of $467,858.
Convertible Note Financing. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we entered into convertible note purchase agreements with eight accredited investors, pursuant to which we issued an aggregate of $605,000 of convertible notes (the “Notes”). The Notes mature on December 31, 2023 and are convertible into shares of common stock of the Company in the event of future equity financing of $5 million or greater, NASDAQ uplisting, or at the discretion of the noteholders, at a conversion price of $0.20 per share. The obligations under the Notes are unsecured. The Company has agreed to pay simple interest at the rate of 6% per annum on the outstanding amount of the Notes until fully repaid or converted. In connection with the Notes offering, the Company issued 1,008,334 warrants to the noteholders, with each warrant convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.60 per share beginning from the date of the warrant until October 31, 2022. The outstanding balance of the Notes as of December 31, 2021 was $605,000, exclusive of accrued interest.
Prior Bridge Note Financing. The Company issued a total of $2,851,908 in Convertible Promissory Notes (the “Bridge Notes”) during 2017, 2018 and 2019. Proceeds from the Bridge Notes were used to for the Company’s Legacy Business. As of December 31, 2020, a total of $1,965,030 plus $964,525 in accrued interest on the Bridge Notes were converted into approximately 13.3 million shares of common stock. As of March 31, 2021, the remaining $1,447,312 of principal and interest was converted into 6,578,702 shares of common stock, and no Bridge Notes currently remain outstanding.
Prior Series A Preferred Stock Financing. The Company raised $600,000 in our Series A 6% Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) from two separate accredited investors in November 2015 and January 2016, respectively. The Series A Preferred Stock bears a 6% dividend per annum, calculable and payable per quarter in cash or additional shares of common stock as determined in the Certificate of Designation. The Series A Preferred Stock was originally convertible at $6.50 per share at the discretion of the holders and contains price protection provisions in the instance that we issue shares at a lower price, subject to certain exemptions. The price has been reset several times since the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock. Most currently, as a result of the closing of the Series B preferred stock offering in January 2021, the conversion price was reset to $0.16 per share. Series A Preferred Stock holders also received other rights and protections including piggy-back registration rights, rights of first refusal to invest in subsequent offerings, security over our assets (secondary to our debt holders), and certain negative covenant guaranties that we will not incur non-ordinary debt, enter into variable pricing security sales, redeem or repurchase stock or make distributions, and other similar warranties. The Series A Preferred Stock was redeemable on July 1, 2019 per a March 2019 modification and is currently in technical default. The Series A Preferred Stock has no voting rights until converted to common stock. The Series A Preferred Stockholders also received warrants in connection with their investment, all of which had expired in January 2021.
All promissory notes and shares in these offerings were sold pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Exchange Commission under Regulation D to accredited or sophisticated investors who completed questionnaires confirming their status. Unless otherwise described in this Quarterly Report, reference to “restricted” common stock means that the shares have not been registered and are restricted from resale pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Cash and Working Capital
We have incurred negative cash flows from operations since inception. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $29,281,674 and working capital of $276,916.
