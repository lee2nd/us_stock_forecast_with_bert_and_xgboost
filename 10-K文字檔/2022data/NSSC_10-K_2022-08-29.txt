Our net sales were $143.6 million, $114.0 million and $101.4 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The change in our net sales was driven primarily by increased sales of our recurring services ($12.1 million) and sales of equipment ($17.5 million) as compared to the same period a year ago. The increase in equipment sales was due primarily to the recovery from the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the elimination of most of the closures mandated by federal and state governments during the early and peak stages of the pandemic. As these closures abated and economic conditions improved, our equipment sales increased. In addition, fiscal 2022 net sales increased due, in part, to an increase in sales of the Company’s cellular radio products as the major cellular providers sunset their 3G networks. Our net income was $19.6 million, $15.4 million and $7.8 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increases in net income during this period were due primarily to the recovery from the COVID-19 impact described above, as well as by the growth of our cellular products and the associated recurring revenue business.
Economic and Other Factors
We are subject to the effects of general economic and market conditions. If the U.S. or international economic conditions deteriorate, our revenue, profit and cash-flow levels could be materially adversely affected in future periods. In the event of such deterioration, many of our current or potential future customers may experience serious cash flow problems and as a result may, modify, delay or cancel purchases of our products. Additionally, customers may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed to us. If such events do occur, they may result in our fixed and semi-variable expenses becoming too high in relation to our revenues and cash flows.
Seasonality
The Company's fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30. Historically, the end users of the Company’s hardware products want to install these products prior to the summer; therefore, sales of these products historically peak in the period April 1 through June 30, the Company's fiscal fourth quarter, and are reduced in the period July 1 through September 30, the Company's fiscal first quarter. In addition, demand for all of our products may be affected by the housing and construction markets. Deterioration of the current economic conditions may also affect this trend.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Company’s significant accounting policies are fully described in Note 1 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in its 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes these critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.
For product sales, the Company typically transfers control at a point in time upon shipment or delivery of the product. For monthly communication services, the Company satisfies its performance obligation as the services are rendered overt the course of the month and therefore recognizes revenue over the monthly period.
Typically timing of revenue recognition coincides with the timing of invoicing to the customers, at which time the Company has an unconditional right to consideration. As such, the Company typically records a receivable when revenue is recognized.
The contract with the customer states the final terms of the sale, including the description, quantity, and price of each product purchased. Payment for product sales is typically due within 30 and 180 days of the delivery date. Payment for monthly communication services is billed on a monthly basis and is typically due at the beginning of the month of service or in 30 days for customers with an open account.
The Company provides limited standard warranty for defective products, usually for a period of 24 to 36 months. The Company accepts returns for such defective products as well as for other limited circumstances. The Company also provides rebates to customers for meeting specified purchasing targets and other coupons or credits in limited circumstances. The Company establishes reserves for the estimated returns, rebates and credits and measures such variable consideration based on the expected
value method using an analysis of historical data. Changes to the estimated variable consideration in subsequent periods are not material.
The Company analyzes product sales returns and is able to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns based on the Company’s past history. Estimates for sales returns are based on several factors including actual returns and based on expected return data communicated to it by its customers. Accordingly, the Company believes that its historical returns analysis is an accurate basis for its allowance for sales returns. Actual results could differ from those estimates. As a percentage of gross sales, sales returns, rebates and allowances were 10%, 10% and 9% for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Reserve for Doubtful Accounts
An entity is more vulnerable to concentrations of credit risk if it is exposed to risk of loss greater than it would have had if it mitigated its risk through diversification of customers. The Company had one customer with an accounts receivable balance that comprised 22%, 19% and 24% of the Company’s accounts receivable at June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sales to this customer did not exceed 10% of net sales during fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020. The Company had another customer with an accounts receivable balance that comprised 11% of the Company’s accounts receivable at June 30, 2021. Sales to this customer did not exceed 10% of net sales in any of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company had another customer with an accounts receivable balance that comprised 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable at June 30, 2020. Sales to this customer did not exceed 10% of net sales in any of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company had another customer with an accounts receivable balance that comprised 16% and 12% of the Company’s accounts receivable at June 30, 2022 and 2021. Sales to this customer did not exceed 10% of net sales in any of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
In the ordinary course of business, we have established a reserve for doubtful accounts and customer deductions in the amount of $243,000 and $226,000 as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our reserve for doubtful accounts is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings. This reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable agings, specific exposures and historical or anticipated events.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The reported net value of inventory includes finished saleable products, work-in-process and raw materials that will be sold or used in future periods. Inventory costs include raw materials, direct labor and overhead. The Company’s overhead expenses are applied based, in part, upon estimates of the proportion of those expenses that are related to procuring and storing raw materials as compared to the manufacture and assembly of finished products. These proportions, the method of their application, and the resulting overhead included in ending inventory, are based in part on subjective estimates and actual results could differ from those estimates.
In addition, the Company records an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value. This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends, product life cycle, requirements to support forecasted sales, and the ability to find alternate applications of its raw materials and to convert finished product into alternate versions of the same product to better match customer demand. There is inherent professional judgment and subjectivity made by both production and engineering members of management in determining the estimated obsolescence percentage. In addition, and as necessary, the Company may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events. The Company also regularly reviews the period over which its inventories will be converted to sales. Any inventories expected to convert to sales beyond 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified as non-current.
Long-Lived and Intangible Assets
Long-lived assets are amortized over their useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets in question may not be recoverable. Impairment would be recorded in circumstances where undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset are less than the carrying value of that asset. Intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives were not amortized but were tested for impairment at least annually.
The Company’s acquisition of substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of G. Marks Hardware, Inc. (“Marks”) in August 2008 included intangible assets recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition. The customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives of twenty years. At the acquisition date, the Marks trade name was deemed to have an indefinite life. During the 4th quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company determined that the trade-name was impaired. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1,852,000 and reclassified the remaining balance of the underlying asset from indefinite-lived to a long-lived asset with a remaining useful life of 20 years as of June 30, 2020.
Income Taxes
The Company has identified the United States and New York State as its major tax jurisdictions. Fiscal year 2018 and forward years are still open for examination. In addition, the Company has a wholly-owned subsidiary which operates in a Free Zone in the Dominican Republic (“DR”) and is exempt from DR income tax.
For the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company recognized a net income tax expense of $2,247,000. During the year ending June 30, 2022, the Company increased its reserve for uncertain income tax positions by $25,000. The Company’s practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense and accrued income taxes. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had accrued interest totaling $88,000 and $678,000 of unrecognized net tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the Company’s effective income tax rate in any future period. The Company claims research and development (“R&D”) tax credits on eligible research and development expenditures. The R&D tax credits are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred income tax expense represents the change during the period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company measures and recognizes the tax implications of positions taken or expected to be taken in its tax returns on an ongoing basis.
Leases
Effective July 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new lease accounting standard using the modified retrospective transition option of applying the new standard at the adoption date. In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allowed us to not reassess (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (3) initial direct costs for any existing leases. Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of an operating ROU asset and lease liabilities of approximately $7.7 million. Given the length of the lease term, the right-of-use asset and corresponding liability assume a weighted discount rate as disclosed below. A change in the rate utilized could have a material effect on the amounts reported. Financial positions for reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2019 are presented under new guidance.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
During the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company utilized a portion of its cash generated from operations ($1,563,000 of $8,332,000) to purchase property, plant and equipment ($1,482,000) and marketable securities ($81,000). The Company believes its current working capital, cash flows from operations and its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations through the next twelve months.
As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, long-term debt consisted of a revolving line of credit of $11,000,000 (“Revolver Agreement”), with no amounts outstanding, which expires in June 2024. As of June 30, 2021, the Company had term loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration totaling $3,904,000 through its Payroll Protection Program (“PPP”). The PPP Loans were entirely forgiven during first quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022. The revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants including, among others, restrictions on borrowings and compliance with certain financial ratios, as defined in the agreement. The Company’s long-term debt is described more fully in Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
The Company believes its current working capital, anticipated cash flows from operations and its Revolving Credit Agreement will be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations through at least the next twelve months.
The Company takes into consideration several factors in measuring its liquidity, including the ratios set forth below:
As of June 30, 2022, the Company had no material commitments for capital expenditures or inventory purchases other than purchase orders issued in the normal course of business. On April 26, 1993, the Company's foreign subsidiary entered into a 99-year land lease of approximately 4 acres of land in the Dominican Republic, on which the Company’s principle manufacturing facility is located, at an annual rent of approximately $288,000.
Working Capital. Working capital increased by $17,751,000 to $93,142,000 at June 30, 2022 from $75,391,000 at June 30, 2021. Working Capital increased by $14,939,000 to $75,391,000 at June 30, 2021 from $60,452,000 at June 30, 2020.Working capital is calculated by deducting Current Liabilities from Current Assets.
Accounts Receivable. Accounts Receivable increased by $1,137,000 to $29,218,000 at June 30, 2022 as compared to $28,081,000 at June 30, 2021. The increase in Accounts Receivable was due primarily to an increase in net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the same quarter a year ago. Accounts Receivable increased by $5,149,000 to $28,081,000 at June 30, 2021 as compared to $22,932,000 at June 30, 2020. The increase in Accounts Receivable was due primarily to an increase in net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the same quarter a year ago.
Inventories. Inventories, which include both current and non-current portions, increased by $18,086,000 to $49,786,000 at June 30, 2022 as compared to $31,700,000 at June 30, 2021. The increase was due primarily to higher costs of component parts and freight-in. The increase was also due to the ongoing shortages of certain component parts and the Company purchasing large quantities of these hard to source component parts when they become available. Inventories, which include both current and non-current portions, decreased by $8,715,000 to $31,700,000 at June 30, 2021 as compared to $40,415,000 at June 30, 2020. The decrease was due, in part, to the Company completing the rollout of several new productes that were introduced during fiscal 2020. Inventories of these items were built up during fiscal 2020 in anticipation of initial sotcking orders from the Company’s customers. The decrease in inventory was also due to the Company’s efforts to move closer to “just in time” procurement and production cycles where component parts and finished goods are scheduled for delivery closer to the expected requirement date.
Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses. Accounts payable and accrued expenses, not including income taxes payable, increased by $8,470,000 to $24,625,000 as of June 30, 2022 as compared to $16,155,000 at June 30, 2021. This increase is primarily due to increased purchases of component parts during the quarter ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the same period a year ago as well as an increase in the Company’s accrued refund liability, which is explained in Note 2 to the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounts payable and accrued expenses, not including income taxes payable, increased by $1,684,000 to $16,155,000 as of June 30, 2021 as compared to $14,471,000 at June 30, 2020. This increase is primarily due to an increase in the Company’s accrued refund liability, which is explained in Note 2 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as higher accrued incentive compensation as of June 30, 2021 as compared to June 30, 2020.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Results of Operations
Fiscal 2022 Compared to Fiscal 2021
Net sales in fiscal 2022 increased by $29,558,000 to $143,593,000 as compared to $114,035,000 in fiscal 2021. The increase in net sales was primarily due to increased sales of the Company’s recurring alarm communication services ($12,077,000), Napco brand intrusion products ($11,699,000), Alarm Lock brand door-locking products ($3,136,000), Marks brand door-locking products ($1,533,000) and Continental brand access control products ($1,113,000). The Company’s increase in equipment sales was primarily due to customer demand returning after the decline during the COVID-19 pandemic and the related closures throughout the United States. In addition, fiscal 2022 net sales increased due, in part, to an increase in sales of the Company’s cellular radio products as the major cellular providers sunset their 3G networks.
The Company's gross profit increased by $8,408,000 to $59,156,000 or 41.2% of net sales in fiscal 2022 as compared to $50,748,000 or 44.5% of net sales in fiscal 2021. Gross profit on equipment sales was $19,141,000 or 19.6% of net equipment sales in fiscal 2022 and $21,730,000 or 27.1% of net equipment sales, in fiscal 2021. Gross profit on service revenues was $40,015,000 or 87.0% of net service revenues in fiscal 2022 and $29,018,000 or 85.6% of net service revenues, in fiscal 2021. Gross profit on equipment sales was primarily affected by increased costs of component parts and freight as well as the shift in sales to the Company’s Starlink radio products, which typically have lower margins but result in recurring service revenues.
Research and Development expenses increased by $404,000 to $8,024,000 in fiscal 2022 as compared to $7,620,000 in fiscal 2021. This increase was due primarily to salary increases and additional staff.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2022 increased by $7,711,000 to $32,907,000 as compared to $25,196,000 in fiscal 2021. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 22.9% in fiscal 2022 from 22.1% in fiscal 2021. The increases in dollars and as a percentage of net sales resulted primarily from increases in sales commissions, tradeshow, stock option and legal expenses.
Interest and other expense, net for fiscal 2022 remained relatively constant at $16,000 as compared to $5,000 for the same period a year ago.
Gain on extinguishment of debt resulted from a one-time gain in fiscal 2022 which resulted from the forgiveness of the Company’s PPP loans as described in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section and Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
The Company’s provision for income taxes for fiscal 2022 decreased by $267,000 to $2,247,000 as compared to $2,514,000 for the same period a year ago. The Company’s effective tax rate decreased to 10% for fiscal 2022 as compared to 14% for fiscal 2021. The
decrease in the Company’s fiscal 2022 effective tax rate is primarily due to the $3,904,000 in non-taxable income from extinguishment of debt.
Net income for fiscal 2022 increased by $4,186,000 to $19,599,000 as compared to $15,413,000 in fiscal 2021. This resulted primarily from the items discussed above.
Results of Operations
Fiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020
Net sales in fiscal 2021 increased by $12,676,000 to $114,035,000 as compared to $101,359,000 in fiscal 2020. The increase in net sales was primarily due to increased sales of the Company’s recurring alarm communication services ($9,859,000), Napco brand intrusion products ($5,972,000) and Marks brand door-locking products ($2,051,000), as partially offset by decreased sales of the Company’s Alarm Lock brand door-locking products ($4,720,000) and Continental brand access control products ($191,000). The Company’s increase in equipment sales was primarily due to customer demand returning after the decline during the COVID-19 pandemic and the related closures throughout the United States. This was partially offset by a decrease in the Company’s Alarm Lock products, which was due primarily to school districts and other institutions postponing their capital projects in the latter portion of the Company’s 2020 fiscal year and throughout fiscal 2021.
The Company’s gross profit increased by $7,904,000 to $50,748,000 or 44.5% of net sales in fiscal 2021 as compared to $42,844,000 or 42.3% of net sales in fiscal 2020. Gross profit on equipment sales was $21,730,000 or 27.1% of net equipment sales in fiscal 2021 and $23,132,000 or 29.9% of net equipment sales, in fiscal 2020. Gross profit on service revenues was $29,018,000 or 85.6% of net service revenues in fiscal 2021 and $19,712,000 or 82.0% of net service revenues, in fiscal 2020. Gross profit on equipment sales was primarily affected by the shift in sales to the Company’s Starlink radio products, which typically have lower margins but result in recurring service revenues, and from the Company’s Alarm Lock products as discussed above. The Alarm Lock products are among the Company’s highest margin equipment products. Gross profit on equipment sales was also affected by the Company’s reduction in its production and inventories which impacted it’s overhead absorption rate as well as a decrease in the Company’s reserve for obsolete inventory.
Research and Development expenses increased by $363,000 to $7,620,000 in fiscal 2021 as compared to $7,257,000 in fiscal 2020. This increase was due primarily to salary increases and additional staff.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2021 increased by $1,526,000 to $25,196,000 as compared to $23,670,000 in fiscal 2020. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 22.1% in fiscal 2021 from 23.4% in fiscal 2020. The increase in dollars resulted primarily from increases in employee compensation. The decrease as a percentage of sales
was primarily the result of the increase in net sales as described above, as partially offset by the aforementioned increase in employee compensation expenses.
During the 4th quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company determined that its indefinite-lived intangible asset relating to its Marks USA I subsidiary trade-name was impaired. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1,852,000 and reclassified the remaining balance of the underlying asset from indefinite-lived to a long-lived asset with a remaining useful life of 20 years as of June 30, 2020. There was no impairment charge for the year ended June 30, 2021.
Interest and other expense, net for fiscal 2021 remained relatively constant at $5,000 as compared to $9,000 for the same period a year ago.
The Company’s provision for income taxes for fiscal 2021 increased by $253,000 to $2,514,000 as compared to $2,261,000 for the same period a year ago. The Company’s effective tax rate decreased to 14% for fiscal 2021 as compared to 21% for fiscal 2020. The decrease in the Company’s fiscal 2021 effective tax rate is a direct result of additional tax expense recorded in fiscal 2020 for the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit of the Company’s 2016 fiscal year.
Net income for fiscal 2021 increased by $7,618,000 to $15,413,000 as compared to $7,795,000 in fiscal 2020. This resulted primarily from the items discussed above.
