Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Results of Operations
Introduction
The financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company was recently formed and has not established sufficient operations or revenues to sustain the Company. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The following table provides selected financial data about our Company at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:
To date, the Company has relied on debt and equity raised in private offerings to finance operations and no other source of capital has been identified or sought. If we experience a shortfall in operating capital we could be faced with having to limit our research and development and marketing activities.
Year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to year ended December 31, 2020
Revenues. We had no revenues during the years ended December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.
Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses during year ended December 31, 2021 were $1,000, as compared to $3,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Research and development expenses reflect continuing development work on the Company’s prototype robotic system at its facilities at UCF’s incubator in Orlando, Florida.
Compensation Expense. We had compensation expense of $947,237 and $812,190 during year ended 2021 and 2020 respectively. This includes compensation for the management staff and stock-based compensation expense related to the Company’s 2016 Stock Incentive Plan.
General and Administrative Expenses. We incurred $458,801 in general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $287,737 for the year ended December 31, 2020. General and administrative expenses include legal and other professional expenses related to the Company’s filings as a public company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
Other Income (Expenses). We have earned $118 during year ended 2021 as compared to a net negative of $(21,754) during 2020. The net negative number for 2020 is primarily attributable to investment loss, offset in part by forgiveness of a PPP loan.
Net Loss. We incurred a net loss of $(1,484,313) for 2021 as compared to a net loss of $(1,124,681) for 2020. The increase in net loss from 2021 to 2020 is primarily a result of the increase in General and administrative expenses and compensation expenses.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company expects to require substantial funds for research and development, to continue to develop its initial proposed medical robotic system. The Company plans to meet its operating cash flow requirements by raising additional funds from the sale of our securities and, if possible, on favorable terms, by entering into development partnerships to assist the Company with its technology development activities.
During the period from inception (February 4, 2015) through December 31, 2019, the Company raised (a) $1,900 from an initial private offering of its common stock in February 2017; (b) $480,000 from the private offering of the convertible notes completed in June 2017; (c) $135,000 from a private offering of 135,000 shares of common stock at a price of $1.00 per share completed in February 2017; (d) $542,260 from a private offering of 433,808 shares of stock in a private offering at a price of $1.25 per share completed in September 2017; and (e) $20,000 from the private sale of 16,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $1.25 per share in August 2018.
In March 2019, the Company sold 7.5 Units in a private offering of ten (10) units (“Units”), each Unit consisting of a $10,000 principal amount six-month promissory note bearing interest at the rate of 5% per annum and a three-year warrant to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.25 per share.
In addition to the foregoing, from December 2018 thru October 2020, the Company obtained sixteen loans from Barry F. Cohen, our Chief Executive Officer totaling $497,700. The loans were due 12 months from funding date and did not bear interest. With the exception of two loans totaling $145,000, all of these loans were subsequently repaid in full via conversions into restricted company shares or Units including one loan for $100,000 which was used to exercise a stock option for 1,000,000 shares held by Mr. Cohen.
On October 26, 2020, AVRA issued an aggregate 256,027 Units (“Units”) at a price of $1.00 per Unit in a private offering (the “Offering”) to four “accredited investors.” Each Unit consisted of (a) four shares of our common stock (“Shares”); (b) a three-year warrant to purchase five Shares at an exercise price of $0.40 per Share; and (c) a put option of their Membership Units in Avra Air LLC for one share of our common stock. As a result of the foregoing, the investors were issued an aggregate of 1,024,108 Shares, warrants to purchase 1,280,135 Shares and put options for 256,027 Shares.
On December 22, 2020 one accredited investor and the CEO invested $25,000 and $202,700, respectively, into 227,700 Units at a price of $1.00 per Unit in a private offering (the “Offering”). Each Unit consisted of (a) four shares of our common stock; and (b) a three-year warrant to purchase five Shares at an exercise price of $0.40 per Share. As a result of the foregoing, they were issued an aggregate of 910,800 Shares, and warrants to purchase 1,138,500 Shares. The CEO used a total of $202,700 of Notes due to him from the Company to purchase these Units.
On February 10, 2020, AVRA issued an aggregate 235,000 Units (“Units”) at a price of $1.00 per Unit in a private offering (the “Offering”) to four “accredited investors.” Each Unit consisted of (a) four shares of our common stock (“Shares”); (b) a three-year warrant to purchase five Shares at an exercise price of $0.40 per Share. As a result of the foregoing, the investors were issued an aggregate of 940,000 Shares.
Between October 5, 2021 and December 8, 2021 the Company sold a total of 2,229,231 shares of common stock at prices ranging between $0.13 and $0.52 per share. The Company received proceeds of $315,200.
While we have been successful in raising funds to fund our operations since inception and we believe that we will be successful in obtaining the necessary financing to fund our operations going forward, we do not have any committed sources of funding and there are no assurances that we will be able to secure additional funding. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, if the efforts noted above are not successful, it would raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we cannot obtain financing, then we may be forced to further curtail our operations or consider other strategic alternatives. Even if we are successful in raising the additional financing, there is no assurance regarding the terms of any additional investment and any such investment or other strategic alternative would likely substantially dilute our current shareholders.
Critical Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates included deferred revenue, costs incurred related to deferred revenue, the useful lives of property and equipment and the useful lives of intangible assets.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, as clarified by ASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws. Deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year. In providing for deferred taxes, the Company considers tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, estimates of future taxable income, and available tax planning strategies. If tax regulations, operating results or the ability to implement tax-planning strategies vary, adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required. Valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the “more likely than not” criteria of ASC 740.
ASC 740-10 requires that the Company recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the “more-likely-than-not” threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
