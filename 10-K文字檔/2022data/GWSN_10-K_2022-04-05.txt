Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Forward-Looking Statements
This annual report contains certain information that may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. While we have specifically identified certain information as being forward-looking in the context of its presentation, we caution you that all statements contained in this report that are not clearly historical in nature, including statements regarding anticipated financial performance, management’s plans and objectives for future operations, business prospects, market conditions, and other matters are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are contained principally in the sections of this report entitled “Business,” “Risk Factors,” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, any time we use the words “expects,” “intends,” “will,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “confident,” “continue,” “propose,” “seeks,” “could,” “may,” “should,” “estimates,” “forecasts,” “might,” “goals,” “objectives,” “targets,” “planned,” “projects,” and similar expressions, we intend to clearly express that the information deals with possible future events and is forward-looking in nature. However, the absence of these words or similar expressions does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. For GWSN, particular uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements include, without limitation:
·
our ability to maintain and grow our existing customer base;
·
the amount and timing of our cash flows and earnings, which may be impacted by customer, competitive, supplier and other dynamics and conditions;
·
our ability to maintain or improve margins through business efficiencies;
·
our ability to launch new product and service offerings that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins;
·
changes in law, economic and financial conditions, including tax law changes, changes to privacy requirements, changes to telemarketing, email marketing and similar consumer protection laws, interest and exchange rate volatility, and trade tariffs applicable to the products we sell;
·
the impact of potential information technology, cybersecurity or data security breaches.
Forward-looking information involves risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in, or reasonably inferred from, such statements, including without limitation, the risks and uncertainties disclosed above. Therefore, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Much of the information in this report that looks toward future performance of our Company is based on various factors and important assumptions about future events that may or may not actually occur. As a result, our operations and financial results in the future could differ materially and substantially from those we have discussed in the forward-looking statements included in the Annual Report. We assume no obligation (and specifically disclaim any such obligation) to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.
Business Overview

Recent Development
Reverse Stock Split
On March 29, 2022, the Company filed an amendment to its Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, effective as of 12:01 am on April 1, 2022, whereby each 200 currently outstanding share of the Common Stock shall be combined and converted into one (1) share of Common Stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). Following the Reverse Stock Split, the Company will have approximately 23,091 shares of Common Stock outstanding and an additional 499,976,909 shares of Common Stock available for issuance. In addition, the authorized shares of common stock were increased from 475,000,000 shares to 500,000,000 shares and the authorized shares of preferred stock were increased from 25,000,000 shares to 50,000,000 shares, of which 635,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, one (1) share of Series C Preferred Stock and 1,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock are outstanding.
Results of Operations
Years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
We had revenue of $9,980 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $11,690 for year ended December 31, 2020 a decrease of $1,710 or 15%. The decrease in revenue was due to a lesser concentration on new alarm system sales and installations, with our focus moving more toward alarm system monitoring and the corresponding recurring monthly revenue (“RMR”) that is associated with monitoring services.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue sold for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $3,641, as compared to $4,339 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
General and Administrative
Our general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $385,474, a decrease of $288,465, or 14%, compared to $673,939 for the year ended December 30, 2020. General and administrative expenses decreased mainly due to decrease in legal expenses from $223,559 in 2020 to minimal amount in 2021.
Sales and marketing
Our sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $0, compared to $26 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Minimal sales and marketing expenses reflected management’s decision to shift its focus from retail to wholesale alarm operations.
Income from discontinued operations
Subsequent to the Merger, management decided to discontinue the activities of NuLife. As a result, we recorded an income of $99,775 primarily due to a change in the fair value of a derivative liability.
Net loss
As a result of the foregoing, for the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a net loss of $291,471 compared to a net loss of $791,860 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has limited commercial experience and had a net loss from continuing operations of $391,246 for the year ended December 31, 2021, and an accumulated deficit of $3,371,331, and a working capital deficit of $3,008,869 at December 31, 2021. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company’s cash resources will likely be insufficient to meet its anticipated needs during the next twelve months. The Company will require additional financing to fund its future planned operations, including research and development and commercialization of its products.
Operating Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we used $147,367 of cash in operating activities primarily as a result of our loss of $291,471 from continuing operations, offset by net changes in working capital items of operating assets and liabilities of $144,104.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we used $566,186 of cash in operating activities primarily as a result of our loss of $791,860 from continuing operations, offset by net changes in working capital items of operating assets and liabilities of $225,674.
Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, financing activities provided $147,270 in proceeds from a bridge loan and used $1,767 in net payments to advances from related party.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, financing activities provided $656,116 in proceeds from a bridge loan, provided $5,019 in proceeds from advances from related party and used $20,010 in net payments to redemption of preferred stock.
