For purposes of the following discussion, the words “Seacoast,” or the “Company,” refer to the combined entities of Seacoast Banking Corporation of Florida and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries.
Overview - Strategy and Results
Seacoast Banking Corporation of Florida (“Seacoast” or the “Company”), a financial holding company, registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”), is one of the largest community banks in Florida, with $9.7 billion in assets and $8.1 billion in deposits as of December 31, 2021. Its principal subsidiary is Seacoast National Bank (“Seacoast Bank”), a wholly owned national banking association. The Company provides integrated financial services including commercial and consumer banking, wealth management, and mortgage services to customers through advanced online and mobile banking solutions, and Seacoast Bank's network of 54 traditional branches and commercial banking centers. Seacoast operates primarily in Florida, with concentrations in the state's fastest growing markets, each with unique characteristics and opportunities. The Company's offices stretch from the southeast, including Fort Lauderdale, Boca Raton and Palm Beach, north along the east coast to the Daytona area, into Orlando and Central Florida and the adjacent Tampa market, and west to
Okeechobee and surrounding counties. In the first quarter of 2022, the footprint has expanded to include Naples, Sarasota, and Jacksonville.
The Company delivers integrated banking services, combining traditional retail locations with online and mobile technology and a convenient telephone banking center. Seacoast has built a fully integrated distribution platform across all channels to provide customers with the ability to choose their path of convenience to satisfy their banking needs, allowing the Company an opportunity to reach customers through a variety of sales channels. The Company believes its digital delivery and products are contributing to the franchise's growth.
Seacoast is executing a balanced growth strategy, combining organic growth with strategic acquisitions in Florida's most attractive growing markets. In Orlando, Seacoast is now the largest Florida-based bank and a top-10 bank in the Orlando market overall. In other key markets, including Palm Beach County, Fort Lauderdale, and Tampa, the Company has enhanced its footprint with 13 acquisitions since 2014, generating continued expansion and strengthening market share, increasing the customer base and lowering operating costs through economies of scale.
The Company's acquisition strategy has not only increased customer households and been accretive to earnings, but has also opened markets and Seacoast's customer base. The table below summarizes acquisition activity in recent years:
Impact of COVID-19, the CARES Act and the Paycheck Protection Program on Comparability Among Periods
The COVID-19 pandemic and related responses taken by governments, businesses and individuals have caused unprecedented uncertainty, volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity in the United States and globally, including the markets that we serve. The impact of the economic downturn caused by the pandemic was experienced differently across geographic areas, business sectors and demographic groups. The Florida economy has experienced positive trends including population growth and lower unemployment than much of the rest of the country. While the overall economic outlook has improved, there continues to be the risk of further resurgence of infections, including from variants, and possible reimplementation of business restrictions.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act encouraged financial institutions to provide loan modifications to assist borrowers financially impacted by COVID-19. Seacoast began offering payment accommodations to eligible borrowers in March 2020 and, at June 30, 2020, loans with active payment accommodations peaked at $1.1 billion. Nearly all such modifications have expired and borrowers returned to making payments under the original loan terms. At
December 31, 2021 and 2020, loans with active payment accommodations totaled $1.2 million and $74.1 million, respectively. In 2020, uncertainty related to the impact of the pandemic on the economy and on borrowers’ ability to repay loan obligations resulted in increases in the provisioning for credit losses during 2020. As the overall economic outlook has improved and loan portfolio credit indicators have remained strong, the Company has reduced the level of allowance for credit losses in 2021 compared to 2020. The future effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic activity remain uncertain, and future additional provisions for credit losses could be necessary.
The CARES Act also included provisions for the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) offered through the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”). Loans originated under this program have a contractual rate of interest of 1% with principal and interest that may be forgiven provided that the borrower uses the funds in a manner consistent with PPP guidelines. Seacoast assisted borrowers with nearly 9,000 loans originated through the PPP. The SBA established a fee structure based on loan size, and fees received by Seacoast, net of related costs, totaled $26.7 million, which were deferred and are being recognized as an adjustment to yield over time. During 2020, Seacoast recognized net fees of $7.8 million and contractual interest of $4.2 million on PPP loans. During 2021, Seacoast recognized net fees of $17.5 million and contractual interest of $3.8 million on PPP loans. PPP loan balances outstanding at December 31, 2021 totaled $91.1 million, and the remaining $2.4 million in deferred PPP loan fees will be recognized over the loans' remaining contractual maturity or sooner, as loans are forgiven.

Results of Operations
Earnings Summary
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net income totaled $124.4 million, or $2.18 per diluted share, compared to $77.8 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Return on average assets (“ROA”) was 1.33% and return on average equity (“ROE”) was 10.24% in 2021 compared to 0.99% and 7.44%, respectively, in 2020.
Adjusted net income1 for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $135.0 million, or $2.36 per diluted share, compared to $89.0 million, or $1.65 per diluted share, in 2020.
During 2020, uncertainty related to the impact of COVID-19 resulted in increased provisioning for credit losses. A strong economic recovery in the state of Florida as well as an improving economic outlook have resulted in a release of reserves throughout 2021.
In 2021, the Company's efficiency ratio, defined as noninterest expense less foreclosed property expense and amortization of intangibles divided by net operating revenue (net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis plus noninterest income excluding securities gains and losses), was 55.39%, compared to 54.84% for 2020. Changes from the prior year reflect higher 2021 expenses, resulting from organic and acquisition related expansion of the Company's footprint and investments in commercial banking talent, partially offset by lower funding costs and increases in noninterest income. The adjusted efficiency ratio1 in 2021 was 52.59% compared to 51.63% in 2020.
Net Interest Income and Margin
Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $276.0 million, increasing $13.3 million, or 5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Net interest income (on a fully taxable equivalent basis)1 for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $276.5 million, increasing $13.3 million, or 5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2021 and 2020, net interest margin (on a fully tax equivalent basis)1 was 3.27% and 3.65%, respectively.
The continued low interest rate environment during 2021 resulted in lower yields on securities and non-PPP loans. Yield on securities contracted by 72 basis points from 2.33% to 1.61% while the yield on non-PPP loans declined 33 basis points from 4.62% to 4.29% as higher yielding securities and loans paid down and were replaced with lower yielding assets. Yield on PPP loans increased from 2.86% to 5.57% resulting from loan forgiveness during the year. The effect on net interest margin of interest and fees from PPP loans was an increase of 11 basis points in 2021 compared to a decrease of 3 basis points in 2020. The effect on net interest margin of purchase discounts on acquired loans was an increase of 15 basis points in 2021 compared to 21 basis points in 2020.
The cost of deposits decreased by 24 basis points to 8 basis points in 2021, reflecting the impact of the continued low interest rate environment as well as a shift in product mix to include a higher proportion of noninterest bearing demand deposits to total deposits.
The following table details the Company’s average balance sheets, interest income and expenses, and yields and rates1, for the past three years:
1 Non-GAAP measure - see “Explanation of Certain Unaudited Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information and a reconciliation to GAAP.
The following table shows the impact of value and rate on earning assets and interest bearing liabilities1:
Total average loans increased $72.3 million, or 1%, during 2021 compared to 2020. Average loans (the highest yielding component of earning assets) as a percentage of average earning assets totaled 68% in 2021, compared to 79% in 2020. Loans secured by commercial real estate represented 53% of total loans, excluding PPP loans, at December 31, 2021, compared to 52% at December 31, 2020. Residential loan balances with individuals (including home equity loans and lines and personal construction loans) represented 26% of total loans, excluding PPP loans, at December 31, 2021, compared to 28% at December 31, 2020 (see “Loan Portfolio”).
Average debt securities increased $565.4 million, or 44%, from 2020 reflecting the investment of excess liquidity into the securities portfolio. Securities comprised 22% and 18% of average earning assets in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Yields on securities decreased from 2.33% in 2020 to 1.61% in 2021.
Loan production is detailed in the following table for the periods specified:
Commercial and commercial real estate loan production in 2021 totaled $1.1 billion, compared to $655.8 million in 2020. Included in 2021 are $36.4 million in fixed-rate commercial real estate loans acquired through the wholesale market. The combination of economic expansion and a focus on building the leading commercial bank in Florida with the addition of top talent resulted in significant growth in loan production during 2021.
Residential loan production totaled $887.4 million in 2021, compared to $638.6 million in 2020. Included in 2021 are purchases of $219.2 million in residential loans from the wholesale market. No purchases were made in the wholesale market during 2020.
Consumer originations totaled $249.5 million during 2021, compared to $219.3 million during 2020.
Seacoast originated $256.0 million in PPP loans during 2021 and $599.0 million in 2020. No additional PPP originations are expected.
In 2021, the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities decreased 37 basis points to 0.16% from 2020, reflecting the impact of the continued low interest rate environment as well as a shift in product mix to include a higher proportion of noninterest bearing demand deposits to total deposits. The low overall cost of funding reflects the Company’s successful core deposit focus that produced strong growth in customer relationships over the past several years. Noninterest bearing demand deposits at December 31, 2021 represented 38% of total deposits, compared to 33% at December 31, 2020. The cost of average total deposits (including noninterest bearing demand deposits) in 2021 was 0.08%, compared to 0.32% in 2020.
The following table details the Company's customer relationship funding as of:
The Company’s focus on convenience, with high-quality customer service, expanded digital offerings and distribution channels provides stable, low-cost core deposit funding. Over the past several years, the Company has strengthened its retail deposit franchise using new strategies and product offerings, while maintaining a focus on growing customer relationships. Seacoast believes that digital product offerings are central to core deposit growth and have proved to be of meaningful value to its customers. Seacoast's call center and retail associates continue to lead the market in availability and customer service standards, with the call center out-performing large bank call center wait times and service level standards. The impact of various government stimulus programs, as well as the acquisition of Legacy Bank of Florida in the third quarter of 2021, have also contributed to higher deposit balances. During 2021, average transaction deposits (noninterest and interest bearing demand deposits) increased $1.2 billion, or 35%, compared to 2020.
Growth in core deposits has also provided low funding costs. The Company’s deposit mix remains favorable, with 92% of average deposit balances comprised of savings, money market, and demand deposits in 2021.
Sweep repurchase agreements with customers increased $2.0 million, or 2%, to $121.6 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $119.6 million at December 31, 2020. The average rate on customer repurchase accounts was 0.12% in 2021 compared to 0.33% in 2020. No federal funds purchased were utilized at December 31, 2021 or 2020.
The Company had no FHLB borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2021 or at December 31, 2020. FHLB borrowings averaged $139.4 million at an average rate of 1.10% for the full year 2020 (see “Note 9 - Borrowings” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements).
In 2021, average subordinated debt of $71.5 million related to trust preferred securities issued by subsidiary trusts of the Company carried an average cost of 2.36%, down from 3.07% in 2020, reflecting the impact of lower interest rates as the subordinated debt cost is based on LIBOR plus a spread (see “Note 9 - Borrowings”).
Provision for Credit Losses
The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $9.4 million for the full year 2021 compared to a provision of $38.2 million for the full year 2020. The provision in 2021 reflects an improved economic outlook compared to heightened uncertainty in 2020 relating to the impact of COVID-19 on the economic environment. On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASC Topic 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. Under the CECL approach, the Company reserves for the full amount of expected credit losses over the life of the loans, which also contributed to the increase in provision in 2020.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income (excluding securities gains and losses) totaled $71.3 million in 2021, an increase of $11.0 million, or 18%, compared to 2020. Noninterest income accounted for 21% of total revenue in 2021 and 19% in 2020 (net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding securities gains and losses).
Noninterest income is detailed as follows:
Service charges on deposits for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $0.3 million, or 4%, to $9.8 million. This increase reflects a return to more normalized fee activity compared to the prior year, in part due to the waiver of certain account charges during the first half of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Overdraft fees on business and consumer accounts represented 41% of total service charges on deposits in 2021 compared to 44% in 2020.
Interchange revenue totaled $16.2 million in 2021, an increase of 18% from $13.7 million in 2020. Growth in the number of commercial and consumer customers, targeted marketing campaigns and a continued economic recovery all contributed to higher transaction volume and per-card spending for both consumer and commercial customers for the year.
Wealth management revenues, including brokerage commissions and fees and trust income, increased $2.1 million, or 28%, to $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The wealth management team has continued to grow relationships, resulting in an increase in assets under management of 42% year-over-year to $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2021.
Mortgage banking fees decreased by $2.9 million, or 20%, to $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. The prior year results benefited from a significant decrease in interest rates which resulted in a strong refinance market, while 2021 results reflect a slowdown in refinance activity and lower housing inventory.
Gains on sale of the guaranteed portion of SBA loans totaled $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $0.8 million compared to 2020. PPP loan production ended in the second quarter of 2021, resulting in a shift back to SBA borrowing in the second half of 2021.
Bank owned life insurance (“BOLI”) income totaled $4.2 million in 2021, an increase of $0.6 million, or 17%, compared to the prior year. The Company purchased or added through bank acquisition $69.1 million in BOLI in 2021.
Income from the Company's investments in Small Business Investment Companies (“SBICs”) increased by $5.4 million to $6.8 million compared to 2020. The amounts recognized on SBIC investments will vary amongst periods.
Other income increased by $2.1 million year-over-year, reflecting $1.7 million from the resolution of contingencies on two loans acquired in 2017, and the sale of an internet domain name for $0.8 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in loan swap fees.
Securities losses in 2021 totaled $0.6 million, resulting from a $0.4 million net loss on the sale of debt securities with a fair value of $102.1 million, and a $0.2 million decrease in the value of the CRA-qualified mutual fund investment. Securities gains in 2020 totaled $1.2 million, resulting from net gains on the sale of $96.7 million of debt securities, and a $0.1 million increase in the value of the CRA-qualified mutual fund investment.
Noninterest Expense
The Company has demonstrated its commitment to efficiency through disciplined, proactive management of its cost structure. Noninterest expenses in 2021 totaled $197.4 million and included acquisition-related expenses of $7.9 million, and expenses related to branch consolidation and other expense reduction initiatives of $2.2 million. In 2020, noninterest expenses totaled
$185.6 million, including $9.1 million in acquisition-related expenses, $0.8 million in expenses related to branch consolidation and other expense reduction initiatives, and $0.3 million in bonuses to retail associates for keeping critical functions operating at full capacity through the initial stages of the Company's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjusted noninterest expense1 in 2021 totaled $182.4 million, an increase of 8% from 2020, reflecting overall growth of the organization. Changes in the categories of noninterest expense for the year ended 2021 compared to 2020 are further described below.
Salaries and wages totaled $97.3 million in 2021, an increase of $8.7 million, or 10%, compared to 2020. Results in 2021 include $2.6 million in bank acquisition-related charges compared to $2.8 million in 2020. The remaining increase compared to the prior year reflects higher salaries from headcount added through acquisitions and investments made to support organic growth.
During 2021, employee benefit costs, which include costs associated with the Company's self-funded health insurance benefits, 401(k) plan, payroll taxes, and unemployment compensation, increased $2.3 million, or 15%, compared to 2020. The increase reflects the impact of higher health insurance related costs and payroll taxes resulting from headcount added through acquisitions and investments made to support organic growth.
The Company utilizes third parties for core data processing systems. Ongoing data processing costs are directly related to the number of transactions processed and the negotiated rates associated with those transactions. Outsourced data processing costs totaled $19.9 million in 2021, an increase of $0.9 million, or 5%. Results include $0.9 million in acquisition-related charges compared to $2.7 million in 2020. Investments in 2021 included improvements to the digital commercial loan origination platform that has provided a quicker renewal process and a streamlined workflow for bankers and underwriters, and an automated PPP forgiveness solution integrated with the Company's existing technology infrastructure. The Company continues to improve and enhance mobile and digital products and services through key third parties, and in the first quarter of 2022 upgraded its online and mobile banking platform, providing an enhanced digital experience for customers. Outsourced data processing costs may increase in the future as customers adopt improved products and as business volumes grow.
Telephone and data line expenses, including electronic communications with customers, between branch locations and personnel, and with third party data processors, increased by $0.2 million in 2021 to $3.2 million.
Total occupancy, furniture and equipment expenses in 2021 totaled $19.5 million, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 2%, compared to 2020. The Company continues to evolve its branch footprint in order to redirect capacity into attractive growth markets. In alignment with this strategy, four banking center locations were consolidated in 2021, and two new branches opened.
In 2021 and 2020, marketing expenses totaled $4.6 million and $4.8 million, respectively. The Company continues to carefully manage the use of marketing campaigns to target potential high value customers in a cost effective manner through a mix of digital communications, direct mail, event sponsorships and donations.
Legal and professional fees increased by $2.2 million in 2021, or 24%, to $11.4 million, which includes $3.5 million in merger-related expenses in 2021, compared to $2.7 million in 2020.
FDIC assessments were $2.4 million in 2021, compared to $1.3 million in 2020. Expenses in the prior year were partially offset by $0.7 million in FDIC deposit insurance assessment credits.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, foreclosed property expenses were more than offset by net gains on sale, resulting in a benefit of $0.3 million, compared to foreclosed property expense and net losses on sale of $2.3 million in 2020. Results in 2021 were the result of gains on the sale of OREO properties, while the prior year was impacted primarily by the write-downs of two properties.
Other expense totaled $16.3 million and $15.8 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase of $0.5 million, or 3%, includes higher loan production-related expenses.
Income Taxes
In 2021, the provision for income taxes totaled $34.3 million, compared to $22.8 million in 2020. The increase reflects higher pre-tax income and is partially offset by a temporary reduction in the corporate state tax rate in 2021 to 3.535% compared to 4.5% for 2020. The state tax rate increased to 5.5% effective January 1, 2022, resulting in an additional tax benefit of $0.8 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021 upon the adjustment of the value of deferred tax assets affected by the change. Discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation were $0.9 million in 2021 and $0.1 million in 2020.
Fourth Quarter Results and Analysis
Net income totaled $36.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $13.4 million, or 58%, from the third quarter of 2021, and an increase of $7.0 million, or 24%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.

Included in the fourth quarter was a gain of $0.8 million on the sale of a website domain name obtained in a prior bank acquisition, and an increase of $0.7 million in SBIC investment income compared to the third quarter of 2021. These increases were offset by lower mortgage banking fees, which decreased by $0.5 million, due to slowing refinance activity and continuing low housing inventory levels, and lower SBA gains, which decreased by $0.6 million due to lower saleable production.
Noninterest expenses for the fourth quarter of 2021 totaled $50.3 million, a decrease of $5.0 million, or 9% from the prior quarter and an increase of $6.6 million, or 15%, from the fourth quarter of 2020.

Explanation of Certain Unaudited Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This report contains financial information determined by methods other than Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). The financial highlights provide reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted financial measures including net income, fully taxable equivalent net interest income, noninterest income, noninterest expense, tax adjustments, net interest margin and other financial ratios. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of the Company’s performance and believes these presentations provide useful supplemental information, and a clearer understanding of the Company’s performance. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures enhance investors’ understanding of the Company’s business and performance and if not provided would be requested by the investor community. These measures are also useful in understanding performance trends and facilitate comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. The limitations associated with operating measures are the risk that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items comprising these measures and that different companies might define or calculate these measures differently. The Company provides reconciliations between GAAP and these non-GAAP measures. These disclosures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP.
The following tables provide reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted (non-GAAP) financial measures.
Financial Condition
Total assets increased $1.3 billion, or 16%, year-over-year to $9.7 billion at December 31, 2021, reflecting a combination of organic growth and acquisitions, partially offset by PPP forgiveness.
Securities
Information related to yields, maturities, carrying values and fair value of the Company’s securities is set forth in Tables 7 and 8 and “Note 3 - Securities” of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
At December 31, 2021, the Company had $1.6 billion in securities available-for-sale, and $638.6 million in securities held-to-maturity. The Company's total debt securities portfolio increased $700.3 million, or 44%, from December 31, 2020.
During the first quarter of 2021, the Company reclassified debt securities with an amortized cost of $210.8 million from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity. These securities had net unrealized gains of $0.8 million at the date of transfer, which will continue to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized over the remaining life of the securities as an adjustment of yield. The effect on interest income of the amortization of net unrealized gains is offset by the amortization of the premium on the securities transferred. The Company has the intent and ability to retain these securities until maturity.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, there were $1.5 billion of debt security purchases and $679.3 million in paydowns and maturities over the same period. For the year ended December 31, 2021, debt securities with a fair value of $102.1 million were sold with net losses of $0.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, there were $830.3 million of debt security purchases and $379.9 million in paydowns and maturities over the same period. For the year ended December 31, 2020, debt securities with a fair value of $96.7 million were sold with net gains of $1.1 million.
Debt securities generally return principal and interest monthly. The modified duration of the securities portfolio at both December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was 3.8 years.
At December 31, 2021, available-for-sale securities had gross unrealized losses of $20.9 million and gross unrealized gains of $11.5 million, compared to gross unrealized losses of $2.1 million and gross unrealized gains of $28.7 million at December 31, 2020. The Company assesses securities in an unrealized loss position on a quarterly basis. As of December 31, 2021, the Company expected to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities and therefore no allowance for credit losses was recorded.
The credit quality of the Company’s securities holdings are primarily investment grade. U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agencies and obligations of U.S. government-sponsored entities totaled $1.9 billion, or 82%, of the total portfolio.
The portfolio includes $88.1 million, with a fair value of $88.8 million, in private label residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. Included are $63.0 million, with a fair value of $63.1 million, in private label mortgage-backed residential securities with weighted average credit support of 28%. The collateral underlying these mortgage investments includes both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans. Non-guaranteed agency commercial securities total $25.1 million, with a fair value of $25.7 million. These securities have weighted average credit support of 12%. The collateral underlying these mortgages are primarily pooled multifamily loans.
The Company also has invested $292.7 million in uncapped 3-month LIBOR floating rate collateralized loan obligations. Collateralized loan obligations are special purpose vehicles that purchase first lien broadly syndicated corporate loans while providing support to senior tranche investors. As of December 31, 2021, all of the Company's collateralized loan obligations were in AAA/AA tranches with average credit support of 32%. The Company utilizes credit models with assumptions of loan level defaults, recoveries, and prepayments to evaluate each security for potential credit losses. The result of this analysis did not indicate expected credit losses.
Held-to-maturity securities consist solely of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations guaranteed by government agencies.
At December 31, 2021, the Company has determined that all debt securities in an unrealized loss position are the result of both broad investment type spreads and the current interest rate environment. Management believes that each investment will recover any price depreciation over its holding period as the debt securities move to maturity, and management has the intent and ability to hold these investments to maturity, if necessary. Therefore, at December 31, 2021, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded.
Loan Portfolio
Loans, net of unearned income and excluding the allowance for credit losses, were $5.9 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $189.7 million, or 3%, compared to December 31, 2020. Increases reflect organic growth, along with the acquisition of Legacy Bank of Florida and the purchase of select loan pools, offset by PPP forgiveness. During the first half of 2021, the Company participated in the second round of the PPP program, resulting in originations of $256.0 million. Increases were offset by $777.6 million in PPP loans forgiven by the SBA during the year ended December 31, 2021. In the third quarter of 2021, the Company successfully completed the acquisition of Legacy Bank of Florida, resulting in the addition of $477.2 million in loans.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company originated $1.1 billion in commercial and commercial real estate loans, compared to $655.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $482.0 million, or 73%. The late-stage pipeline for commercial and commercial real estate loans totaled $397.8 million at December 31, 2021. Prior year's production and pipeline reflect the impact of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic where the Company purposefully slowed originations. The current year activity reflects the Company's return to its pre-pandemic credit policy and continuation of strict underwriting guidelines.
The Company originated $245.4 million in residential loans retained in the portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to originations of $129.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $116.2 million, or 90%. Residential loans retained in the portfolio includes a $180.8 million purchased pool consisting of 30-year fixed rate jumbo residential loans purchased in the third quarter of 2021 and a $38.4 million purchased pool consisting of 30-year jumbo rate residential loans purchased in the second quarter of 2021. Saleable production decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021, representing $422.8 million versus $509.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of 17%.
The Company originated $249.5 million consumer loans during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $219.3 million originated in the year ended December 31, 2020.
The Company remains committed to sound risk management procedures. Lending policies contain guardrails that pertain to lending by type of collateral and purpose, along with limits regarding loan concentrations and the principal amount of loans. The Company's exposure to commercial real estate lending remains well below regulatory limits (see “Loan Concentrations”).
The following table details loan portfolio composition at December 31, 2021 and 2020 for portfolio loans, purchased credit deteriorated loans (“PCD”) and loans purchased which are not considered credit deteriorated (“Non-PCD”) as defined in “Note 4 - Loans”.
The amortized cost basis of loans at December 31, 2021 included net deferred costs of $31.0 million on non-PPP portfolio loans and net deferred fees of $2.4 million on PPP loans. At December 31, 2020, the amortized cost basis included net deferred costs of $22.6 million on non-PPP portfolio loans and net deferred fees of $9.5 million on PPP loans. At December 31, 2021, the remaining fair value adjustments on acquired loans was $23.1 million, or 2.3% of the outstanding acquired loan balances. At December 31, 2020, the remaining fair value adjustments on acquired loans was $30.2 million, or 2.9% of the acquired loan balances. These amounts are accreted into interest income over the remaining lives of the related loans on a level yield basis.
Commercial real estate (“CRE) loans, inclusive of owner-occupied commercial real estate, increased $397.0 million, or 16%, totaling $2.9 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to December 31, 2020. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans represent $1.2 billion, or 41%, of the commercial real estate portfolio.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company participated in the most recent round of the PPP and originated 2,782 loans totaling $256.0 million. Also during the year ended December 31, 2021, $777.6 million in PPP loans were forgiven by the SBA.
At December 31, 2021, Seacoast had $1.2 million of loans with payment accommodations to borrowers financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, none of which have been classified as TDRs, compared to $74.1 million at December 31, 2020.
Residential mortgage loans increased $82.7 million, or 6%, year-over-year to $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2021. Substantially all residential originations have been underwritten to conventional loan agency standards, including loans having balances that exceed agency value limitations. At December 31, 2021, approximately $278.9 million, or 20%, of the Company’s residential mortgage balances were adjustable 1-4 family mortgage loans (including hybrid adjustable rate mortgages). Fixed rate mortgages totaled $773.7 million, or 54%, of the residential mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2021, of which 15- and 30-year mortgages totaled $37.1 million and $399.6 million, respectively. Remaining fixed rate balances were comprised of home improvement loans totaling $373.1 million, most with maturities of 10 years or less. Home equity lines of credit (“HELOCs”), primarily floating rates, totaled $336.6 million at December 31, 2021. Borrowers in the residential real estate portfolio have an average credit score of 749. Specifically for HELOCs, borrowers have an average credit score of 763. The average LTV of our HELOC portfolio is 69% with 42% of the portfolio being in the first lien position at December 31, 2021, compared to an average LTV of 68% with 45% of the portfolio being in the first lien position at December 31, 2020.
The Company also provides consumer loans, which include installment loans, auto loans, marine loans and other consumer loans, which decreased $14.6 million, or 8%, year-over-year to a total of $174.2 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $188.7 million at December 31, 2020. Borrowers in the consumer portfolio have an average credit score of 734.
At December 31, 2021, the Company had unfunded commitments to make loans of $2.0 billion, compared to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2020 (see “Note 15 - Contingent Liabilities and Commitments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements).
Loan Concentrations
The Company has developed prudent guardrails to manage loan types that are most impacted by stressed market conditions in order to minimize credit risk concentration to capital. Outstanding balances for commercial and commercial real estate (“CRE”) loan relationships greater than $10 million totaled $1.2 billion, representing 20% of the total portfolio at December 31, 2021, compared to $753.7 million, or 13%, at December 31, 2020.
The Company’s ten largest commercial and commercial real estate funded and unfunded loan relationships at December 31, 2021 aggregated to $312.0 million, of which $157.8 million was funded, compared to $254.3 million at December 31, 2020, of which $188.0 million was funded. The Company had 174 commercial and commercial real estate relationships in excess of $5 million totaling $1.9 billion, of which $1.4 billion was funded at December 31, 2021, compared to 135 relationships totaling $1.3 billion at December 31, 2020, of which $1.2 billion was funded.
Concentrations in total construction and land development loans and total CRE loans are maintained well below regulatory limits. Construction and land development and CRE loan concentrations as a percentage of total risk based capital, were 21% and 177%, respectively, at December 31, 2021, compared to 26% and 169% as of December 31, 2020. Regulatory guidance suggests limits of 100% and 300%, respectively. On a consolidated basis, construction and land development and commercial real estate loans represent 19% and 162%, respectively, of total consolidated risk based capital. To determine these ratios, the Company defines CRE in accordance with the guidance on “Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending” (the “Guidance”) issued by the federal bank regulatory agencies in 2006 (and reinforced in 2015), which defines CRE loans as exposures secured by land development and construction, including 1-4 family residential construction, multifamily property, and non-farm nonresidential property where the primary or a significant source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property (i.e. loans for which 50 percent or more of the source of repayment comes from third party, non-affiliated, rental income) or the proceeds of the sale, refinancing, or permanent financing of the property. Loans to real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) and unsecured loans to developers that closely correlate to the inherent risks in CRE markets would also be considered CRE loans under the Guidance. Loans on owner-occupied CRE are generally excluded. In addition, the Company is subject to a geographic concentration of credit because it primarily operates in Florida.
Nonperforming Loans, Troubled Debt Restructurings, Other Real Estate Owned, and Credit Quality
Table 6 provides certain information concerning nonperforming assets for the years indicated.
Nonperforming assets (“NPAs”) at December 31, 2021 totaled $44.2 million, a decrease of $4.6 million, or 9.5%, compared to 2020, and were comprised of $30.6 million of nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned (“OREO”) of $13.6 million that includes $1.4 million of branches taken out of service. Compared to December 31, 2020, nonaccrual loans decreased by $5.5 million, or 15%, and non-branch OREO increased $2.0 million, or 20%, due to $2.5 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by writedowns of $0.4 million. Approximately 76% of nonaccrual loans were secured with real estate at December 31, 2021. Nonaccrual loans have been written down by approximately $7.1 million, including reserves on individually evaluated loans.
Nonperforming loans to total loans outstanding at December 31, 2021 decreased to 0.52% from 0.63% at December 31, 2020. Nonperforming assets to total assets at December 31, 2021 decreased to 0.46% from 0.59% at December 31, 2020.
The Company’s asset mitigation staff handles all foreclosure actions together with outside legal counsel.
The Company pursues loan restructurings in selected cases where it expects to realize better values than may be expected through traditional collection activities. The Company has worked with retail mortgage customers, when possible, to achieve lower payment structures in an effort to avoid foreclosure. Troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) have been a part of the Company’s loss mitigation activities and can include rate reductions, payment extensions and principal deferrals. Company policy requires TDRs that are classified as nonaccrual loans after restructuring remain on nonaccrual until performance can be verified, which usually requires six months of performance under the restructured loan terms. Accruing restructured loans totaled $3.9 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $4.2 million at December 31, 2020. Accruing TDRs are excluded from nonperforming asset ratios.
Beginning in March 2020, in response to the economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company offered short-term payment deferrals to affected borrowers. As of December 31, 2021, pandemic-related accommodations totaled $1.2 million and are not considered troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”).
The table below sets forth details related to nonaccrual and accruing restructured loans.
At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, total TDRs (performing and nonperforming) were comprised of the following loans by type of modification:
During the year ended December 31, 2021, 12 loans totaling $0.8 million were modified to a TDR, compared to ten loans totaling $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Loan modifications are not reported in calendar years after modification if the loans were modified at an interest rate equal to the yields of new loan originations with comparable risk and the loans are performing based on the terms of the restructuring agreements. There was one default totaling $0.2 million on loans that had been modified in TDRs within the twelve months preceding December 31, 2021, and there were no defaults on loans that had been modified in TDRs within the twelve months preceding December 31, 2020. A restructured loan is considered in default when it becomes 90 days or more past due under the modified terms, has been transferred to nonaccrual status, or has been transferred to OREO.
In accordance with regulatory reporting requirements, loans are placed on nonaccrual following the Retail Classification of Loan interagency guidance. The accrual of interest is generally discontinued on loans, except consumer loans, that become 90 days past due as to principal or interest unless collection of both principal and interest is assured by way of collateralization, guarantees or other security. Consumer loans that become 120 days past due are generally charged off. The loan carrying value is analyzed and any changes are appropriately made as described above quarterly.
Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans
Management estimates the allowance using relevant available information, from both internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit losses provide the basis for
estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, loan to value ratios, borrower credit characteristics, loan seasoning or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates, property values, occupancy rates, and other macroeconomic metrics.
The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a provision of $37.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The prior year reflected the impact of economic uncertainty attributed primarily to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The removal of lockdown restrictions and a continued improvement in the economic outlook are reflected in the decrease in provisioning in 2021. Net charge-offs for 2021 were $3.0 million, or 0.06% of average loans, excluding PPP loans, compared to $7.6 million, or 0.14%, for 2020. Excluding PPP loans, the ratio of allowance to total loans decreased to 1.43% at December 31, 2021 from 1.79% at December 31, 2020.
Activity in the allowance for credit losses is summarized as follows:
Concentrations of credit risk, discussed under the caption “Loan Portfolio” of this discussion and analysis, can affect the level of the allowance and may involve loans to one borrower, an affiliated group of borrowers, borrowers engaged in or dependent upon the same industry, or a group of borrowers whose loans are predicated on the same type of collateral. At December 31, 2021, the Company's largest concentrations of credit risk were $2.9 billion in loans secured by commercial real estate and $1.4 billion in loans secured by residential real estate, representing 50% and 24% of total loans outstanding, respectively. In addition, the Company is subject to a geographic concentration of credit because it primarily operates in Florida.
LIBOR Transition
The Company’s LIBOR transition steering committee is responsible for overseeing the execution of the Company’s enterprise-wide LIBOR transition program, and for evaluating and mitigating risks associated with the transition from LIBOR. The LIBOR transition program includes a comprehensive review of the financial products, agreements, contracts, and business processes that may use LIBOR as a reference rate, and the development and execution of strategy to transition away from LIBOR, with appropriate consideration of the potential financial, customer, counterpart, regulatory and legal impacts. The Company continues to execute its LIBOR transition program, and to monitor regulatory and legislative activity to identify any necessary actions and facilitate the transition to alternative reference rates.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company has ceased issuance of new LIBOR loans, and has approximately $250 million in existing loans for which the repricing index is tied to LIBOR. The Company's swap agreements and other derivatives are governed by the International Swap Dealers Association (“ISDA”). ISDA has developed fallback language for swap agreements and has established a protocol to allow counterparties to modify legacy trades to include the new fallback language. The Company also invests in securities and has issued subordinated debt tied to LIBOR. The Company continues to monitor regulatory and legislative activity with regard to these products to identify and execute necessary actions to facilitate the transition to alternative reference rates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents, Liquidity Risk Management and Contractual Commitments
Liquidity risk involves the risk of being unable to fund assets with the appropriate duration and rate-based liability, as well as the risk of not being able to meet unexpected cash needs. Liquidity planning and management are necessary to ensure the ability to fund operations cost effectively and to meet current and future potential obligations such as loan commitments and unexpected deposit outflows.
Funding sources include primarily customer-based deposits, collateral-backed borrowings, brokered deposits, cash flows from operations, cash flows from our loan and investment portfolios and asset sales, primarily secondary marketing for residential real estate mortgages and marine loans. Cash flows from operations are a significant component of liquidity risk management and the Company considers both deposit maturities and the scheduled cash flows from loan and investment maturities and payments when managing risk.
Deposits are a primary source of liquidity. The stability of this funding source is affected by numerous factors, including returns available to customers on alternative investments, the quality of customer service levels, perception of safety and competitive forces. The Company routinely uses debt securities and loans as collateral for secured borrowings. In the event of severe market disruptions, the Company has access to secured borrowings through the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta under its borrower-in-custody program.
The Company does not rely on and is not dependent on off-balance sheet financing or significant amounts of wholesale funding. Brokered deposits at December 31, 2021 totaled $8.0 million, compared to $430.4 million at December 31, 2020.
Cash and cash equivalents, including interest bearing deposits, totaled $737.7 million on a consolidated basis at December 31, 2021, compared to $404.1 million at December 31, 2020. Higher cash and cash equivalent balances at December 31, 2021 are primarily the result of growth in deposits.
Contractual maturities for assets and liabilities are reviewed to meet current and expected future liquidity requirements. Sources of liquidity, both anticipated and unanticipated, are maintained through a portfolio of high-quality marketable assets, such as residential mortgage loans, available-for-sale debt securities and interest-bearing deposits. The Company is also able to provide short-term financing of its activities by selling, under an agreement to repurchase, United States Treasury and government agency debt securities not pledged to secure public deposits or trust funds. At December 31, 2021, the Company had available unsecured lines of $165.0 million and lines of credit under current lendable collateral value, which are subject to change, of $1.6 billion. In addition, the Company had $1.9 billion of debt securities and $614.2 million in residential and commercial real estate loans available as collateral. In comparison, at December 31, 2020, the Company had available unsecured lines of $135.0 million and lines of credit of $1.8 billion, and $1.2 billion of debt securities and $733.3 million in residential and commercial real estate loans available as collateral.
The Company has traditionally relied upon dividends from Seacoast Bank and securities offerings to provide funds to pay the Company’s expenses and to service the Company’s debt. During 2021, Seacoast Bank distributed $47.7 million to the Company and, at December 31, 2021, is eligible to distribute dividends to the Company of approximately $221.8 million without prior regulatory approval. Seacoast Bank distributed $20.2 million to the Company during 2020. At December 31, 2021, the Company had cash and cash equivalents at the parent of approximately $57.0 million compared to $70.1 million at December 31, 2020.
The following table presents contractual obligations by remaining maturity. All deposits presented in the table with indeterminate maturities such as interest bearing and noninterest bearing demand deposits, savings accounts and money market accounts are presented as having a maturity of one year or less. The Company considers these low cost deposits to be its largest, most stable funding source, despite no contracted maturity.
Deposits and Borrowings
The Company’s balance sheet continues to be primarily funded by core deposits.
Total deposits increased $1.1 billion, or 16%, to $8.1 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. The increase reflects growth in existing customer balances, the addition of new customers and the impact of the Legacy Bank of Florida acquisition which added $494.9 million in deposits during 2021.
Since December 31, 2020, interest bearing deposits, which includes interest bearing demand, savings and money markets deposits, increased $625.5 million, or 16%, to $4.4 billion at December 31, 2021, noninterest bearing demand deposits increased $785.7 million, or 34%, to $3.1 billion, and CDs decreased $276.2 million, or 33%, to $554.9 million. Noninterest demand deposits represented 38% of deposits at December 31, 2021 and 33% at December 31, 2020. Transaction account balances (noninterest demand and interest-bearing demand) increased to 62% of total deposits at December 31, 2021 compared to 56% at December 31, 2020.
Time deposits over $250,000 were $150.3 million and $171.5 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The following table details the maturities of time deposits of $250,000 and greater at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020:
Total uninsured deposits were estimated to be $3.2 billion at December 31, 2021.
Customer repurchase agreements totaled $121.6 million at December 31, 2021, increasing $2.0 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2020. Repurchase agreements are offered by Seacoast to select customers who wish to sweep excess balances on a daily basis for investment purposes. The increase reflects higher overall balances held by existing customers in 2021. Public funds comprise a significant amount of the outstanding balance.
The Company participates in programs with third party deposit networks as part of its liquidity management strategy. Through these programs, the Company can offer its customers access to FDIC insurance on large balances, and the Company can retain or sell, on an overnight basis, the underlying deposits. At December 31, 2021, and had sold, on an overnight basis, $228.0
million in deposits compared to $112.7 million at December 31, 2020. These deposits are not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
No unsecured federal funds purchased were outstanding at December 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020.
Borrowings were comprised of $71.6 million and $71.4 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, related to trust preferred securities issued by trusts organized or acquired by the Company, and there were no borrowings from FHLB.
The Company issued subordinated debt in conjunction with its wholly owned trust subsidiaries in connection with bank acquisitions in previous years. The acquired junior subordinated debentures (in accordance with ASC Topic 805 Business Combinations) were recorded at fair value, which collectively is $3.5 million lower than face value at December 31, 2021. This amount is being amortized into interest expense over the acquired subordinated debts’ remaining term to maturity. All trust preferred securities are guaranteed by the Company on a junior subordinated basis.
Under Basel III and Federal Reserve rules, qualified trust preferred securities and other restricted capital elements can be included as Tier 1 capital, within limitations. The Company believes that its trust preferred securities qualify under these capital rules. The weighted average interest rate of our outstanding subordinated debt related to trust preferred securities was 2.36% for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 3.07% in 2020.
Go to “Note 9 - Borrowings” to the Company's consolidated financial statements for more detailed information pertaining to borrowings.
Off-Balance Sheet Transactions
In the normal course of business, the Company may engage in a variety of financial transactions that, under generally accepted accounting principles, either are not recorded on the balance sheet or are recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that differ from the full contract or notional amounts. These transactions involve varying elements of market, credit and liquidity risk.
Lending commitments include unfunded loan commitments and standby and commercial letters of credit. For loan commitments, the contractual amount of a commitment represents the maximum potential credit risk that could result if the entire commitment had been funded, the borrower had not performed according to the terms of the contract, and no collateral had been provided. A large majority of loan commitments and standby letters of credit expire without being funded, and accordingly, total contractual amounts are not representative of our actual future credit exposure or liquidity requirements. Loan commitments and letters of credit expose the Company to credit risk in the event that the customer draws on the commitment and subsequently fails to perform under the terms of the lending agreement.
For commercial customers, loan commitments generally take the form of revolving credit arrangements. For retail customers, loan commitments are generally lines of credit secured by residential property. These instruments are not recorded on the balance sheet until funds are advanced under the commitment. Loan commitments were $2.0 billion at December 31, 2021, and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2020 (see “Note 15 - Contingent Liabilities and Commitments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements).
In the normal course of business, the Company and Seacoast Bank enter into agreements, or are subject to regulatory agreements that result in cash, debt and dividend restrictions. A summary of the most restrictive items follows:
Seacoast Bank may be required to maintain reserve balances with the Federal Reserve Bank. There was no reserve requirement at December 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020.
Under Federal Reserve regulation, Seacoast Bank is limited as to the amount it may loan to its affiliates, including the Company, unless such loans are collateralized by specified obligations. At December 31, 2021, the maximum amount available for transfer from Seacoast Bank to the Company in the form of loans approximated $100.2 million, if the Company has sufficient acceptable collateral. There were no loans made to affiliates during the periods ending December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Capital Resources and Management
Table 1 summarizes the Company’s capital position and selected ratios.
The Company's equity capital at December 31, 2021 increased $180.3 million, or 16%, from December 31, 2020, to $1.3 billion. Changes in equity included increases from net income and the issuance of equity in conjunction with the acquisition of Legacy Bank of Florida, partially offset by the issuance of common stock dividends and the decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income primarily attributed to the decrease in market value of available-for-sale securities.
The ratio of shareholders’ equity to period end total assets was 13.54% and 13.55% at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The ratio of tangible shareholders’ equity to tangible assets was 11.09% and 11.01% at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
Activity in shareholders’ equity for the year ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 follows:
Capital ratios are well above regulatory requirements for well-capitalized institutions. Management’s use of risk-based capital ratios in its analysis of the Company’s capital adequacy are not GAAP financial measures. Seacoast’s management uses these measures to assess the quality of capital and believes that investors may find it useful in their analysis of the Company. The capital measures are not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures that may be presented by other companies and Seacoast does not nor should investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for GAAP financial information (see “Table 1 - Capital Resources” and “Note 13 - Shareholders’ Equity”).
The Company’s total risk-based capital ratio was 18.21% at December 31, 2021, a decrease from 18.51% at December 31, 2020. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted interagency guidance that delays the impact of CECL adoption on capital for two years followed by a three-year phase-in period. As of December 31, 2021, the Bank’s leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets) was 10.65%, compared to 11.03% at December 31, 2020, well above the minimum to be well capitalized under regulatory guidelines.
The Company and Seacoast Bank are subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The appropriate federal bank regulatory authority may prohibit the payment of dividends where it has determined that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice. The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from Seacoast Bank and its other subsidiaries, and the Company’s primary source of cash and liquidity, other than securities offerings and borrowings, is dividends from its bank subsidiary. Without Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) approval, Seacoast Bank can pay up to $221.8 million of dividends to the Company (see “Part I. Item 1. Business”).
The OCC and the Federal Reserve have policies that encourage banks and bank holding companies to pay dividends from current earnings, and have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by national banks and bank holding companies, respectively, if such payment may be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. If, in the particular circumstances, either of these federal regulators determined that the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice, either the OCC or the Federal Reserve may, among other things, issue a cease and desist order prohibiting the payment of dividends by Seacoast Bank or the Company, respectively. Under a recently adopted Federal Reserve policy, the board of directors of a bank holding company must consider different factors to ensure that its dividend level is prudent relative to the organization’s financial position and is not based on overly optimistic earnings scenarios such as any potential events that may occur before the payment date that could affect its ability to pay, while still maintaining a strong financial position. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company, such as Seacoast, should
consult with the Federal Reserve and eliminate, defer, or significantly reduce the bank holding company’s dividends if: (i) its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.
The Company has seven wholly owned trust subsidiaries that issued trust preferred securities, all of which are guaranteed by the Company on a junior subordinated basis. The Federal Reserve’s rules permit qualified trust preferred securities and other restricted capital elements to be included under Basel III capital guidelines, with limitations, and net of goodwill and intangibles. The Company believes that its trust preferred securities qualify under these revised regulatory capital rules and believes that it will be able to treat all $71.6 million of trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital. For regulatory purposes, the trust preferred securities are added to the Company’s tangible common shareholders’ equity to calculate Tier 1 capital.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, (“GAAP”), including prevailing practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments in the application of certain of its accounting policies that involve significant estimates and assumptions. The Company has established policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period. These estimates and assumptions, which may materially affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements, and changes in this information over time and the use of revised estimates and assumptions could materially affect amounts reported in subsequent financial statements. Management, after consultation with the Company’s Audit Committee, believes the most critical accounting estimates and assumptions that involve the most difficult, subjective and complex assessments are:
•the allowance and the provision for credit losses;
•acquisition accounting and purchased loans;
•intangible assets and impairment testing;
•other fair value measurements;
•impairment of debt securities, and;
•contingent liabilities.
The following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies intended to facilitate a reader’s understanding of the judgments, estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies and the possible or likely events or uncertainties known to the Company that could have a material effect on reported financial information. For more information regarding management’s judgments relating to significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements, see “Note A-Significant Accounting Policies” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Allowance for Credit Losses - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASC Topic 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which replaced the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) methodology.
For loans, management estimates the allowance for credit losses using relevant available information, from both internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit losses provide the basis for estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, loan to value ratios, borrower credit characteristics, loan seasoning or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates, property values, occupancy rates, and other macroeconomic metrics.
The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. The Company has developed an allowance model based on an analysis of probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”) to
determine an expected loss by loan segment. PDs and LGDs are developed by analyzing the average historical loss migration of loans to default.
The allowance estimation process also applies an economic forecast scenario over a three year forecast period. The forecast may utilize one scenario or a composite of scenarios based on management's judgment and expectations around the current and future macroeconomic outlook. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. For portfolio segments with a weighted average life longer than three years, the Company reverts to longer-term historical loss experience, adjusted for prepayments, to estimate losses over the remaining life of the loans within each segment.
Adjustments may be made to baseline reserves for some of the loan pools based on an assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality not fully reflected in the quantitative components of the allowance model. These influences may include elements such as changes in concentration, macroeconomic conditions, recent observable asset quality trends, staff turnover, regional market conditions, employment levels and loan growth. Based upon management's assessments of these factors, the Company may apply qualitative adjustments to the allowance.
Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not also included in the collective evaluation. When management determines that foreclosure is probable, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate.
The contractual term of a loan excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modification unless either of the following applies: management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that a troubled debt restructuring will be executed with an individual borrower or the extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and not unconditionally cancellable by the Company.
The allowance for credit losses on troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) is measured using the same method as all other loans held for investment, except when the value of a concession cannot be measured using a method other than the discounted cash flow method. When the value of a concession is measured using the discounted cash flow method, the allowance for credit losses is determining by discounting the expected future cash flows at the original interest rate of the loan.
It is the Company's practice to ensure that the charge-off policy meets or exceeds regulatory requirements. Losses on unsecured consumer loans are recognized at 90 days past due, compared to the regulatory loss criteria of 120 days. In compliance with Federal Financial Institution Examination Council guidelines, secured consumer loans, including residential real estate, are typically charged off or charged down between 120 and 180 days past due, depending on the collateral type. Commercial loans and real estate loans are typically placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest is past due for 90 days or more, unless the loan is both secured by collateral having realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt in-full and the loan is in process of collection. Loans provided with short-term payment deferrals under the CARES Act or interagency guidance are not considered past due if in compliance with the terms of their deferral. Secured loans may be charged down to the estimated value of the collateral with previously accrued unpaid interest reversed against interest income. Subsequent charge-offs may be required as a result of changes in the market value of collateral or other repayment prospects. Initial charge-off amounts are based on valuation estimates derived from appraisals, broker price opinions, or other market information. Generally, new appraisals are not received until the foreclosure process is completed; however, collateral values are evaluated periodically based on market information and incremental charge-offs are recorded if it is determined that collateral values have declined from their initial estimates.
Note 5 to the financial statements (titled “Allowance for Credit Losses”) summarizes the Company’s allocation of the allowance for credit losses on loans by loan segment and provides detail regarding charge-offs and recoveries for each loan segment and the composition of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Acquisition Accounting and Purchased Loans - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Company accounts for acquisitions under ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, are recorded at fair value. All loans acquired are recorded at fair value in accordance with the fair value methodology prescribed in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement. The fair value estimates associated with the loans include estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of expected principal, interest and other cash flows. Loans are identified as purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) when they have experienced more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. An allowance for expected credit losses on PCD loans is recorded at the date of acquisition through an adjustment to the loans’ amortized cost basis. In contrast, expected credit losses on loans not considered PCD are recognized in net income at the date of acquisition.
Fair value estimates for acquired assets and assumed liabilities are based on the information available, and are subject to change
for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition as additional information relative to closing date fair values becomes
available.
Intangible Assets and Impairment Testing - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Intangible assets consist of goodwill, core deposit intangibles and loan servicing rights. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business acquisitions. The core deposit intangible represents the excess intangible value of acquired deposit customer relationships as determined by valuation specialists. Core deposit intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis, and are evaluated for indications of potential impairment at least annually. Goodwill is not amortized but rather is evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis. We performed an annual impairment test of goodwill as required by ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, in the fourth quarter of 2021 and concluded that no impairment existed.
Fair value estimates for acquired assets and assumed liabilities are based on the information available, and are subject to change for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition as additional information relative to closing date fair values becomes available.
Other Fair Value Measurements - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The fair value of collateral-dependent loans, OREO and repossessed assets is typically based on current appraisals, which are reviewed quarterly to determine if fair value adjustments are necessary based on known changes in the market and/or the project assumptions. When necessary, the appraised value may be adjusted based on more recent appraisal assumptions received by the Company on other similar properties, the tax assessed market value, comparative sales and/or an internal valuation. Collateral-dependent loans are loans where repayment is solely dependent on the liquidation of the collateral or operation of the collateral for repayment.
The Company also holds 11,330 shares of Visa Class B stock which, following resolution of Visa’s litigation, will be converted to Visa Class A shares. Under the current conversion rate that became effective December 29, 2021, the Company expects to receive 1.6181 shares of Class A stock for each share of Class B stock, for a total of 18,333 shares of Visa Class A stock. The Company's ownership is related to prior ownership in Visa’s network while Visa operated as a cooperative. This ownership is recorded on the Company's financial records at a zero basis.
Impairment of Debt Securities - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASC Topic 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which requires expected credit losses on both held-to-maturity (“HTM”) and available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities to be recognized through a valuation allowance instead of as a direct write-down to the amortized cost basis of the security. For HTM securities, the guidance requires management to estimate expected credit losses over the remaining expected life and recognize this estimate as an allowance for credit losses. An AFS security is considered impaired if the fair value is less than amortized cost basis. For AFS securities, if any portion of the decline in fair value is related to credit, the amount of allowance is determined as the portion related to credit, limited to the difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the security. If the fair value of the security increases in subsequent periods, or changes in factors used within the credit loss assessment result in a change in the estimated credit loss, the Company would reflect the change by decreasing the allowance. If the Company has the intent to sell or believes it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell an impaired AFS security before recovery of the amortized cost basis, the credit loss is recorded as a direct write-down of the amortized cost basis. Declines in the fair value of AFS securities that are not considered credit related are recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Seacoast analyzes AFS debt securities quarterly for credit losses. The analysis is performed on an individual security basis for all securities where fair value has declined below amortized cost. Fair value is based upon pricing obtained from third party pricing services. Based on internal review procedures and the fair values provided by the pricing services, the Company believes that the fair values provided by the pricing services are consistent with the principles of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement. However, on occasion pricing provided by the pricing services may not be consistent with other observed prices in the market for similar securities. Using observable market factors, including interest rate and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities and default rates, the Company may at times validate the observed prices using a discounted cash flow model and using the observed prices for similar securities to determine the fair value of its securities.
The Company utilizes both quantitative and qualitative assessments to determine if a security has a credit loss. Quantitative assessments are based on a discounted cash flow method. Qualitative assessments consider a range of factors including: percent
decline in fair value, rating downgrades, subordination, duration, amortized loan-to-value, and the ability of the issuers to pay all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms.
Contingent Liabilities - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Seacoast is subject to contingent liabilities, including judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings, and tax and other claims arising from the conduct of the Company's business activities. These proceedings include actions brought against the Company and/or its subsidiaries with respect to transactions in which the Company and/or its subsidiaries acted as a lender, a financial adviser, a broker or acted in a related activity. Accruals are established for legal and other claims when it becomes probable that the Company will incur an expense and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Company management, together with attorneys, consultants and other professionals, assesses the probability and estimated amounts involved in a contingency. Throughout the life of a contingency, the Company or its advisers may learn of additional information that can affect the assessments about probability or about the estimates of amounts involved. Changes in these assessments can lead to changes in recorded reserves. In addition, the actual costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved for the claims. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had no significant accruals for contingent liabilities and had no known pending matters that could potentially be significant.
