Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements of expected future developments, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations and industry that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Our future results and financial condition may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of the factors we describe under “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.”
Among other things, such risks and uncertainties include the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on SunCoke’s results of operations, revenues, earnings and cash flows; SunCoke’s balance sheet and liquidity throughout and following the COVID-19 pandemic; SunCoke’s prospects for financial performance and achievement of strategic objectives following the COVID-19 pandemic; and the general impact on our industry and on the U.S. and global economy resulting from COVID-19 and actions by domestic and foreign governments and others in response thereto.
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is based on financial data derived from the financial statements prepared in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and certain other financial data that is prepared using a non-GAAP measure. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP component, see Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements.
Our MD&A is provided in addition to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our results of operations include reference to our business operations and market conditions, which are further described in Part I of this document.
2021 Overview
Our consolidated results of operations in 2021 were as follows:
(1)See Note 20 in our consolidated financial statements for both the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation from GAAP to the non-GAAP measurement.
The Company successfully delivered against our key objectives in 2021. Our entry into and participation in the export and foundry coke markets, in addition to successful execution on our contracted coke sales, enabled our Domestic Coke facilities to operate at full capacity. This strong Domestic Coke performance along with higher volumes, price realization, and the addition of a new product, iron ore, in our Logistics segment drove record Adjusted EBITDA performance in 2021. Our long-term, take-or-pay coke contracts continue to provide stability to our coke operations, which now also include a new five year take-or-pay contract with Algoma Steel beginning in 2022, with average sales of approximately 150 thousand tons of blast furnace coke per year.
We returned meaningful capital to our shareholders through the declaration and payment of a $0.06 per share dividend during each quarter of 2021. Additionally, we executed a debt refinancing, discussed in further detail below, which allowed us to achieve annual interest rate savings of approximately $17 million and extend our debt maturities significantly. We also reduced total debt by approximately $64 million in 2021.
Items Impacting Comparability
•2021 Debt Refinancing. During the second quarter of 2021, the Company refinanced its debt obligations. The Company issued $500.0 million of 4.875 percent 2029 Senior Notes, amended and extended the maturity of its Revolving Facility to June 2026 and reduced the Revolving Facility capacity by $50.0 million to $350.0 million. The Company used the proceeds of the 2029 Senior Notes along with borrowings under the Company's Revolving Facility to purchase and redeem all of the 7.500 percent 2025 Senior Notes. As a result of the debt
refinancing and revolver amendment, the year ended December 31, 2021 included a loss on extinguishment of debt on the Consolidated Statement of Operations of $31.9 million, which consisted of the premium paid of $22.0 million and the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of $6.9 million and the remaining original issue discount of $3.0 million. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the debt refinancing.
•2020 Customer Contract Amendments. As a result of the market challenges presented by the COVID-19 global pandemic, during 2020 SunCoke executed contract amendments with its steelmaking customers to provide near-term coke supply relief in exchange for extending certain contracts. These customer contract amendments reduced customer contract volumes in 2020 by approximately 500 thousand tons of coke, which reduced 2020 Adjusted EBITDA by approximately $20 million, net of cost savings.
Consolidated Results of Operations
The following section includes year-over-year analysis of consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. See "Analysis of Segment Results" later in this section for further details of these results. Refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-over-year analysis of consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Sales and Other Operating Revenue and Costs of Products Sold and Operating Expenses. Sales and other operating revenue and costs of products sold and operating expenses increased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to higher volumes in our Domestic Coke segment, partially offset by the pass-through of lower coal prices. Higher volumes and favorable pricing in our Logistics segment also increased sales and other operating revenues in 2021 as compared to 2020.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expense primarily reflects lower legacy costs, which decreased $11.3 million in 2021 compared to 2020 as a result of valuation adjustments in both years primarily driven by changes in the discount rates on certain legacy liabilities. Additionally, 2021 benefited from the absence of research and development costs related to foundry coke production of $3.9 million, the absence of $2.5 million of restructuring costs, and the absence of costs to resolve certain legal matters incurred during the prior year. These benefits were partially offset by higher employee related costs.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense was reasonably consistent with the prior year.
Interest Expense, net. Interest expense, net benefited from lower interest rates as a result of the debt refinancing that occurred during the second quarter of 2021 and lower average debt balances on the revolving facility.
Income Taxes. Income tax expense, net during 2021 reflects the impacts of certain changes in state tax laws, resulting in a state tax benefit of $1.3 million. During 2020, income tax expense, net reflects the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets due to lower apportioned state tax rates, which resulted in deferred income tax expense of $6.5 million, partly offset by a $1.5 million benefit as result of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. Excluding these discrete items, SunCoke's effective tax rate has remained reasonably consistent. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
Noncontrolling Interest. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents a 14.8 percent third-party interest in our Indiana Harbor cokemaking facility and fluctuates with the financial performance of that facility.
Results of Reportable Business Segments
We report our business results through three segments:
•Domestic Coke consists of our Jewell facility, located in Vansant, Virginia, our Indiana Harbor facility, located in East Chicago, Indiana, our Haverhill facility, located in Franklin Furnace, Ohio, our Granite City facility located in Granite City, Illinois, and our Middletown facility located in Middletown, Ohio.
•Brazil Coke consists of operations in Vitória, Brazil, where we operate the ArcelorMittal Brazil cokemaking facility.
•Logistics consists of Convent Marine Terminal ("CMT"), located in Convent, Louisiana, Kanawha River Terminal ("KRT"), located in Ceredo and Belle, West Virginia, SunCoke Lake Terminal ("Lake Terminal"), located in East Chicago, Indiana, and Dismal River Terminal ("DRT"), located in Vansant, Virginia. Lake Terminal and DRT are located adjacent to our Indiana Harbor and Jewell cokemaking facilities, respectively.
The operations of each of our segments are described in Part I of this document.
Corporate expenses that can be identified with a segment have been included in determining segment results. The remainder is included in Corporate and Other, including activity from our legacy coal mining business.
Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of operating performance and uses it as the primary basis for the chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of each of our reportable segments. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for the reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. See Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements.
Segment Operating Data
The following table sets forth financial and operating data by segment for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
(1)See Note 20 in our consolidated financial statements for both the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation from GAAP to the non-GAAP measurement for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
(2)Corporate and Other includes the activity from our legacy coal mining business, which incurred Adjusted EBITDA losses of $1.9 million and $13.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Additionally, Corporate and Other includes foundry related research and development costs of $3.9 million during 2020.
(3)Reflects Domestic Coke Adjusted EBITDA divided by Domestic Coke sales volumes.
(4)Reflects inbound tons handled during the period.
Analysis of Segment Results
Historically, SunCoke's analysis of our Domestic Coke segment has aligned with the pass-through nature of our long-term, take-or-pay contracts, including analysis of the prices of coal passed through and the reimbursement of operating maintenance spending as compared to prior year periods. Beginning in 2021, our Domestic Coke business has expanded into the export coke market and the foundry coke market. These sales do not contain the same pass-through provisions as our long-term, take-or-pay contracts. Therefore, the analysis of our Domestic Coke results has evolved to allow for the inclusion of these sales. The impact of fluctuating coal prices, including the value of coal-to-coke yield gains and losses, and indexed operating and maintenance reimbursement rates are now presented as price variances along with the impact of export and foundry sales prices as compared to prior period sales prices.
Domestic Coke
The following table explains year-over-year changes in our Domestic Coke segment's sales and other operating revenues and Adjusted EBITDA results:
(1)Volumes improved in 2021 due to the absence of volume relief provided to our customers in exchange for contract extensions in 2020 as well as our successful entry into and participation in the foundry and export coke markets.
(2)The pass through of lower coal prices on our long-term, take-or-pay agreements resulted in lower revenues. Under recovery of coal costs at our Jewell cokemaking facility decreased Adjusted EBITDA $11.1 million in 2021 as compared to 2020, the impact of which was more than offset by favorable margins on our foundry coke and export coke sales.
(3)Operating and maintenance costs across the fleet returned to a normalized level during 2021. Costs were minimized during 2020 in conjunction with the volume relief discussed above.
(4)Energy and other increased primarily due to favorable energy pricing and higher volumes, which increased with our return to operating our facilities at full capacity in 2021.
Logistics
The following table explains year-over-year changes in our Logistics segment's sales and other operating revenues and Adjusted EBITDA results:
(1)Volumes improved as a result of the improved export coal market as well as the handling of iron ore.
(2)Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA increased as a result of favorable pricing at CMT driven by the strong export coal market.
(3)Other increased as a result of favorable ancillary revenue, which was a result of higher volumes as well as minimal costs incurred in 2021 associated with high water levels at CMT due to abnormal weather patterns.
Brazil Coke
Sales and other operating revenue increased $5.0 million, or 16 percent, to $36.6 million in 2021 compared to $31.6 million in 2020. Adjusted EBITDA increased $3.7 million, or 27 percent, to $17.2 million in 2021 compared to $13.5 million in 2020. The improvements as compared to the prior year reflect higher volumes as well as production bonuses for meeting certain volume targets during the current year.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and Other expenses, which include costs related to our legacy coal mining business, decreased $13.2 million, or 32 percent, to $28.7 million in 2021 as compared to $41.9 million in 2020. This improvement was driven by the absence of foundry related research and development costs of $3.9 million and valuation adjustments as a result of changes in discount rates on certain legacy liabilities, which decreased legacy cost approximately $11.3 million as compared to the prior year. These cost savings were partly offset by higher employee related costs.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary liquidity needs are to fund working capital, fund investments, service our debt, maintain cash reserves and replace partially or fully depreciated assets and other capital expenditures. Our sources of liquidity include cash generated from operations, borrowings under our Revolving Facility and, from time to time, debt and equity offerings. We believe our current resources are sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for our current business for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2021, we had $63.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $228.8 million of borrowing availability under our Revolving Facility.
We may, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase additional amounts of our outstanding equity and/or debt securities through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. Refer to further liquidity discussion below as well as to Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and "Part I - Item 5 - Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholders Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities."
During the first quarter of 2020, the U.S. Department of Labor's Division of Coal Mine Workers' Compensation (“DCMWC”) requested SunCoke provide additional collateral of approximately $32 million to secure certain of its black lung obligations. SunCoke exercised its right to appeal the DCMWC’s determination and provided additional information supporting the Company’s position in May 2020 and February 2021. If the Company’s appeal is unsuccessful, the Company may be required to provide additional collateral to receive its self-insurance reauthorization from the DCMWC, which could potentially reduce the Company’s liquidity. See further discussion in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
Cash Flow Summary
The following table sets forth a summary of the net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $75.3 million to $233.1 million in 2021 as compared to 2020, reflecting higher operating results in both our coke and logistics businesses as well as lower interest payments of $11.8 million, net of capitalized interest, primarily as a result of lower interest rates in connection with the debt refinancing during the second quarter of 2021. Additionally, operating activities reflect certain income tax refunds received during the current year in connection with the CARES act.
Cash Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities increased $24.0 million to $99.3 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 driven by higher capital spending. Ongoing capital expenditures, as defined in Capital Requirements and Expenditures below, have returned to a more normalized level in 2021 as compared to 2020. Restrictions during 2020 related to the COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in a reduction of capital project work and related spending in the prior year.
Cash Used in Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities decreased $12.8 million to $118.4 million in 2021 as compared to $131.2 million in 2020. In 2021, the Company refinanced its debt, further described in Note 6 of our consolidated financial statements, with no significant impact on total debt balances. In conjunction with this refinancing, the Company paid a premium of $22.0 million, included in repayment of long-term debt on the consolidated statement of cash flows, as well as $12.0 million of debt issuance costs. The Company also made net repayments on its debt of $63.5 million and made dividend payments of $20.1 million during 2021.
In 2020, the Company repurchased $62.7 million face value of outstanding 2025 Senior Notes for $55.9 million of cash payment. Additionally, the Company made net repayments of $55.0 million on the Revolving Facility, which was partially offset by $10.0 million of financing obligation proceeds. The Company paid dividends to stockholders of $19.9 million and repurchased shares for total cash payments of $7.0 million under the repurchase program discussed in "Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholders Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities."
Dividends
In addition to the $20.1 million in dividends paid to our shareholders during 2021, on February 1, 2022, SunCoke's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.06 per share of the Company's common stock. This dividend will be paid on March 1, 2022, to stockholders of record of February 17, 2022. See further discussion in "Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholders Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities."
Covenants
As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. We do not anticipate a violation of these covenants nor do we anticipate that any of these covenants will restrict our operations or our ability to obtain additional financing. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for details on debt covenants.
Credit Rating
In June 2021, S&P Global Ratings reaffirmed our corporate credit rating of BB- (stable). In June 2021, Moody’s Investors Service reaffirmed our corporate credit rating of B1 and stable outlook.
Contractual Obligations
As of December 31, 2021 significant contractual obligations related to debt were $627.0 million of principal borrowings and $195.0 million of related interest, which will be repaid through 2029. Projected interest costs on variable rate instruments were calculated using market rates at December 31, 2021. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. We also have contractual obligations for leases, including land, office space, equipment, railcars and locomotives. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.
Capital Requirements and Expenditures
Our operations are capital intensive, requiring significant investment to upgrade or enhance existing operations and to meet environmental and operational regulations. The level of future capital expenditures will depend on various factors, including market conditions and customer requirements, and may differ from current or anticipated levels. Material changes in capital expenditure levels may impact financial results, including but not limited to the amount of depreciation, interest expense and repair and maintenance expense.
Our capital requirements have consisted, and are expected to consist, primarily of:
•Ongoing capital expenditures required to maintain equipment reliability, the integrity and safety of our coke ovens and steam generators and to comply with environmental regulations. Ongoing capital expenditures are made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets in order to maintain the existing operating capacity of the assets and/or to extend their useful lives and also include new equipment that improves the efficiency, reliability or effectiveness of existing assets. Ongoing capital expenditures do not include normal repairs and maintenance expenses, which are expensed as incurred;
•Expansion capital expenditures to acquire and/or construct complementary assets to grow our business and to expand existing facilities as well as capital expenditures made to enable the renewal of a coke sales agreement and/or logistics service agreement and on which we expect to earn a reasonable return; and
•Environmental remediation project expenditures required to implement design changes to ensure that our existing facilities operate in accordance with existing environmental permits.
The following table summarizes our capital expenditures:
(1)Includes capital spending in connection with the foundry cokemaking growth project, including $0.5 million and $0.2 million of interest capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
(2)Reflects actual cash payments during the periods presented for our capital requirements.
Critical Accounting Policies
A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Our management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide the users of our financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions consist of: (1) black lung benefit obligations and (2) accounting for impairments of goodwill and long-lived assets. Although our management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may differ to some extent from the estimates on which our consolidated financial statements have been prepared at any point in time. Despite these inherent limitations, our management believes the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and consolidated financial statements and footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of our financial condition.
Black Lung Benefit Liabilities
The Company has obligations related to coal workers’ pneumoconiosis, or black lung, benefits to certain of its former coal miners and their dependents further described in Note 13.
Our independent actuarial consultants calculate the present value of the estimated black lung liability annually based on actuarial models utilizing our population of former coal miners, historical payout patterns of both the Company and the industry, actuarial mortality rates, medical costs, death benefits, dependents, discount rates and the current federally mandated payout rates. The estimated liability may be impacted by future changes in the statutory mechanisms, modifications by court decisions and changes in filing patterns driven by perceptions of success by claimants and their advisors, the impact of which cannot be estimated.
The following table summarizes discount rates utilized, active claims and the total black lung liabilities:
(1)The discount rate is determined based on a portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities that are consistent with the estimated duration of our black lung obligations. A decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would have increased black lung expense by $1.4 million in 2021.
(2)The current portion of the black lung liability was $5.4 million and $4.6 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and was included in accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The following table summarizes annual black lung payments and expense:
(1)Expenses incurred in excess of annual accretion of the black lung liability in 2020 and 2019 primarily reflect the impact of changes in discount rates as well as increases in expected future claims as a result of higher refiling and approval rate assumptions.
Accounting for Impairments
Goodwill
Goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, is assessed for impairment as of October 1 of each year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit to below its carrying value.
Prior to 2020, a significant portion of our logistics business was from long-term, take-or-pay contracts with Murray American Coal, Inc. ("Murray") and Foresight Energy LLC ("Foresight"), which were adversely impacted by declining coal export prices and domestic demand. Murray filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on October 29, 2019. Foresight engaged outside counsel and financial advisors to assess restructuring options during 2019 and subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on March 10, 2020. Both Murray and Foresight's contracts with CMT were subsequently rejected by the bankruptcy courts.
The Company concluded the impact of the events discussed above could more likely than not reduce the fair value of the Logistics reporting unit below its carrying value, requiring SunCoke to perform its annual goodwill test as of September 30, 2019. The fair value of the Logistics reporting unit, which was determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis, did not exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit. Key assumptions in our goodwill impairment test included reduced forecasted volumes and reduced rates from Foresight, no further business from Murray, incremental merchant business and a discount rate of 12 percent, representing the estimated weighted average cost of capital for this business line. As a result, the Company recorded a $73.5 million non-cash, pretax impairment charge to the Logistics segment on the Consolidated Statements of Operations during 2019, which represents a full impairment of the Logistics goodwill balance. The Company's total goodwill balance at both December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $3.4 million. Please see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.
Long-lived Assets
Long-lived assets are comprised of properties, plants and equipment as well as our long-lived intangible assets, comprised primarily of customer contracts, customer relationships, and permits.
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. A long-lived asset, or group of assets, is considered to be impaired when the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount. Such estimated future cash flows are highly subjective and are based on numerous assumptions about future operations and market conditions. The impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the impaired asset, or group of assets. It is also difficult to precisely estimate fair market value because quoted market prices for our long-lived assets may not be readily available. Therefore, fair market value is generally based on the present values of estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks associated with the assets being reviewed for impairment. No impairments on long-lived assets were recorded in 2021 or 2020. Please see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on long-lived assets.
As a result of our logistics customers' events discussed above, CMT's long-lived assets, including customer contracts, customer relationships, permits and properties, plant and equipment, were also assessed for impairment as of September 30, 2019. The Company re-evaluated its projections for throughput volumes, pricing and customer performance against the existing long-term, take-or-pay contracts. The resulting undiscounted cash flows were lower than the carrying value of the asset group. Therefore, the Company assessed the fair value of the asset group to measure the amount of impairment. The fair value of the CMT long-lived assets was determined to be $112.1 million based on discounted cash flows, asset replacement cost and adjustments for capacity utilization, which are considered Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy as defined in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements. Key assumptions in our discounted cash flows
included reduced forecasted volumes and reduced rates from Foresight, no further business from Murray, incremental merchant business and a discount rate of 11 percent, representing the estimated weighted average cost of capital for this
asset group. As a result, during 2019, the Company recorded a total non-cash, pre-tax long-lived asset impairment charge of $173.9 million included in long-lived asset and goodwill impairment on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, all of which was attributable to the Logistics segment. The charge included an impairment of CMT's long-lived intangible assets of $113.3 million and of CMT's property, plant and equipment of $60.6 million.
Recent Accounting Standards
See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to the GAAP results provided in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have provided a non-GAAP financial measure, Adjusted EBITDA. Our management, as well as certain investors, uses this non-GAAP measure to analyze our current and expected future financial performance. This measure is not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP and may be different from, or inconsistent with, non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. See Note 20 in our consolidated financial statements for both the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation from GAAP to the non-GAAP measurement for 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Guarantor Financial and Non-Financial Disclosures
The Company has an existing shelf registration statement, which was filed on November 8, 2019, upon the expiration of the prior shelf registration statement, for the offering of debt and/or securities on a delayed or continuous basis and is presenting these guarantor financial and non-financial disclosures in connection therewith. The following information has been prepared and presented pursuant to amended SEC Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X and new SEC Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X, which were adopted by the SEC on March 2, 2020.
For purposes of the following information, SunCoke Energy, Inc. is referred to as “Issuer.” All 100 percent owned subsidiaries of the Company are expected to serve as guarantors of obligations (“Guarantor Subsidiaries”) included in the shelf registration statement, other than the Indiana Harbor partnership and certain of the Company’s corporate financing, international and legacy coal mining subsidiaries ("Non-Guarantors"). These guarantees will be full and unconditional (subject, in the case of the Guarantor Subsidiaries, to customary release provisions as described below) and joint and several.
The guarantee of a Guarantor Subsidiary will terminate upon:
•a sale or other disposition of the Guarantor Subsidiary or of all or substantially all of its assets;
•a sale of the majority of the capital stock of a Guarantor Subsidiary to a third-party, after which the Guarantor Subsidiary is no longer a “Restricted Subsidiary” in accordance with the indenture governing the notes;
•the liquidation or dissolution of a Guarantor Subsidiary so long as no “Default” or "Event of Default”, as defined under the indenture governing the notes, has occurred as a result thereof;
•the designation of a Guarantor Subsidiary as an “unrestricted subsidiary” in accordance with the indenture governing the notes;
•the requirements for defeasance or discharge of the indenture governing the notes having been satisfied; or
•the release, other than the discharge through payments by a Guarantor Subsidiary, from other indebtedness that resulted in the obligation of the Guarantor Subsidiary under the indenture governing the notes.
The following tables present summarized financial information for the Issuer and the Guarantor Subsidiaries on a combined basis after intercompany balances and transactions between the Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries have been eliminated and excluding investment in and equity in earnings from the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries
