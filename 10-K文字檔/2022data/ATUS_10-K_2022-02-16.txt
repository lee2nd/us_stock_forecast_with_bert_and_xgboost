In this Item 7, we discuss the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and comparisons of the 2021 results to the 2020 results. Discussions of the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 and comparisons of the 2020 results to the 2019 results can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 as filed on February 12, 2021.
Our Business
We principally provide broadband communications and video services in the United States and market our services primarily under two brands: Optimum, primarily in the New York metropolitan area, and Suddenlink, principally in markets in the south-central United States. We deliver broadband, video, telephony, and mobile services to more than five million residential and business customers. Our footprint extends across 21 states through a fiber-rich hybrid-fiber coaxial ("HFC") broadband network and a FTTH network with approximately 9.3 million total passings as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, we offer news programming and content, advertising services, as well as a full service mobile offering, to consumers across our footprint.
Key Factors Impacting Operating Results and Financial Condition
Our future performance is dependent, to a large extent, on the impact of direct competition, general economic conditions (including capital and credit market conditions), our ability to manage our businesses effectively, and our relative strength and leverage in the marketplace, both with suppliers and customers. For more information, see "Risk Factors" and "Business-Competition" included herein.
In March 2020, the United States declared a national emergency concerning the outbreak of COVID-19. Since then, there have been extraordinary and wide-ranging actions taken by federal, state and local governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of the virus and new variants, including lockdowns, social distancing directives and testing and vaccine mandates. While certain government regulations and mandates have eased and COVID-19 vaccines have become broadly available in certain areas, governmental authorities are continuing to monitor the situation and take carious actions in an effort to slow or prevent an increase in the spread of COVID-19.
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted our business, including how our customers use our products and services and how our employees provide services to our customers. Although the ultimate impact of the pandemic on our business cannot be predicted, and we cannot predict how our future results may be impacted if the pandemic continues, we have and will continue to provide our telecommunications services to our customers and work to adapt the environment in which we operate. See "Risk Factors - Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic."
We derive revenue principally through monthly charges to residential customers of our broadband, video, and telephony services. We also derive revenue from DVR, VOD, pay-per-view, installation and home shopping commissions. Our residential broadband, video, and telephony services accounted for approximately 39%, 35%, and 4%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. We also derive revenue from the sale of a wide and growing variety of products and services to both large enterprise and SMB customers, including broadband, telephony, networking and video services. For the year ended December 31, 2021, 16% of our consolidated revenue was derived from these business services. In addition, we derive revenues from the sale of advertising time available on the programming carried on our cable television systems, digital advertising, branded content, affiliation fees for news programming, and data analytics, which accounted for approximately 5% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our mobile and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 accounted for approximately 1% of our consolidated revenue.
Revenue is impacted by rate increases, changes in the number of customers to our services, including additional services sold to our existing customers, programming package changes by our video customers, speed tier changes by our broadband customers, and acquisitions and construction of cable systems that result in the addition of new customers.
Our ability to increase the number of customers to our services is significantly related to our penetration rates.
We operate in a highly competitive consumer-driven industry and we compete against a variety of broadband, video and telephony providers and delivery systems, including broadband communications companies, wireless data and telephony providers, fiber-based service providers, satellite-delivered video signals, Internet-delivered video content and broadcast television signals available to residential and business customers in our service areas. Our competitors include AT&T and its DirecTV subsidiary, Lumen, DISH, Frontier and Verizon. Consumers' selection of an alternate source of service, whether due to economic constraints, technological advances or preference, negatively impacts the demand for our services. For more information on our competitive landscape, see "Risk Factors" and "Business-Competition" included herein.
Our programming costs, which are the most significant component of our operating expenses, have increased and are expected to continue to increase primarily as a result of contractual rate increases. See "Results of Operations" below for more information regarding the key factors impacting our revenues and operating expenses.
Historically, we have made substantial investments in our network and the development of new and innovative products and other service offerings for our customers as a way of differentiating ourselves from our competitors and we may continue to do so in the future. Our ongoing FTTH network build, with planned upgrades, will enable us to deliver Multi-Gig broadband speeds to meet the growing data needs of residential and business customers. In addition, we launched our full service mobile offering to consumers across our footprint. We may incur greater than anticipated capital expenditures in connection with these initiatives, fail to realize anticipated benefits, experience delays and business disruptions or encounter other challenges to executing them as planned. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources-Capital Expenditures" for additional information regarding our capital expenditures.
Certain Transactions
The following transactions had an impact in the periods covered by this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations:
In June 2021, Lightpath completed an acquisition for a net purchase price of approximately $28,260 and the operating results of the acquired business were consolidated as of the acquisition date.
In April 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of the cable assets of Morris Broadband, LLC ("Morris Broadband") in North Carolina for approximately $312,184 and the operating results of the acquired business were consolidated as of the acquisition date.
In December 2020, the Company completed the sale of a 49.99% interest in its Lightpath fiber enterprise business based on an implied enterprise value of $3,200,000. The Company retained a 50.01% interest in the Lightpath business and maintained control of Lightpath, the entity holding the interest in the Lightpath business. Accordingly, the Company continues to consolidate the operating results of the Lightpath business.
On July 14, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of certain cable assets in New Jersey for approximately $149,973 and the operating results of the acquired business were consolidated as of the acquisition date.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We define Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net income (loss) excluding income taxes, non-operating income or expenses, loss on extinguishment of debt and write-off of deferred financing costs, gain (loss) on interest rate swap contracts, gain (loss) on derivative contracts, gain (loss) on investments and sale of affiliate interests, interest expense, interest income, depreciation and amortization (including impairments), share-based compensation expense or benefit, restructuring expense or credits, and transaction expenses.
We believe Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company. Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry. Internally, we use revenue and Adjusted EBITDA measures as important indicators of our business performance and evaluate management’s effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides management and investors a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business and operating results by excluding items that are not comparable across reporting periods or that do not otherwise relate to the Company’s ongoing operating results. Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), and other measures of performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Since Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies.
We also use Operating Free Cash Flow (defined as Adjusted EBITDA less cash capital expenditures), and Free Cash Flow (defined as net cash flows from operating activities less cash capital expenditures) as indicators of the Company’s financial performance. We believe these measures are two of several benchmarks used by investors, analysts and peers for comparison of performance in the Company’s industry, although they may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.
Results of Operations
The following is a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Free Cash Flow:
The following is a reconciliation of net cash flow from operating activities to Free Cash Flow:
The following table sets forth certain customer metrics for the Company (unaudited):
(a)Represents the estimated number of single residence homes, apartments and condominium units passed by our HFC and FTTH network in areas serviceable without further extending the transmission lines. In addition, it includes commercial establishments that have connected to our HFC and FTTH network. Broadband services were not available to approximately 30 thousand passings and telephony services were not available to approximately 500 thousand passings. Amounts as of December 31, 2021 include approximately 89 thousand total passings that were acquired from Morris Broadband in April 2021.
(b)Represents number of households/businesses that receive at least one of the Company's fixed-line services.
(c)Customers represent each customer account (set up and segregated by customer name and address), weighted equally and counted as one customer, regardless of size, revenue generated, or number of boxes, units, or outlets on our HFC and FTTH network. Free accounts are included in the customer counts along with all active accounts, but they are limited to a prescribed group. Most of these accounts are also not entirely free, as they typically generate revenue through pay-per-view or other pay services and certain equipment fees. Free status is not granted to regular customers as a promotion. In counting bulk residential customers, such as an apartment building, we count each subscribing family unit within the building as one customer, but do not count the master account for the entire building as a customer. We count a bulk commercial customer, such as a hotel, as one customer, and do not count individual room units at that hotel. Amounts as of December 31, 2021 include 37.3 thousand customer relationships (35.1 thousand residential and 2.2 thousand SMB) that were acquired from Morris Broadband in April 2021.
(d)Represents the number of total customer relationships divided by total passings.
(e)Calculated by dividing the average monthly revenue for the respective quarter (fourth quarter for annual periods) derived from the sale of broadband, video and telephony services to residential customers by the average number of total residential customers for the same period.
(f)Customer metrics do not include mobile customers.
(g)Customer metrics as of December 31, 2020 include certain customers impacted by storms in Louisiana that had not yet been disconnected for non-payment (see table below).
(h)ARPU for the December 31, 2020 period reflects a reduction of $1.26 due to credits that we anticipated to be issued to video customers as a result of credits the Company expected to receive from certain sports programming networks whereby the minimum number of events were not delivered pursuant to the contractual agreements with the networks and related franchise fees.
(i)Represents the estimated number of single residence homes, apartments and condominium units passed by the FTTH network in areas serviceable without further extending the transmission lines. In addition, it includes commercial establishments that have connected to our FTTH network.
(j)Represents number of households/businesses that receive at least one of the Company's fixed-line services on our FTTH network.
(k)FTTH customers represent each customer account (set up and segregated by customer name and address), weighted equally and counted as one customer, regardless of size, revenue generated, or number of boxes, units, or outlets on our FTTH network. Free accounts are included in the customer counts along with all active accounts, but they are limited to a prescribed group. Most of these accounts are also not entirely free, as they typically generate revenue through pay-per view or other pay services and certain equipment fees. Free status is not granted to regular customers as a promotion. In counting bulk residential customers, such as an apartment building, we count each subscribing family unit within the building as one customer, but do not count the master account for the entire building as a customer. We count a bulk commercial customer, such as a hotel, as one customer, and do not count individual room units at that hotel.
(l)Represents the number of total FTTH customer relationships divided by FTTH total passings.
Comparison of Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2021 to Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2020
Broadband Revenue
Broadband revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $3,925,089 and $3,689,159, respectively. Broadband revenue is derived principally through monthly charges to residential subscribers of our broadband services. Revenue is impacted by rate increases, changes in the number of customers, including additional services sold to our existing subscribers, and changes in speed tiers. Additionally, the allocation of revenue between the residential offerings is impacted by changes in the standalone selling price of each performance obligation within our promotional bundled offers.
Broadband revenue increased $235,930 (6%) for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due primarily to higher average recurring broadband revenue per broadband customer, primarily driven by certain rate increases and service level changes, and an increase in broadband customers, as well as customer credits issued in 2020 for service outages following certain storms that occurred in 2020.
Video Revenue
Video revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $3,526,205 and $3,670,859, respectively. Video revenue is derived principally through monthly charges to residential customers of our video services. Revenue is impacted by rate increases, changes in the number of customers, including additional services sold to our existing customers, and changes in programming packages. Additionally, the allocation of revenue between the residential offerings is impacted by changes in the standalone selling price of each performance obligation within our promotional bundled offers. Video revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 included estimated credits of approximately $94,300 expected to be issued to customers as a result of $90,100 of credits the Company expected to receive from certain sports programming networks whereby the minimum number of events were not delivered pursuant to the contractual agreements with the networks and related franchise fees (“RSN Credits”).
Video revenue decreased $144,654 (4%) for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was due primarily to a decline in video customers and lower pay-per-view and
video-on-demand revenue. The decrease in video revenue was partially offset by the RSN Credits recorded in 2020, higher average recurring video revenue per video customer, primarily driven by certain rate increases, and customer credits issued in 2020 for service outages following certain storms that occurred in 2020.
Telephony Revenue
Telephony revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $404,813, and $468,777, respectively. Telephony revenue is derived principally through monthly charges to residential customers of our telephony services. Revenue is impacted by changes in rates for services, changes in the number of customers, and additional services sold to our existing customers. Additionally, the allocation of revenue between the residential offerings is impacted by changes in the standalone selling price of each performance obligation within our promotional bundled offers.
Telephony revenue decreased $63,964 (14%) for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was due to a decline in telephony customers and lower average recurring telephony revenue per telephony customer, partially offset by customer credits issued in 2020 for service outages following certain storms that occurred in 2020.
Business Services and Wholesale Revenue
Business services and wholesale revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $1,586,044 and $1,454,532, respectively. Business services and wholesale revenue is derived primarily from the sale of fiber-based telecommunications services to the business market, and the sale of broadband, video and telephony services to SMB customers. Business services and wholesale revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 included estimated RSN Credits of approximately $2,900 expected to be issued to customers.
Business services and wholesale revenue increased $131,512 (9%) for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Approximately $100,100 of the increase in 2021 was due to an early termination of a backhaul contract for air strands that resulted in the recognition of deferred revenue and termination fees over the amended term. The increase was also attributable to higher average recurring broadband revenue per SMB customer, primarily driven by certain rate increases and service level changes, and customer credits issued in 2020 for service outages following certain storms that occurred in 2020 and the RSN customer credits recorded in 2020. The increase in revenue was partially offset by a decrease resulting from lower average recurring telephony revenue per SMB customer and revenue related to an indefeasible right of use contract recorded in the second quarter of 2020.
News and Advertising Revenue
News and advertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $550,667 and $519,205, respectively. News and advertising revenue is primarily derived from the sale of (i) advertising inventory available on the programming carried on our cable television systems, (ii) digital advertising, (iii) branded content, and (iv) data analytics. News and advertising revenue also includes affiliation fees for news programming.
News and advertising revenue increased $31,462 (6%) for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising revenue from non-political linear and non-political digital advertising, partially offset by a decrease in political advertising spending.
Mobile Revenue
Mobile revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $84,194 and $78,127, respectively, and relates to sales of devices and mobile services. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 186 thousand mobile lines as compared to 169 thousand lines as of December 31, 2020.
Other Revenue
Other revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $13,837 and $13,983, respectively. Other revenue includes revenue from other miscellaneous revenue streams.
Programming and Other Direct Costs
Programming and other direct costs for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 amounted to $3,382,129 and $3,340,442, respectively. Programming and other direct costs include cable programming costs, which are costs paid to programmers (net of amortization of any incentives received from programmers for carriage) for cable content (including costs of VOD and pay-per-view) and are generally paid on a per-customer basis. These costs typically rise due to increases in contractual rates and new channel launches and are also impacted by changes in the number of
customers receiving certain programming services. These costs also include interconnection, call completion, circuit and transport fees paid to other telecommunication companies for the transport and termination of voice and data services, which typically vary based on rate changes and the level of usage by our customers. These costs also include franchise fees which are payable to the state governments and local municipalities where we operate and are primarily based on a percentage of certain categories of revenue derived from the provision of video service over our cable systems, which vary by state and municipality. These costs change in relation to changes in such categories of revenues or rate changes. Additionally, these costs include the costs of mobile devices sold to our customers and direct costs of providing mobile services.
The increase of $41,687 (1%) for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to the following:
Programming costs
Programming costs aggregated $2,744,629 and $2,701,145 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Programming costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 included estimated credits of approximately $93,000 that the Company expected to receive from certain sports programming networks whereby the minimum number of events were not delivered pursuant to the contractual agreements with the networks. Our programming costs in 2022 will continue to be impacted by changes in programming rates, which we expect to increase, and by changes in the number of video customers.
Other Operating Expenses
Other operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 amounted to $2,379,765 and $2,264,473, respectively. Other operating expenses include staff costs and employee benefits including salaries of company employees and related taxes, benefits and other employee related expenses, as well as third-party labor costs. Other operating expenses also include network management and field service costs, which represent costs associated with the maintenance of our broadband network, including costs of certain customer connections and other costs associated with providing and maintaining services to our customers.
Customer installation and network repair and maintenance costs may fluctuate as a result of changes in the level of activities and the utilization of contractors as compared to employees. Also, customer installation costs fluctuate as the portion of our expenses that are capitalized changes. Costs associated with the initial deployment of new customer premise equipment necessary to provide broadband, video and telephony services are capitalized (asset-based). The redeployment of customer premise equipment is expensed as incurred.
Other operating expenses also include costs related to our customer care operations that handle customer inquiries and billing and collection activities, and sales and marketing costs, which include advertising production and placement costs associated with acquiring and retaining customers. These costs vary period to period and certain of these costs, such as sales and marketing, may increase with intense competition. Additionally, other operating expenses include various other administrative costs.
The increase in other operating expenses of $115,292 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year was attributable to the following:
Restructuring and Other Expense
Restructuring and other expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 amounted to $17,176, as compared to $91,073 for the year ended December 31, 2020. These amounts primarily related to severance and other employee related costs resulting from headcount reductions, facility realignment costs and impairments of certain ROU assets. We may incur additional restructuring expenses in the future as we continue to analyze our organizational structure.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 amounted to $1,787,152 and $2,083,365, respectively.
The decrease in depreciation and amortization of $296,213 (14%) for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year is due to certain fixed assets and intangible assets becoming fully depreciated or amortized and a decrease in the acceleration of amortization expense related to certain customer relationship intangible assets, partially offset by an increase in depreciation as a result of asset additions.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $4,427,251 and $4,414,814 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as net income (loss) excluding income taxes, non-operating income or expenses, loss on extinguishment of debt and write-off of deferred financing costs, gain (loss) on interest rate swap contracts, gain (loss) on derivative contracts, gain (loss) on investments and sale of affiliate interests, interest expense, interest income, depreciation and amortization (including impairments), share-based compensation expense or benefit, restructuring expense or credits and transaction expenses. See reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA above.
The increase in adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year was due to the increase in revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses for 2021 (excluding depreciation and amortization, restructuring and other expense and share-based compensation), as discussed above.
Operating Free Cash Flow
Operating free cash flow was $3,195,536 and $3,340,859 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in operating free cash flow for 2021 as compared to 2020 is due to an increase in cash capital expenditures, partially offset by an increase in adjusted EBITDA.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow was $1,622,363 and $1,906,209 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in free cash flow in 2021 as compared to 2020 is primarily due to an increase in cash capital expenditures and a decrease in cash from operating activities.
Interest expense, net
Interest expense, net was $1,266,591 and $1,350,341 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease of $83,750 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was attributable to the following:
Gain (Loss) on Investments and Sale of Affiliate Interests, net
Gain (loss) on investments, net for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 of $(88,898) and $320,061 consists primarily of the increase (decrease) in the fair value of the Comcast common stock owned by the Company. The effects of these gains (losses) are partially offset by the losses and gains on the related equity derivative contracts, net described below.
Gain (Loss) on Derivative Contracts, net
Gain (loss) on derivative contracts, net amounted to $85,911 and $(178,264) for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and includes realized and unrealized gains or losses due to the change in fair value of equity derivative contracts relating to the Comcast common stock owned by the Company. The effects of these gains (losses) are offset by losses (gains) on investment securities pledged as collateral, which are included in gain (loss) on investments and sale of affiliate interest, net discussed above.
Gain (Loss) on Interest Rate Swap Contracts
Gain (loss) on interest rate swap contracts amounted to $92,735 and $(78,606) for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts represent the change in the fair value of interest rate swap contracts. These swap contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt and Write-off of Deferred Financing Costs
Loss on extinguishment of debt and write-off of deferred financing costs amounted to $51,712 and $250,489 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The following table provides a summary of the loss on extinguishment of debt and the write-off of deferred financing costs recorded by the Company upon the redemption of senior guaranteed notes and senior notes:
Other Income, Net
Other income, net amounted to $9,835 and $5,577 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts include the non-service benefit (cost) components of the Company's pension plans of $3,860 and $(1,012), for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and dividends received on Comcast common stock owned by the Company.
Income Tax Expense
The Company recorded income tax expense of $294,975 for the year ended December 31, 2021, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23% which is higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%. The primary difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate is due to nondeductible officer’s and share-based compensation expense, state income taxes, net of the federal benefit, a revaluation of state deferred taxes primarily due to certain changes to the state tax rates used to measure the Company’s deferred tax liabilities, a tax benefit associated with internal restructuring and opportunity zone related investments, and certain other non-deductible expenses.
The Company recorded income tax expense of $139,748 for the year ended December 31, 2020, resulting in an effective tax rate of 24% which is higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%. The primary difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate is due to nondeductible officer’s and share-based compensation expense, state income taxes, net of the federal benefit, a revaluation of state deferred taxes primarily due to certain changes to the state tax rates used to measure the Company’s deferred tax liabilities, a tax benefit associated with claiming additional current year and prior year research and development tax credits, and certain other non-deductible expenses. Due to the taxable gain resulting from the Lightpath Transaction discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized the benefit of fully utilizing its federal net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs"), capital loss carryover, research and development tax credits, and general business credits in 2020.
CSC HOLDINGS, LLC
The consolidated statements of operations of CSC Holdings are essentially identical to the consolidated statements of operations of Altice USA, except for the following:
Refer to Altice USA's Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations herein.
The following is a reconciliation of CSC Holdings' net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Free Cash Flow:
The following is a reconciliation of net cash flow from operating activities to Free Cash Flow:
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Altice USA has no operations independent of its subsidiaries. Funding for our subsidiaries has generally been provided by cash flow from their respective operations, cash on hand and borrowings under the CSC Holdings revolving credit facility and the proceeds from the issuance of securities and borrowings under syndicated term loans in the capital markets. Our decision as to the use of cash generated from operating activities, cash on hand, borrowings under the revolving credit facility or accessing the capital markets has been based upon an ongoing review of the funding needs of the business, the optimal allocation of cash resources, the timing of cash flow generation and the cost of borrowing under the revolving credit facility, debt securities and syndicated term loans. We
target a year-end leverage ratio of 4.5x to 5.0x for CSC Holdings over time. We calculate our CSC Holdings net leverage ratio as net debt to L2QA EBITDA (Adjusted EBITDA for the two most recent consecutive fiscal quarters multiplied by 2.0).
We expect to utilize free cash flow and availability under the CSC Holdings revolving credit facility, as well as future refinancing transactions, to further extend the maturities of, or reduce the principal on, our debt obligations. The timing and terms of any refinancing transactions will be subject to, among other factors, market conditions. Additionally, we may, from time to time, depending on market conditions and other factors, use cash on hand and the proceeds from other borrowings to repay the outstanding debt securities through open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases, tender offers, or redemptions.
We believe existing cash balances, operating cash flows and availability under the CSC Holdings revolving credit facility will provide adequate funds to support our current operating plan, make planned capital expenditures and fulfill our debt service requirements for the next twelve months. However, our ability to fund our operations, make planned capital expenditures, make scheduled payments on our indebtedness and repay our indebtedness depends on our future operating performance and cash flows and our ability to access the capital markets, which, in turn, are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Competition, market disruptions or a deterioration in economic conditions could lead to lower demand for our products, as well as lower levels of advertising, and increased incidence of customers' inability to pay for the services we provide. These events would adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Although we currently believe amounts available under the CSC Holdings revolving credit facility will be available when, and if, needed, we can provide no assurance that access to such funds will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets or other conditions. The obligations of the financial institutions under the revolving credit facility are several and not joint and, as a result, a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others.
In the longer term, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund anticipated capital expenditures, meet all existing future contractual payment obligations and repay our debt at maturity. As a result, we could be dependent upon our continued access to the capital and credit markets to issue additional debt or equity or refinance existing debt obligations. We intend to raise significant amounts of funding over the next several years to fund capital expenditures, repay existing obligations and meet other obligations, and the failure to do so successfully could adversely affect our business. If we are unable to do so, we will need to take other actions including deferring capital expenditures, selling assets, seeking strategic investments from third parties or reducing or eliminating stock repurchases and discretionary uses of cash.
Debt Outstanding
The following table summarizes the carrying value of our outstanding debt, net of unamortized deferred financing costs, discounts and premiums (excluding accrued interest) as of December 31, 2021, as well as interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021.

(a)Includes $1,810,264 related to the Company's collateralized indebtedness and related interest. This indebtedness is collateralized by shares of Comcast common stock.

The net proceeds from the sale of these notes were used to early redeem the $1,498,806 aggregate principal amount of CSC Holdings' 5.500% senior guaranteed notes due May 15, 2026, plus pay accrued interest and the associated premium related to the early redemption of these notes. The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of borrowings under the CSC Holdings revolving credit facility and share repurchases. In connection with the early redemptions, the Company recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt aggregating $51,712, reflecting the early redemption premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs on these notes.
