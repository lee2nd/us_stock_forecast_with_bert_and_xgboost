ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
(in thousands, except per share amounts)
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
Ampco-Pittsburgh Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Corporation”) manufacture and sell highly engineered, high-performance specialty metal products and customized equipment utilized by industry throughout the world. It operates in two business segments - the Forged and Cast Engineered Products (“FCEP”) segment and the Air and Liquid Processing (“ALP”) segment. This segment presentation is consistent with how the Corporation’s chief operating decision maker evaluates financial performance and makes resource allocation and strategic decisions about the business.
COVID-19
On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced a global health emergency caused by a new strain of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and advised of the risks to the international community as the virus spread globally. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. In response, many state and local governments required the closure of various businesses. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, however, issued guidance outlining criteria to identify domestic businesses as operating in critical infrastructure industries, essential to the economic prosperity, security and continuity of the United States, which provides exceptions to certain closures mandated by state and local governments and permits businesses to continue operations during such an order. The Corporation’s domestic businesses were, and continue to be, deemed to participate in critical infrastructure industries; however, despite the designation and particularly in 2020, the Corporation has had to periodically and temporarily idle certain operations of its FCEP segment and, consequently, furlough certain of its employees in response to market conditions. While most of these direct impacts were experienced in 2020, as variants have developed, the Corporation has experienced episodic disruptions to its operations or the operations of its customers and suppliers. The pandemic also has spurred disruptions to the global supply chain, which is believed to be a key factor in the global inflationary pressures of 2021. Accordingly, the Corporation has experienced, and may continue to experience, customer-requested delays of deliveries or cancellation of orders, lower order intake resulting from customers postponing projects, inability to obtain raw materials and supplies critical to the manufacturing process, delays in receiving and shipping product due to the lack of transportation, and higher cost of production and transportation.
It is difficult to isolate the impact of the pandemic on the Corporation’s operating results, particularly in relation to the unabsorbed costs resulting from the periodic and temporary idling of certain of the Corporation’s forged and cast roll operations and furloughing of employees. In addition, the Corporation is uncertain of the full effect the pandemic will have on it for the longer term since the scope and duration of the pandemic is unknown, and evolving factors such as the level and timing of the distribution of efficacious vaccines across the world, hesitancy to use the vaccine and the extent of any resurgences of the virus or emergence of new variants of the virus will impact the stability of economic recovery and growth. The extent to which the operations of the Corporation, and the operations of its customers and vendors, may be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend largely on these future developments. The Corporation may experience long-term disruptions to its operations resulting from changes in government policy or guidance; quarantines of employees, customers and suppliers in areas affected by the pandemic; and closures of businesses or manufacturing facilities critical to its business or supply chains. It also may incur higher write-offs of accounts receivables and impairment charges on its asset values, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. The Corporation is actively monitoring, and will continue to actively monitor, the pandemic and the potential impact on its operations, financial condition, liquidity, suppliers, industry, and workforce.
In response to the pandemic, the United States federal government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferral of employer-side social security payments and contributions to employee benefit plans, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations, and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. Subsequently, on March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan (“ARP”) Act of 2021 was enacted into law, providing the next phase of economic relief as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ARP Act, among other things, extends the provision relating to refundable payroll tax credits and deferral of contributions to employee benefit plans. Similar programs have been offered in certain of the foreign jurisdictions in which the Corporation operates, including subsidies and reimbursement of certain employee-related costs. While the Corporation has taken, and intends to continue to take, advantage of various provisions of the CARES Act, the ARP Act and other similar programs offered domestically and in the foreign jurisdictions in which the Corporation operates, where possible, it is unable to determine what impact those provisions may have on its consolidated financial statements in the future.
The Segments
The FCEP segment produces forged hardened steel rolls, cast rolls and forged engineered products (“FEP”). Forged hardened steel rolls are used primarily in cold rolling mills by producers of steel, aluminum and other metals. Cast rolls, which are produced in a variety of iron and steel qualities, are used mainly in hot and cold strip mills, medium/heavy section mills and plate mills. FEP principally are sold to customers in the steel distribution market, oil and gas industry and the aluminum and plastic extrusion industries. The segment has operations in the United States, England, Sweden, Slovenia, and an equity interest in three joint venture companies in China. Collectively, the segment primarily competes with European, Asian and North and South American companies in both domestic and foreign markets and distributes a significant portion of its products through sales offices located throughout the world.
For the FCEP segment, roll market conditions have recovered to near pre-pandemic levels, and expectations are for sales orders to continue to improve in 2022. The FEP market also continues to strengthen with increasing demand from the steel distribution and oil and gas markets. During 2021, however, the segment experienced escalating costs, particularly for raw materials, energy and transportation, and supply chain issues. In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Corporation announced price increases for its forged and cast rolls and FEP and changes to its surcharge policy, each aimed at recovering a portion of these escalating costs. For forged and cast rolls, the price increase was effective immediately following the announcement. For FEP, the increase was effective immediately on all new orders received as of the date of the announcement, or as relevant contract terms permit. The primary focus for this segment is to maintain a strong position in the roll market and to continue diversification and development of FEP for use in other industries, operational and efficiency improvements at its facilities, and capital equipment investment activities to upgrade existing equipment with a goal of reducing costs, improving reliability and increasing FEP capacity and capabilities.
The ALP segment includes Aerofin, Buffalo Air Handling and Buffalo Pumps, all divisions of Air & Liquid Systems Corporation (“Air & Liquid”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation. Aerofin produces custom-engineered finned tube heat exchange coils and related heat transfer products for a variety of industries including OEM/commercial, nuclear power generation and industrial manufacturing. Buffalo Air Handling produces large custom-designed air handling systems for institutional (e.g., hospital, university), pharmaceutical and general industrial building markets. Buffalo Pumps manufactures centrifugal pumps for the fossil-fueled power generation, marine defense and industrial refrigeration industries. The segment has operations in Virginia and New York with headquarters in Carnegie, Pennsylvania. The segment distributes a significant portion of its products through a common independent group of sales offices located throughout the United States and Canada.
The ALP businesses are benefitting from steady demand but, similarly, are facing increasing production and transportation costs and supply chain issues. The segment has been implementing price increases for certain of its products to help mitigate these inflationary effects. The focus for this segment is to grow revenues, increase margins, strengthen engineering and manufacturing capabilities, increase manufacturing productivity, and continue to improve its sales distribution network.
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW
The Corporation
(1)
(Loss) income from operations for the Air and Liquid Processing segment includes charges for asbestos-related costs of $6,661 and $283 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, as more fully explained in Note 19, Litigation, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Net sales equaled $344,920 and $328,544 for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase of $16,376 is principally attributable to a higher volume of shipments of FEP for the FCEP segment, primarily due to increasing demand from the steel distribution and oil and gas markets, which increased net sales by approximately $17,100. A discussion of sales by segment is included below.
Backlog equaled $292,554 at December 31, 2021, versus $246,131 as of December 31, 2020. Backlog represents the accumulation of firm orders on hand which: (i) are supported by evidence of a contractual arrangement, (ii) include a fixed and determinable sales price, (iii) have collectability that is reasonably assured, and (iv) generally are expected to ship within two years from the backlog reporting date. Backlog at a certain date may not be a direct measure of future revenue for a particular order because price increases, negotiated subsequently to the original order, are not included in backlog until the updated contract is received from the customer and certain surcharges are not determinable until the order is completed and ready for shipment to the customer. Approximately 6% of the backlog is expected to be released after 2022. A discussion of backlog by segment is included below.
Gross margin, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of net sales was 16.6% and 21.6% for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease from the prior year is primarily attributable to the FCEP segment which experienced higher net raw material and energy costs, higher repairs and maintenance spend associated with extended machine outages, and changes in product mix. Additionally, the prior year benefited from receipt of business interruption insurance proceeds of $769 for equipment outages that occurred in 2018 (the “Proceeds from Business Interruption Insurance Claim”). For the ALP segment, gross margin, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly as a result of higher costs and changes in product mix, the majority of which was offset by higher sales prices.
Selling and administrative expenses were comparable, totaling $45,998 (13.3% of net sales) and $45,542 (13.9% of net sales) for 2021 and 2020, respectively. In summary:
•
Severance costs associated with early-retirement incentives for two executive officers, employee terminations at one of the Corporation’s cast roll facilities and costs associated with the closing of a foreign sales office increased expense in 2021 by $1,600 (the “Reorganization-Related Costs”);
•
Commission expense resulting primarily from higher FEP sales increased expense in 2021 by $1,300; and
•
Higher exchange rates used to translate the selling and administrative costs of the Corporation’s foreign subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar increased expense in 2021 by $900; offset by
•
Lower incentive compensation, which reduced expense in 2021 by $2,300;
•
Lower spend on research and development activities, which reduced expense in 2021 by $800; and
•
Lower bad debt expense in 2021, as a result of bad debt reserves established in 2020 for FCEP customers adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced expense by $500.
Depreciation and amortization expense was comparable, equaling $17,877 and $18,575 for 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Charge for asbestos-related costs equaled $6,661 and $283 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, (the “Asbestos-Related Charge”). The charge in 2021 represents changes in the estimated costs of pending and future asbestos claims, net of additional insurance recoveries, through 2052, the estimated final date by which the Corporation expects to have settled all asbestos-related claims. The amount in 2020 represents a charge for the potential insolvency of an asbestos-related insurance carrier. See Note 19, Litigation, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further explanation.
Investment-related income equaled $1,084 and $1,396 for 2021 and 2020, respectively, and represents primarily dividends received from one of the Corporation’s Chinese joint ventures.
Interest expense equaled $3,599 and $4,114 for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease principally is due to lower average borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility in 2021 compared to 2020.
Other income - net is comprised of the following:
Other income - net fluctuated due to:
•
Higher pension and other postretirement income due to lower interest costs on employee benefit obligations as a result of lower discount rates coupled with a higher expected return on plan assets as a result of an increase in the fair value of plan assets year over year;
•
Changes in the market value of the investments in the Rabbi trust; and
•
Higher foreign exchange losses.
Income tax (provision) benefit equaled $(2,305) and 470 for 2021 and 2020, respectively, and includes income taxes associated with the Corporation’s profitable operations. An income tax benefit is not able to be recognized on losses of certain of the Corporation’s entities since it is “more likely than not” the asset will not be realized. Accordingly, changes in the income tax (provision) benefit for each period includes the effects of changes in the pre-tax income of the Corporation’s profitable operations. In addition, the income tax benefit for 2020 includes a $3,502 benefit made possible by the CARES Act, which enabled the Corporation to carry back net operating losses to an earlier period, at a higher tax rate, and to release a portion of the valuation allowance it had previously established against its deferred income tax assets.
Net loss attributable to Ampco-Pittsburgh and net loss per common share for 2021 include the Asbestos-Related Charge and the Reorganization-Related Costs which increased the net loss of Ampco-Pittsburgh by $8,157 or $0.43 per common share. Net income attributable to Ampco-Pittsburgh and net income per common share for 2020 include an income tax benefit of $3,502, due to the enactment of the CARES Act, the Proceeds from Business Interruption Insurance Claim and the Asbestos-Related Charge, which had a combined net positive impact on the net income of Ampco-Pittsburgh of $3,988 or $0.28 per common share.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Corporation presents non-GAAP adjusted (loss) income from operations, which is calculated as (loss) income from operations excluding the Asbestos-Related Charge, the Reorganization-Related Costs and the Proceeds from Business Interruption Insurance Claim for each of the years, as applicable. This non-GAAP financial measure is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies.
The Corporation has presented non-GAAP adjusted (loss) income from operations because it is a key measure used by the Corporation’s management and Board of Directors to understand and evaluate the Corporation’s operating performance and to develop operational goals for managing its business. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes significant charges or credits, that are one-time charges or credits, unrelated to the Corporation’s ongoing results of operations or beyond its control. Additionally, a portion of the incentive and compensation arrangements for certain employees is based on the Corporation’s business performance. The Corporation believes this non-GAAP financial measure helps identify underlying trends in its business that otherwise could be masked by the effect of the items that it excludes from adjusted (loss) income from operations. In particular, the Corporation believes that the exclusion of the Asbestos-Related Charge, the Reorganization-Related Costs and the Proceeds from Business Interruption
Insurance Claim can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of the Corporation’s core business performance. The Corporation also believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to management, shareholders and investors, and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allowing for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by the Corporation’s management in its financial and operational decision-making.
Adjusted (loss) income from operations is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations related to the use of adjusted (loss) income from operations rather than (loss) income from operations, which is the nearest GAAP equivalent. Among other things, there can be no assurance that additional expenses similar to the Asbestos-Related Charge and the Reorganization-Related Costs or additional benefits similar to the Proceeds from Business Interruption Insurance Claim will not occur in future periods.
The adjustments reflected in adjusted (loss) income from operations are pre-tax. The tax impact associated with these adjustments was $132 for 2021 and not significant for 2020.
The following is a reconciliation of (loss) income from operations to non-GAAP adjusted (loss) income from operations for 2021 and 2020, respectively:
(1)
For 2021, represents a charge for changes in the estimated costs of pending and future asbestos claims, net of additional insurance recoveries, through 2052, the estimated final date by which the Corporation expects to have settled all asbestos-related claims. For 2020, represents a charge for the potential insolvency of an asbestos-related insurance carrier. See Note 19, Litigation, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further explanation.
(2)
Represents severance costs associated with early-retirement incentives for two executive officers, employee terminations at one of the Corporation’s cast roll facilities and costs associated with the closing of a foreign sales office.
(3)
Represents business interruption insurance proceeds received for equipment outages that occurred in 2018.
Forged and Cast Engineered Products
Net sales increased by $22,315 in 2021 from 2020 principally due to the net of:
•
Higher volume of FEP shipments as a result of increased demand from the steel distribution and oil and gas markets, which increased net sales in 2021 when compared to 2020 by approximately $17,100;
•
Net higher variable-index surcharges and pricing passed through to customers as a result of higher raw material costs, which increased net sales in 2021 when compared to 2020 by approximately $5,800;
•
Higher volume of mill roll shipments resulting from improved demand as certain customers returned to pre-pandemic levels of production and, as a result, began to replenish roll inventory, which increased net sales in 2021 when compared to 2020 by approximately $400;
•
Changes in exchange rates used to translate net sales of the segment’s foreign subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar, which increased net sales in 2021 when compared to 2020 by approximately $9,400; offset by
•
Changes in product mix, which decreased net sales in 2021 when compared to 2020 by approximately $10,400.
Operating results decreased by $11,686 in 2021 when compared to 2020 primarily as a result of:
•
Higher costs of raw materials, energy and other production costs, net of variable-index surcharges passed through to customers, which reduced operating results in 2021 when compared to 2020 by approximately $15,100;
•
Changes in sales product mix net of higher sales volumes, which reduced operating results in 2021 when compared to 2020 by approximately $3,100;
•
Higher maintenance spending associated with extended machine outages, which reduced operating results in 2021 when compared to 2020 by approximately $3,000;
•
Higher commissions principally associated with the higher volume of FEP sales, which reduced operating results in 2021 when compared to 2020 by approximately $1,300; offset by
•
Higher production levels when compared to the pandemic-plagued levels of the prior year resulting in a better absorption of costs, which improved operating results in 2021 when compared to 2020 by approximately $8,900; and
•
Changes in exchange rates used to translate operating results of the segment’s foreign subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar, which increased operating results in 2021 when compared to 2020 by approximately $800.
In addition, operating results for 2020 included:
•
Proceeds received from the Business Interruption Insurance Claim of $769; offset by
•
Charges for anticipated bad debts and slow-moving inventory reserves of approximately $1,000 for customers expected to be more severely impacted by the pandemic.
Backlog equaled $223,321 at December 31, 2021, compared to $191,919 at December 31, 2020, with the improvement in current year-end backlog of $31,402 principally due to:
•
Increased demand from the steel distribution and oil and gas markets coupled with favorable product mix, surcharge and pricing, which increased FEP backlog by $19,700; and
•
Favorable product mix, surcharge and pricing for mill rolls, which improved roll backlog by $12,900; offset by
•
Lower foreign exchange rates used to translate the backlog of the Corporation’s foreign subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar, which reduced backlog by approximately $1,200 at December 31, 2021, compared to December 31, 2020.
At December 31, 2021, approximately 5% of the backlog is expected to ship after 2022.
Air and Liquid Processing
(1)
Operating income for 2021 includes a charge of $6,661 for changes in the estimated costs of pending and future asbestos claims, net of additional insurance recoveries, through 2052, the estimated final date by which the Corporation expects to have settled all asbestos-related claims. Operating income for 2020, includes a charge of $283 for the potential insolvency of an asbestos-related insurance carrier. See Note 19, Litigation, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further explanation.
Net sales for 2021 decreased from the prior year by $5,939. Sales of centrifugal pumps declined from a year ago as a result of a lower volume of commercial pump shipments partially offset by a higher volume of shipments to U.S. Navy shipbuilders. Sales of air handling units for the current year decreased from the prior year primarily as a result of customer-requested deferrals and delays in receiving required components. Sales of heat exchange coils were slightly less in 2021 when compared to 2020 with lower sales to the nuclear industry being offset by higher sales to the commercial market.
Operating income for 2021 includes the Asbestos-Related Charge of $6,661 for changes in the estimated costs of pending and future asbestos claims, net of additional insurance recoveries, through 2052, the estimated final date by which the Corporation expects to have settled all asbestos-related claims. Operating income for 2020 includes the Asbestos-Related Charge of $283 for the potential insolvency of an asbestos-related insurance carrier. See Note 19, Litigation, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further explanation. In addition, operating income for the current year was negatively impacted by the lower volume of shipments but benefited from changes in product mix and savings generated from process improvements.
Backlog at December 31, 2021, improved $15,021 from December 31, 2020, principally due to additional order intake for centrifugal pumps and higher on-hand orders for air handlers due, in part, to the aforementioned deferrals by customers and delays in receiving required components. At December 31, 2021, approximately 9% of the backlog is expected to ship after 2022.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Net cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities equaled $(15,866) and $33,635 for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The significant change between the years primarily is due to (i) a net loss incurred in 2021 versus net income in 2020 and (ii) a higher investment in trade working capital year over year as the Corporation began to return to a higher level of business activity following the pandemic-plagued levels of the prior year and, for inventories, higher costs associated with inflation and supply chain disruptions. Although the Corporation recorded the Asbestos-Related Charge in 2021 and 2020, these were non-cash charges and, accordingly, did not impact net cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities. Instead, net asbestos-related payments equaled $9,903 and $8,725 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are expected to approximate $7,000 in 2022.
Deferred employer-side social security payments equaled $2,163 through December 31, 2020, of which one half was paid in 2021, and, under the current provisions of the CARES Act, the balance will be paid in December 2022. Contributions to the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits plans equaled $1,658 and $7,857 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are expected to approximate $3,100 in 2022. Contributions for 2021 and expected contributions for 2022 are lower than contributions for 2020 due to relief provided by the ARP Act.
Net cash flows used in investing activities primarily represented expenditures for the FCEP segment. The Corporation has undertaken a significant capital program approximating $27,000 to upgrade existing equipment at certain of its FCEP locations, which is anticipated to occur over the next two years. At December 31, 2021, commitments for future capital expenditures, including those associated with the FCEP capital program, approximated $20,800.
Net cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities fluctuated year over year primarily due to:
•
Net borrowings from the Corporation’s revolving credit facility of $23,744 in 2021 versus repayment of (i) net amounts outstanding under the Corporation’s revolving credit facility of $28,273 and (ii) an outstanding Industrial Revenue Bond at maturity of $4,120 in 2020; and
•
Proceeds from shareholders exercising warrants for the Corporation’s common stock of $3,308 in 2021 versus net common equity proceeds of $18,139 received in 2020 when the Corporation completed an equity rights offering. See Note 12, Equity Rights Offering, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further explanation.
The effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents is primarily attributable to the fluctuation of the British pound and Swedish krona against the U.S. dollar.
As a result of the above, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $6,505 during 2021 and ended the period at $10,337 in comparison to $16,842 at December 31, 2020. The majority of the Corporation’s cash and cash equivalents is held by its foreign operations. Domestic customer remittances are used to pay down borrowings under the Corporation’s revolving credit facility daily, resulting in minimal cash maintained by the Corporation’s domestic operations. Cash held by the Corporation’s foreign operations is considered to be permanently re-invested; accordingly, a provision for estimated local and withholding tax has not been made. If the Corporation were to remit any foreign earnings to it or any of its U.S. entities, the estimated tax impact would be insignificant.
Funds on hand, funds generated from future operations and availability under the Corporation’s revolving credit facility are expected to be sufficient to finance the Corporation’s operational requirements. The maturity date for the revolving credit facility is June 29, 2026, and, subject to the other terms and conditions of the revolving credit agreement, will become due on that date. While availability under the revolving credit facility also should be sufficient to fund the capital equipment investment activities for the FCEP segment, the Corporation currently is exploring supplemental financing. As of December 31, 2021, remaining availability under the revolving credit facility approximated $34,000, net of standard availability reserves.
With respect to litigation, see Note 19, Litigation, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. With respect to environmental matters, see Note 21, Environmental Matters, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
The Corporation’s off-balance sheet arrangements include the previously mentioned expected future capital expenditures and letters of credit unrelated to the Industrial Revenue Bonds. See Note 11, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These arrangements are not considered significant to the liquidity, capital resources, market risk, or credit risk of the Corporation.
EFFECTS OF INFLATION
Inflationary and market pressures on costs are likely to continue to be experienced. Product pricing is reflective of current costs. For the FCEP segment, approximately 50% to 70% of customer orders include a commodity surcharge; the ability to pass on future increases in the price of commodities for the balance of the customer orders will be negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. To minimize the effect of future increases, the Corporation has entered into pricing for a portion of the electricity and natural gas for certain of its FCEP operating entities and has long-term labor agreements at each of the key locations. Certain of these agreements will expire in 2022. As is consistent with past practice, the Corporation will negotiate with the intent to secure mutually beneficial arrangements covering multiple years. See Note 11, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, and Note 14, Derivative Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Corporation has identified critical accounting policies that are important to the presentation of its financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations and involve the most complex or subjective assessments. Critical accounting policies relate to assessing recoverability of property, plant and equipment and accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits, litigation and loss contingencies, and income taxes.
Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the long-lived assets may not be recoverable. If the undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the assets are less than their carrying value, then the asset value may not be fully recoverable, potentially resulting in a write-down of the asset value. Estimates of future cash flows are based on expected market conditions over the remaining useful life of the primary asset(s). Accordingly, assumptions are made about pricing, volume and asset-resale values. The Corporation believes the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for property, plant and equipment are recoverable and are not impaired as of December 31, 2021.
Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works. To accomplish this, input from the Corporation’s actuaries is evaluated and extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation, long-term rate of return on plan assets, longevity, employee turnover and discount rates. The curtailment of the majority of the Corporation’s defined benefit pension plans and the amendment of various other postretirement benefit plans has helped to mitigate the volatility in net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs resulting from changes in these assumptions.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is an estimate of the average rates of earnings expected to be earned on funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. Since these benefits will be paid over many years, the expected long-term rate of return is reflective of current investment returns and investment returns over a longer period. Also, consideration is given to target and actual asset allocations, inflation and real risk-free return. The Corporation believes the expected long-term rate of return ranging between 6.50% and 7.00% for its domestic plans and 2.90% for its foreign plans to be reasonable. Actual returns on plan assets for 2021 approximated 8.70% for the domestic plans and 10.76% for the foreign plans. A percentage point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return would increase annual pension expense by approximately $2,500. Conversely, a percentage point increase in the expected long-term rate of return would decrease annual pension expense by approximately $2,500.
The discount rates used in determining future pension obligations and other postretirement benefits for each of the plans are based on rates of return for high-quality fixed-income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity
of the pension and other postretirement benefits. High-quality fixed-income investments are defined as those investments which have received one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency with maturities of 10+ years. Assumed discount rates range between 2.79% and 2.91% for its domestic plans, 2.91% for its other postretirement benefits plans, and 1.95% for its foreign plans at December 31, 2021. A 1/4 percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease projected and accumulated benefit obligations by approximately $10,300. Conversely, a 1/4 percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase projected and accumulated benefit obligations by approximately $10,300.
The Corporation believes that the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are based on assumptions that are appropriate at December 31, 2021, although actual outcomes could differ.
Litigation and loss contingency accruals are made when it is determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Specifically, the Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to its businesses. In addition, claims have been asserted alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos-containing components historically used in some products manufactured by predecessors of Air & Liquid (the “Asbestos Liability”). To assist the Corporation in determining whether an estimate could be made of the potential liability for pending and unasserted future claims for the Asbestos Liability along with applicable insurance coverage, and the amounts of any estimates, the Corporation hires a nationally recognized asbestos-liability expert and an insurance consultant. Based on their analyses, reserves for probable and reasonably estimable costs for the Asbestos Liability, including defense costs, and receivables for the insurance recoveries that are deemed probable are established. These amounts rely on assumptions which are based on currently known facts and strategy.
In 2018, the Corporation undertook a review of the Asbestos Liability claims, defense costs and the likelihood for insurance recoveries. The Corporation extended its estimate of the Asbestos Liability, including the estimated costs of settlement and defense costs relating to pending claims and future claims projected to be filed against it through 2052, the estimated final date by which the Corporation expects to have settled all asbestos-related claims. The Corporation’s policy is to evaluate the Asbestos Liability and related insurance receivables as well as the underlying assumptions on a regular basis. In 2021, the Corporation reviewed the assumptions and determined certain adjustments to the Asbestos Liability and related insurance coverage were necessary based on current experience and future expectations. As a result, the Corporation recorded an additional charge of $6,661 representing the change in the estimated costs of pending and future asbestos claims, net of additional insurance recoveries, through 2052. Key variables in these assumptions, including the ability to reasonably estimate the Asbestos Liability through the expected final date by which the Corporation expects to have settled all asbestos-related claims, are summarized in Note 19, Litigation, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Key assumptions include the number and nature of new claims to be filed each year, the average cost of disposing of each new claim, average annual defense costs, and the solvency risk with respect to the relevant insurance carriers. Other factors that may affect the Asbestos Liability and the Corporation’s ability to recover under its insurance policies include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, reforms that may be made by state and federal courts, the passage of state or federal tort reform legislation, and continued solvency of the insurance carriers. Actual expenses or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in the calculations vary significantly from actual results.
The Corporation intends to continue to evaluate the Asbestos Liability and related insurance receivables as well as the underlying assumptions on a regular basis to determine whether further adjustments to the estimates are required. Due to the uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation and insurance, these regular reviews may result in the incurrence of future charges or credits; however, the Corporation is currently unable to estimate such future changes. Adjustments, if any, to the Corporation’s estimate of the Asbestos Liability and/or insurance receivables could be material to its operating results for the periods in which the adjustments to the liability or receivable are recorded, and to its liquidity and financial position when such liabilities are paid.
Accounting for income taxes includes the Corporation evaluation of the underlying accounts, permanent and temporary differences, its tax filing positions and interpretations of existing tax law. A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred income tax assets to reduce them to the amount that is “more likely than not” to be realized. In doing so, assumptions are made about the future profitability of the Corporation and the nature of that profitability. Actual results may differ from these assumptions. If the Corporation determined it would not be able to realize all or part of the deferred income tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be established resulting in a charge to net income (loss). Likewise, if the Corporation determined it would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in excess of the net amount recorded, a portion of the existing valuation allowance would be released resulting in a credit to net income (loss). As of December 31, 2021, the valuation allowance approximates $42,441, reducing deferred income tax assets, net of deferred income tax liabilities, to $2,176, an amount the Corporation believes is “more likely than not” to be realized.
The Corporation does not recognize a tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements related to a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return unless it is “more likely than not” that the tax authorities will sustain the tax position solely on the basis of the position’s technical merits. Consideration primarily is given to legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings and case law as well as their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position when assessing the sustainability of the tax position.
In the event a tax position no longer meets the “more likely than not” criteria, the Corporation would reverse the tax benefit by recognizing a liability and recording a charge to earnings. Conversely, if the Corporation subsequently determined that a tax position met the “more likely than not” criteria, it would recognize the tax benefit by reducing the liability and recording a credit to earnings. As of December 31, 2021, based on information known to date, the Corporation believes the amount of unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, which may be challenged by the tax authorities, not to be significant.
