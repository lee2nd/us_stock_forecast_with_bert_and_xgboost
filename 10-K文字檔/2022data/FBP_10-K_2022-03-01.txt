SIGNIFICANT EVENTS
Stock Repurchase Program
On April
26, 2021,
the Corporation
announced that
its Board
of Directors
approved a
stock repurchase
program, under
which the
Corporation
may repurchase
up to
$300 million
of its
outstanding stock,
including common
and preferred
stock, commencing
in the
second
quarter of
2021 through
June 30,
2022. During
the year
ended December
31, 2021,
the Corporation
repurchased 16,740,467
shares of
its common
stock for
$213.9 million.
In addition,
on November
30, 2021,
the Corporation
redeemed all
of its
outstanding
shares of
non-convertible, non-cumulative
perpetual monthly
income, Series
A through
E Preferred
Stock for
its liquidation

of 2022
the Corporation
repurchased 3,409,697
million shares
of common
stock
for the remaining $50 million authorized under the stock repurchase
program.
COVID-19 Pandemic and Economy
The
ongoing
COVID-19
pandemic
has
caused
unprecedented
and
continuing
uncertainty,
volatility
and
disruption
in
financial
markets
and
in
governmental,
commercial
and
consumer
activity
in
worldwide,
including
in
the
markets
in
which
the
Corporation
operates. In
response, federal,
state, and
local governments
have taken
and continue
to take
actions designed
to mitigate
the effect
of
the virus on
public health and
to address the
economic impact of
the virus. As
restrictive measures were
eased during the
end of 2020
and into 2021, based
upon positive signs of
recovery driven by
vaccination and government
stimulus programs, economic
activity has
improved.
As
of
February
18,
2022,
approximately
6.6
million
vaccines
of
COVID-19
have
been
administered.
Approximately
2.9
million
people
have received
at least
one
dose of
the COVID-19
vaccine and
approximately 2.6
million
people,
or approximately
84.9% of
Puerto Rico’s eligible population,
have completed the vaccination process and 54.3% have received the booster
shot.
The
Corporation
continues
to
operate
consistent
with
guidance
from
federal
and
local
authorities.
The
Corporation’s
banking
branches
are
operating
during
regular
hours
following
health
and
safety
requirements
to
comply
with
federal
and
local
health
mandates, including, among other things, deep cleaning, face mask requirements
,
and strict social distancing measures. On February 8,
2022,
the
Corporation
announced
that
as
part
of
COVID-19
protocols,
all
employees,
service
providers
and
consultants
of
the
Corporation
must
have
the
booster
shot
of
the
COVID-19
vaccine
by
March
1,
2022,
with
few
exceptions.
Additional
vaccine
mandates
have
been announced
in jurisdictions
in which
our businesses
operate.
Adoption
of electronic
channels continues
to grow
significantly during
the ongoing
pandemic,
with active
digital banking
users growing
by 16%
during 2021
while capturing
over 40%
of deposits through digital and self-service channels.
Our
results
of
operations
for the
year
of
continue
to reflect
an
improvement
from
the
disruption
caused
by
the COVID-19
pandemic. However,
we maintain a
cautious view
of the
macroeconomic outlook
due to
continuing uncertainty
regarding the
pace of
recovery
in the
economy and
uncertainty
related to
the COVID-19
pandemic,
including the
emergence
of new
variants of
the virus,
such as
the Omicron
variant, which
appears to
be the
most transmissible
variant to
date. Uncertainties
associated with
the pandemic
include
the
duration
of
the
COVID-19
outbreak
and
any
related
infections,
including
those
from
new
variants
of
the
virus,
the
effectiveness of
COVID-19 vaccines,
vaccination rates
among the
population, the
impact on
our customers,
employees,
and vendors,
and the impact to the economy as a whole.
The
CARES
Act
or
“CARES
Act
of
2020”,
as
amended
by
the
Consolidated
Appropriations
Act,
2021,
included
an allocation
of
$659
billion
for
SBA PPP
loans.
SBA
PPP loans
are
forgivable,
in
whole
or in
part,
if the
proceeds
are
used for
payroll and
other
permitted
purposes in
accordance
with the
requirements
of the
program.
These loans
carry a
fixed
rate of
1.00% and
a term
of two
years
(loans
made
before
June
5,
2020)
or
five
years
(loans
made
on
or
after
June
5,
2020),
if
not
forgiven,
in
whole
or
in
part.
Payments are
deferred until either
the date on
which the SBA
remits the amount
of forgiveness proceeds
to the lender
or the date
that
is 10
months after
the last
day of
the covered
period if
the borrower
does not
apply for
forgiveness within
that 10-month
period. On
December
27,
2020,
President
Trump
signed
another
COVID-19
relief
bill
that
extended
and
modified
several
provisions
of
the
program.
This
included
an
additional
allocation
of
$284
billion.
The
SBA
reactivated
the
program
on
January
11,
and
the
program ended on May 31, 2021.
As
of
December
31,
2021,
the
Corporation’s
SBA
PPP
loan
portfolio
amounted
to
$145.0
million,
net
of
unearned
fees
of
$7.9
million.
As applicable,
the unearned
fees are
accreted
into income
based
on the
contractual period
of
two or
five years.
Upon
SBA
forgiveness,
unamortized
fees
are
then
recognized
into
interest
income.
During
the
years
ended
December
31,
and
2020,
the
Corporation
received
forgiveness
remittances
and
consumer
payments
related
to
approximately
$543.6
million
and
$48.9
million,
respectively,
in principal balance of
SBA PPP loans. As
of December 31,
2021, we have processed
forgiveness to approximately
80%
of our customers.
Forgiveness remittances in the year ended 2021 accelerated
the fee income recognition by $13.2 million.
Total
deposits, excluding
brokered deposits
and government
deposits, continued
to increase
and were
$14.2
billion as
of December
31,
2021,
an
increase
of
$1.4
billion
from
December
31,
2020.
In
addition,
government
deposits
increased
by
$1.2
billion
to
$3.3
billion as of December 31, 2021,
compared to $2.1 billion as of December
31, 2020. The strong growth in deposits
continues to reflect
the effect
of government
relief programs
on the
liquidity levels
of our
customers, including
increases in
the balance
of transactional
accounts
of municipalities
in Puerto
Rico and
the local
government
of the
USVI in
connection
with the
American
Rescue Plan
Act
(“ARPA”)
funding for states and local
governments. Our liquidity levels
and capital position remain strong,
with capital ratios that are
well
above
regulatory
requirements.
This
robust
liquidity
and
capital
levels
provide
us
with
significant
flexibility
to
maintain
the
strength
of
our
balance
sheet
and
return
capital
to
shareholders
through
share
repurchases
and
dividend
payments,
subject
to
regulatory considerations.
During
economic
conditions
started
to
show
significant
signs
of
recovery,
which
included
improved
consumer
demand
evidenced by rise
in retail sales, auto
and home sales
and recovery in
the payroll employment
in Puerto Rico
where it reached
98% of
the
pre-pandemic
level. The
early
signs of
economic
recovery have
impacted positively
the
Corporation
which
among
other
things,
during
2021 grew
total loan
originations
by approximately
17% when
compared
to 2020
and
is reflecting
a strong
commercial
loan
pipeline. Additionally,
on January 27,
2022, the PROMESA
oversight board certified
the 2022 Fiscal Plan
for Puerto Rico
(the “2022
Fiscal Plan”).
The 2022
Fiscal Plan reflects
the Commonwealth
Plan of Adjustment
recently confirmed
by the U.S.
District Court for
the District of
Puerto Rico. Relative to
the previous fiscal
plan, the 2022 Fiscal
Plan incorporates a
new set of expenditure
projections
that
factor
in
the
now-established
debt
service
requirements
pursuant
to
the
Plan
of
Adjustment,
as
well
as
additional
investments
enabled
by
the
increased
resources
available
to
the
government.
The
Fiscal
Plan
prioritizes
resource
allocations
across
three
major
themes:
(i)
investing
in
the
operational
capacity
of
the
government
to
deliver
services
with
Civil
Service
Reform,
(ii)
prioritizing obligations to current and future retirees, and (iii) creating
a fiscally responsible post-bankruptcy government.
Integration
of BSPR
During the
year ended
December 31, 2021,
the Corporation completed
the conversion
of all BSPR’s
core systems into
FirstBank’s
systems.
In
conjunction
with
the
conversion
of
BSPR’s
core
systems,
the
Corporation
had
consolidated
a
total
of
nine
banking
branches
and
the
Corporation
decided
late
during
the
fourth
quarter
of
to
consolidate
four
additional
branches,
which
are
expected to be completed during the first half of 2022.
In
addition,
during
the
year
ended
December
31,
2021,
the
Corporation
continued
to
execute
in
reducing
personnel
and
service
contract
expenses
and
completing
other
business
rationalization
activities.
Cumulative
merger
and
restructuring
expenses
of
$64.4
million have been incurred through December
31, 2021, of which $26.4 million
was incurred during 2021. The total amount
of merger
and
restructuring
costs
related
to
the
BSPR acquisition
was
originally
estimated
to
be
approximately
$65
million.
The
Corporation
does not expect any
additional significant merger
and restructuring expenses
during 2022. The Corporation
also has estimated that
the
combined
entities
will
achieve
total
annual
pre-tax
savings
of
approximately
$49
million,
which
are
expected
to
be
fully
realized
during 2022.
LIBOR Transition
Following
the
announcement
by
the
United
Kingdom’s
Financial
Conduct
Authority
(the
“FCA”)
that
it
would
no
longer
compel
participating
banks
to
submit
rates
for
the
London
Interbank
Offered
Rate
(LIBOR)
after
2021,
regulators
and
market
participants
in
various
jurisdictions
have
identified
recommended
replacement
rates
for
LIBOR,
and
many
have
published
recommended
conventions to
allow new
and existing
products to
incorporate
fallbacks or
that reference
these Alternative
Reference
Rates
(“ARRs”).
In
March
2021,
the
FCA
confirmed
that
publication
of
the
overnight
and
one
month,
three-month,
six-month
and
twelve-month U.S.
Dollar LIBOR settings
will cease or
become no longer
representative of the
market the rates
seek to measure
(i.e.,
non-representative) immediately after June 30, 2023, and all other
U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings, including the one week and two-month
U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings,
became non-representative
after December 31,
2021. The Federal
Reserve, the Office
of the Comptroller
of
the
Currency,
and
the
FDIC
also
released
supervisory
guidance
encouraging
banks
to
cease
entering
into
new
contracts
that
use
U.S. Dollar
LIBOR as
reference
rate as
soon as
practicable and
in any
event by
December 31,
2021. Banking
regulators in
the U.S.
and
globally
have
increased
regulatory
scrutiny
and
intensified
supervisory
focus
of
financial
institutions
LIBOR
transition
plans,
preparations and readiness.
Significant
amounts
of
financial
instruments
in
the
market
are
referenced
to
U.S.
Dollar
LIBOR,
and
any
inability
of
market
participants
and
regulators
to
successfully
introduce
benchmark
rates
to
replace
LIBOR
and
implement
effective
transitional
arrangements to
address the
discontinuation of
LIBOR could
result in
disruption in
the financial
markets. In
the U.S.,
the Alternative
Reference Rates
Committee (“ARRC”),
a group
of market
participants convened
by the
Federal Reserve,
recommended the
Secured
Overnight Financing
Rate (“SOFR”) as
a replacement
index for U.S.
Dollar LIBOR-indexed
contracts. SOFR is
an overnight
interest
rate based
on U.S.
Dollar Treasury
repurchase agreements.
On March
2, 2020
the New
York
Fed began
daily publication
of 30,
90,
and 180-day compound
historical averages of
SOFR. In addition,
the ARRC has developed
a detailed supporting framework
for using
SOFR, including
tools such
as fallbacks
and recommended
conventions for
new use
of SOFR in
various products.
On July
29, 2021,
the ARRC
formally
recommended the
Chicago Mercantile
Exchange Group’s
(“CME”) forward-looking
Term
SOFR rates
for one
-,
three-,
six-
and
twelve-month
tenors,
marking
the
final
step
in
the
ARRC’s
Paced
Transition
Plan
it
released
in
2017.
The
ARRC
recommended using
the CME’s
Term
SOFR rates
for cash
products and
derivatives, limited
to end-users
hedging cash
products. An
end-user is
described as
any counterparty
to the underlying
cash product,
such as a
borrower,
lender, or
guarantor.
These parties
may
enter into Term
SOFR rates swaps, caps, swaptions,
or other derivatives to
hedge cash product exposures.
The Corporation may offset
such exposure with an upstream dealer.
The
Corporation
continues
to
execute
its
LIBOR
Transition
workplan.
As
part
of
this
transition
plan,
the
Corporation
started
including fallback language on new and renewed
contracts tied to LIBOR to provide for the determination
of an ARR and had adhered
to the LIBOR Fallbacks Protocol of the International
Swaps and Derivatives Association. In addition, effective
December 31, 2021 the
Corporation discontinued entering
into new contracts that
use the use U.S. Dollar
LIBOR as reference rate.
Currently,
the Corporation
is primarily
offering
CME’s
Term
SOFR rate
as the
ARRs to
LIBOR. The
Bank may
also offer
other industry-accepted
benchmark
interest
rates
that
can
be
supported
for
commercial
transactions.
The
Corporation
continues
working
with
the
update
of
systems,
processes, documentation, and models, with additional updates expected
through 2023.
As of
December 31,
2021, the
most significant
of the
Corporation’s
LIBOR-based assets
and liabilities
consists of
$2.0 billion
of
variable rate
commercial and
construction loans,
approximately $58.4
million of
U.S. agencies
debt securities
and private
label MBS
held as part of
the Corporation’s
available-for-sale investment
securities portfolio, $134.4
million of Puerto Rico
municipalities bonds
held
as
part
of
the
Corporation’s
held-to-maturity
investment
securities
portfolio,
and
$183.8
million
of
junior
subordinated
debentures.
The Corporation
is monitoring
the development
and adoption
of SOFR
and
other
credit sensitive
ARRs and
their liquidity
in the
market. The manner and impact
of the transition from LIBOR to
an ARR, as well as the effect
of these developments on our
loans and
investment securities portfolios, asset-liability management, systems, processes,
and business, is uncertain.
OVERVIEW OF RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
First
BanCorp.'s
results
of
operations
depend
primarily
on
its
net
interest
income,
which
is
the
difference
between
the
interest
income
earned
on
its
interest-earning
assets,
including
investment
securities
and
loans,
and
the
interest
expense
incurred
on
its
interest-bearing
liabilities,
including
deposits
and
borrowings.
Net
interest
income
is
affected
by
various
factors,
including:
(i)
the
interest rate environment;
(ii) the volumes, mix,
and composition of interest-earning
assets and (iii) interest-bearing
liabilities; and the
re-pricing characteristics
of these assets
and liabilities.
The Corporation's
results of operations
also depend
on the provision
for credit
losses,
non-interest
expenses
(such
as
personnel,
occupancy,
the
deposit
insurance
premium
and
other
costs),
non-interest
income
(mainly
service
charges
and
fees
on
deposits,
and
insurance
income),
gains
(losses)
on
sales
of
investments,
gains
(losses)
on
mortgage banking activities, and income taxes.
The
Corporation
had
net
income
of
$281.0
million,
or
$1.31
per
diluted
common
share,
for
the
year
ended
December
31,
2021,
compared to
$102.3 million,
or $0.46
per diluted
common share,
for the
year ended
December 31,
2020. The
Corporation completed
the acquisition
of BSPR effective
September 1,
2020.
The Corporation’s
financial statements
for the
year ended
December 31,
include
four
months
of
BSPR’s
operations,
post-acquisition,
which
impacts
the
comparability
of
the
fiscal
year
results
to
the
fiscal year 2020 results.
Other relevant selected financial data for the periods presented is included below:

The key
drivers of
the Corporation’s
GAAP financial
results for
the year
ended December
31, 202
1, compared
to the
year ended
December 31, 2020, include the following:
●
Net interest income for
the year ended December
31, 2021 was $729.9
million, compared to $600.3
million for the year ended
December
31,
2020.
The increase
was driven
by
a $5.1
billion
increase
in
average
interest-earning
assets reflecting
the
late
third-quarter 2020 acquisition
of BSPR, as well
as higher investment
securities and interest-bearing
cash balances and
a lower
cost
of
deposits.
The
increase
in
net
interest
income
additionally
includes
the
effect
of
approximately
$13.2
million
of
accelerated
deferred
PPP loans
fees
recognized
upon receipt
of forgiveness
payments from
the SBA.
These variances
were
partially offset by the effect of lower market
interest rates on investment yields.
The net
interest margin
decreased by
42 basis
points to
3.73% for
the year
ended December
31, 2021,
compared to
4.15% for
the
year ended
December 31,
2020. The decrease
reflected the impact
of lower
interest rates and
changes in the
balance sheet mix
with a
higher
proportion
of
lower-yielding
assets,
such
as
interest-bearing
cash
deposited
at
the
New
York
Fed
and
investment
securities
from continued
strong deposit growth,
to total interest-earning
assets. The total
average balance
of interest-bearing
cash balances and
investment securities
increased by $3.8 billion
to 42% of
total average interest-earning
assets, compared to
30% in 2020.
In addition,
the proportion
of average
total loan
portfolio balance
to total
average interest-earning
assets in
2021 decreased
to 58%,
compared to
70% in 2020.
See “Net Interest Income” below for additional information.
●
The
provision
for
credit losses
on
loans,
finance
leases, and
debt
securities
decreased
by $236.7
million
to
a net
benefit,
or
provision
recapture,
of $65.7
million
for
the year
ended
December
31,
2021,
compared
to an
expense
of $171.0
million
for
2020. The
variance reflects
the effect
of reserve
releases in
2021, primarily
due to
continued improvements
in the
outlook of
certain
macroeconomic
variables
and
lower
loans
outstanding.
The
expense
recorded
in
included
the
effects
of
significant
reserve
builds due
to the
deterioration
of the
macroeconomic
outlook
as a
result of
the impact
of the
COVID-19
pandemic,
as
well
as
a
charge
of
$38.9
million
related
to the
Day
reserves
required
by
the
current
expected
credit
losses
(“CECL”) methodology
for non-PCD
loans and
unfunded lending
commitments acquired
in conjunction
with the
acquisition
of BSPR.
Net
charge-offs
totaled
$55.1
million
for
the
year
ended
December
31,
2021,
or
0.48%
of
average
loans,
an
increase
of
$7.2
million,
compared
to net
charge-offs
of
$47.9 million,
or 0.48%
of average
loans, for
the year
ended December
31, 2020.
Total
net
charge-offs for
the year ended
December 31,
2021 included $23.1
million in net
charge-offs related
to a bulk
sale of $52.5
million of
residential mortgage
nonaccrual loans and
related servicing advance
receivables.
Adjusted for those
net charge-offs,
total net charge-
offs
in 2021
were $32.0
million, or
0.28% of
average loans.

for Credit
Losses” and

●
The Corporation
recorded non-interest
income of
$121.2 million
for the
year ended
December 31,
2021, compared
to $111.2
million
for
2020.
The
increase
was
primarily
related
to:
(i)
a
$21.6
million
total
increase
in
transactional
fee
income
from
service
charges
and
fees
on
deposits,
ATMs
fees,
credit,
and
debit
cards
and
POS
interchange
fees,
and
merchant-related
activities due
to the
effect
of the
BSPR acquisition
as well
as increased
transaction volumes
due to
the adverse
effect
of the
COVID-19 pandemic and related stay-at-home orders
on economic activity in the first half of 2020; (ii)
a $2.9 million increase
in
revenues
from
mortgage
banking
activities
reflecting
both a
higher volume
of loan
sales and
an
increase
in
servicing
fee
income; and (iii)
a $2.6 million increase
in insurance commissions
income driven by
a higher volume of
loan originations and
higher sell of annuities and accidental death policies.
These variances were partially offset
by: (i) a $13.2 million gain on sales
of investment securities recorded in 2020; and (ii) a $5.0
million benefit recorded in 2020 resulting from
the final settlement of
the Corporation’s
business interruption
insurance
claim associated
with lost
profits
caused
by
Hurricanes Irma
and Maria
in
2017. See “Non-Interest Income” below for additional information.
●
Non-interest expenses
for the year
ended December 31,
2021 were
$489.0 million, compared
to $424.2 million
in 2020. Non-
interest
expenses
for
included
$26.4
million
of
merger
and
restructuring
costs
associated
with
the
acquisition
and
integration
of
BSPR, compared
to
$26.5
million
in
2020.
Total
non-interest
expenses
in
also
included
$3.0
million
of
COVID-19
pandemic-related
expenses,
primarily
related
to
additional
cleaning,
safety
materials,
and
security
measures,
compared to
$5.4 million
in 2020.
Total
non-interest expenses
in 2020
are also
net of
a $1.2
million benefit
from hurricane-
related expenses
insurance recoveries.
Adjusted for
the above-mentioned
merger,
COVID-19 expenses,
and hurricane-related
expenses insurance
recoveries, total
non-interest expenses
increased by
$66.1 million
compared to
2020, primarily
related to
incremental expenses
associated with
operations, personnel
and branches
acquired from
BSPR.
See “Non-Interest
Expenses”
below for additional information.
●
For the year ended December 31,
2021, the Corporation recorded an
income tax expense of $146.8 million,
compared to $14.1
million for 2020.
The increase was primarily
related to higher
pre-tax income driven
by credit losses reserve
releases in 2021,
compared to
significant charges
to the provision
recorded during
2020, and a
higher level of
taxable income.
In addition,
the
income tax expense
reported in 2020
was net of
the effect
of an $8.0
million partial reversal
of the Corporation’s
deferred tax
asset valuation allowance.
●
As of December
31, 2021, total
assets were approximately
$20.8 billion,
an increase of
$2.0 billion from
December 31, 2020.
The
increase
was
primarily
related
to
a
$1.8
billion
increase
in
investment
securities,
driven
by
purchases
of
U.S.
agencies
MBS and U.S. agencies callable
and bullet debentures, and an increase
of $1.0
billion in cash and cash equivalents
attributable
to the liquidity obtained
from the growth in deposits
and loan repayments.
These variances were partially
offset by a decrease
of $731.8
million in total
loans, consisting of
a $558.2
million decrease
in residential mortgage
loans (including
as a result
of
the
bulk
sale
of
$52.5
million
of
nonaccrual
loans),
and
a
$452.0
million
decrease
in
commercial
and
construction
loans
(including
a
$260.9
million
decrease
in
the
SBA
PPP
loan
portfolio),
partially
offset
by
an
increase
of
$278.4
million
in
consumer loans and finance leases.
See “Financial Condition and Operating Data Analysis” below for
additional information.
●
As
of
December
31,
2021,
total
liabilities
were
$18.7
billion,
an
increase
of
$2.2
billion
from
December
31,
2020.
The
increase
was
mainly
driven
by
a
$2.6
billion
growth
in
total
deposits,
excluding
brokered
deposits,
partially
offset
by
the
repayment at maturity of $240.0 million of FHLB advances and a
$93.8 million decrease in brokered deposits.
The increase of
$2.6 million
in non-brokered
deposits included
a $1.6
billion growth
in demand
deposits, as
well as
a $1.2
billion growth
in
government
deposits,
partially
offset
by
reductions
in
time
deposits.

As
of
December
31,
2021,
the
Corporation’s
stockholders’
equity
was
$2.1
billion,
a
decrease
of
$173.4
million
from
December
31,
2020.
The
decrease
was
driven
by
the
approximately
$317.8
million
of
capital
returned
to
the
Corporation’s
stockholders during 2021
consisting of: (i) the repurchase
of 16.7 million shares
of common stock for
a total purchase price of
approximately $213.9 million; (ii) common and preferred
stock dividends totaling $67.8 million; and (iii) the redemption of
all
of its outstanding
shares of Series A
through E Preferred
Stock for its total
liquidation value of
$36.1 million. The
decrease in
total
stockholders’
equity
also
included
the
effect
of
a
$139.5
million
decrease
in
Other
Comprehensive
Income
mostly
attributable to
the decrease
in the
fair value
of available-for-sale
investment securities.
These variances
were partially
offset
by earnings generated
during 2021.
The Corporation
increased
its common
stock dividend twice
during 2021, increasing
the
quarterly
dividend rate
from $0.05
in the
fourth quarter
of 2020
to $0.07
in the
first quarter
of 2021
and $0.10
in the
fourth
quarter of
2021.
The Corporation’s
common
equity tier
1 (“CET1”)
capital, tier
1 capital,
total capital
,
and leverage
ratios
were 17.80%, 17.80%,
20.50%, and 10.14%,
respectively,
as of December
31, 2021, compared
to CET1 capital,
tier 1 capital,
total capital,
and leverage ratios
of 17.31%, 17.61%,

Total
loan
production,
including
purchases,
refinancings,
renewals,
and
draws
from
existing
revolving
and
non-revolving
commitments, but excluding
the utilization activity
on outstanding
credit cards,
was $4.8 billion
for the
year ended
December
31, 2021, compared to $4.2 billion for 2020.
As mentioned above, the Corporation originated
$283.6
million of SBA PPP loans
during 2021, compared to $390.3 million in 2020.
In addition, during the year ended December 31,
2020, the Corporation also
participated in
the Main
Street Lending
Program (“Main
Street”) and
originated approximately $184.4
million of
Main Street
loans.
This program, authorized under
the CARES Act of 2020 and established
by the Federal Reserve, was designed
to support
lending
to
small
and
medium-sized
businesses
that
were
in
sound
financial
condition
before
the
onset
of
the
COVID-19
pandemic. Excluding
SBA PPP
and Main
Street loan
originations, total
loan originations
increased by
$940.9 million
to $4.5
billion in 2021,
compared to $3.6
billion for 2020,
consisting of: (i)
a $510.9
million increase in
commercial and construction
loan originations,
primarily in
the Florida
region; (ii)
a $366.7
million increase
in consumer
loan originations,
predominantly
auto loans and finance leases, reflecting the effect of the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic-related lockdowns and
quarantines;
and
(iii)
a
$63.3
million
increase
in
residential
mortgage
loan
originations,
benefited
from
a
larger
volume
of
conforming loan
originations and
refinancings driven
by the
effect
of lower
mortgage loan
interest rates
and increased
home
purchase activity during 2021.
●
Total
non-performing

were
$158.1
million
as

31,
2021,
a
decrease
of
$135.4
million,
or
46%,
from
December
31,
2020.
The
decrease
was
primarily
related
to:
(i)
a
$70.2
million
decrease
in
nonaccrual
residential
mortgage
loans, primarily
as a
result of
the bulk
sale of
$52.5
million of
nonaccrual loans;
(ii) a
$42.2
million decrease
in the
OREO
portfolio balance, including the sale
of two commercial OREO
properties in the Puerto
Rico region totaling $30.7 million;
(iii)
an
$18.3

decrease
in
nonaccrual
commercial
and

Adversely classified commercial and construction loans increased by $22.1 million to $177.3 million as of
December 31, 2021,
compared to
December 31,
2020. The
increase was
driven by
the downgrade
of four
commercial relationships
totaling $76.5
million. Partially offset by the upgrades
of two commercial relationship in the Puerto
Rico region totaling $31.3 million,
the sale
of $3.1
million construction
loan in
the Puerto
Rico region
and the
sale of
a $15.1
million classified
commercial loan
in the
Florida
region.
The
Corporation
is
closely
monitoring
its

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES
The
accounting
principles
of the
Corporation
and
the
methods
of
applying
these
principles
conform
to
GAAP.
In
preparing
the
consolidated
financial
statements
management
is
required
to
make
estimates,
assumptions,
and
judgments
that
affect
the
amounts
recorded for assets,
liabilities and contingent
liabilities as of
the date of
the financial statements
and the reported
amounts of revenues
and
expenses
during
the
reporting
periods.
The
Corporation’s
critical
accounting
estimates
that
are
particularly
susceptible
to
significant
changes
include:
(i)
the
ACL;
(ii)
valuation
of
financial
instruments;
(iii)
acquired
loans;
and
(iv)
income
taxes.
Actual
results could differ from estimates and assumptions if
different outcomes or conditions prevail.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The Corporation
maintains an ACL
for loans
and finance
leases based upon
management’s
estimate of the
lifetime expected
credit
losses in the loan portfolio, as of the balance sheet date,
excluding loans held for sale. Additionally,
the Corporation maintains an ACL
for
debt
securities
classified
as
either
held-to-maturity
or
available-for-sale,
and
other
off-balance
sheet
credit
exposures
(
e.g.
, unfunded
loan commitments).
For loans
and
finance leases,
unfunded
loan
commitments, and
held-to-maturity
debt
securities,
the
estimate
of
lifetime
credit
losses
includes
the
use
of
quantitative
models
that
incorporate
forward-looking
macroeconomic
scenarios
that
are
applied
over
the
contractual
lives
of
the
portfolios,
adjusted,
as
appropriate,
for
prepayments
and
permitted
extension
options
using
historical
experience.
The
ACL
for
available-for-sale
debt
securities
is
measured
using
a
risk-adjusted
discounted cash flow
approach that also
considers relevant current
and forward-looking economic
variables and the
ACL is limited to
the difference
between the
fair value
of
the security
and its
amortized
cost. Judgment
is specifically
applied
in the
determination of
economic assumptions, the length of
the initial loss forecast period, the
reversion of losses beyond the initial
forecast period, historical
loss expectations, usage of macroeconomic
scenarios, and qualitative factors, which may
not be adequately captured in the
loss model,
as further discussed below.
The macroeconomic
scenarios utilized by
the Corporation include
variables that have
historically been key
drivers of increases and
decreases
in
credit
losses.
These
variables
include,
but
are
not
limited
to,
unemployment
rates,
housing
and
commercial
real
estate
prices, gross domestic
product levels, retail
sales, interest-rate forecasts,
corporate bond spreads,
and changes in
equity market prices.
The
Corporation
derives
the
economic
forecasts
it
uses
in
its
ACL
model
from
Moody's
Analytics.
The
latter
has
a
large
team
of
economists, data-base managers and operational engineers with a history
of producing monthly economic forecasts for over 25 years.
As of December 31, 2021, the Corporation used
the base-case economic scenario from Moody’s
Analytics in its estimation of credit
losses. The Corporation
has currently set
an initial forecast
period (“reasonable
and supportable
period”) of two
years and a
reversion
period of up to three
years, utilizing a straight-line
approach and reverting back
to the historical macroeconomic
mean for Puerto Rico
and the Virgin
Islands regions. For the
Florida region, the methodology
considers a reasonable and
supportable forecast period
and an
implicit
reversion
towards
the historical
trend
that
varies for
each
macroeconomic
variable,
achieving
the steady
state by
year
five.
After the
reversion period,
a historical
loss forecast
period covering
the remaining
contractual life,
adjusted for
prepayments, is
used
based
on
the
change
in
key
historical
economic
variables
during
representative
historical
expansionary
and
recessionary
periods.
Changes in economic forecasts impact
the probability of default (“PD”),
loss-given default (“LGD”), and
exposure at default (“EAD”)
for each instrument,
and therefore influence
the amount of
future cash flows
for each instrument
that the Corporation
does not expect
to collect.
Although
no
one
economic
variable
can
fully
demonstrate
the
sensitivity
of
the
ACL
calculation
to
changes
in
the
economic
variables
used
in
the
model,
the
Corporation
has
identified
certain
economic
variables
that
have
significant
influence
in
the
Corporation’s
model
for
determining
the
ACL.
As
of
December 31,
2021,
the
Corporation’s
ACL
model
considered
the
following
assumptions for key economic variables in the base-case scenario:
●
Average
Commercial
Real Estate
Price Index
year-over-year
appreciation
of approximately
2.90%
in the
first quarter
of
2022,
followed
by
increases
ranging
from
0.52%
-
5.16%
during
the
remainder
of
2022.
The
average
projected
commercial real estate price index appreciation for 2023 is forecasted
at 8.68%.
●
Regional Home
Price Index
in Puerto Rico
(purchase only
prices), year-over-year
increase of
approximately 1.59%
in the
first quarter of 2022,
followed by estimates ranging
from (0.53)% - 2.77%
during the remainder of
2022 and 2023. For the
Florida region
(all transactions, including
refinances), year-over-year
increase of approximately
8.11%, in
the first quarter
of
2022,
followed
by
estimates
ranging
from
(2.42)%
-
2.18%
for
the
Florida
region
during
the
remainder
of 2022
and
2023.
●
Levels
of
regional
unemployment
in
Puerto
Rico
at
approximately
7.60%
in
the
first
quarter
of
2022,
followed
by
improvements
throughout
the
remainder
of
to
an
approximate
level
of
7.32%
by
the
end
of
2022.
For
the
Florida
region and the
U.S. mainland, unemployment
rate of 3.71% and
4.07%, respectively,
in the first
quarter of 2022,
followed
by modest improvements
throughout the
remainder of 2022
to an approximate
level of 2.81%
in Florida and
3.51% in the
U.S. mainland by
the end of
2022. The average
unemployment for the
Puerto Rico, Florida
and the U.S.
mainland regions
for 2023 is forecasted at 7.60%, 2.88%,
and 3.49%, respectively.
●
A year-over-year increase in real gross domestic
product (“GDP”) in the U.S. mainland of approximately 5.33%
in the first
quarter of
2022, followed
by increasing
levels of real
GDP growth
between 2.74%
- 4.54% during
the remainder
of 2022
and 2023.
Further,
the
Corporation
periodically
considers
the
need
for
qualitative
adjustments
to
the
ACL.
Qualitative
adjustments
may
be
related to and include, but not be limited to, factors
such as: (i) management’s assessment
of economic forecasts used in the model and
how
those
forecasts
align
with
management’s
overall
evaluation
of
current
and
expected
economic
conditions;
(ii)
organization
specific
risks
such
as
credit
concentrations,
collateral
specific
risks,
nature,
and
size
of
the
portfolio
and
external
factors
that
may
ultimately impact credit
quality,
and (iii) other
limitations associated
with factors such
as changes in
underwriting and loan
resolution
strategies, among
others. The
qualitative factors
that carried the
most significant
weight as of
December 31,
2021 were
the economic
uncertainty
related
to
the
recent
strain
of
the
COVID-19
virus
and
the
potential
lag
of
recovery
in
certain
industries,
such
as
the
transportation
and hospitality
industries,
and loan
modifications related
to commercial
real estate
loans as
a result
of the
COVID-19
situation. The
qualitative factors
applied at
December 31,
2021, and
the importance
and levels of
the qualitative
factors applied,
may
change in future periods
depending on the level
of changes to items such
as the uncertainty of
economic conditions and management's
assessment of
the level of
credit risk within
the loan portfolio
as a result
of such changes,
compared to the
amount of ACL
calculated
by the model. The evaluation of qualitative factors is inherently imprecise
and requires significant management judgment.
The ACL can also be
impacted by factors outside the Corporation’s
control, which include unanticipated
changes in asset quality of
the portfolio, such as increases in risk rating downgrades in our
commercial portfolio, deterioration in borrower delinquencies or credit
scores in our residential real estate and consumer portfolio.
Further, the current fair value of
collateral is utilized to assess the expected
credit losses when a financial asset is considered to be collateral dependent.
It
is
difficult
to
estimate
how
potential
changes
in
any
one
factor
or
input
might
affect
the
overall
ACL
because
management
considers a
wide variety
of factors
and inputs
in estimating
the ACL.
Changes in
the factors
and inputs
considered may
not occur
at
the
same
rate
and
may
not
be
consistent
across
all
geographies
or
product
types,
and
changes
in
factors
and
inputs
may
be
directionally
inconsistent, such
that improvement
in one
factor or
input may
offset
deterioration
in others.
However,
to demonstrate
the
sensitivity
of
credit
loss
estimates
to
macroeconomic
forecasts
as
of
December
31,
2021,
management
compared
the
modeled
estimates under the base scenario against a more
adverse scenario. Under this adverse scenario,
as an example, average unemployment
rate for
the Puerto
Rico region increases
to 8.75%
for year 2022
and 8.24% dur
ing 2023 compared
to 7.38% and
7.60%, respectively
for the same periods, on the base scenario projection.
To
demonstrate the sensitivity
to key economic
parameters used in
the calculation of
our ACL at December
31, 2021, management
calculated the difference
between our quantitative
ACL and this adverse
scenario. Excluding consideration
of qualitative adjustments,
this sensitivity analysis
would result in
a hypothetical increase
in our ACL
of approximately $40
million at December
31, 2021.
This
analysis
relates
only
to
the
modeled
credit
loss estimates
and
is not
intended
to estimate
changes
in
the overall
ACL as
it does
not
reflect
any
potential
changes
in
other
adjustments
to
the
qualitative
calculation,
which
would
also
be
influenced
by
the
judgment
management
applies to
the modeled
lifetime
loss estimates
to reflect
the uncertainty
and imprecision
of these
modeled
lifetime loss
estimates
based
on
current
circumstances
and
conditions.
Recognizing
that
forecasts
of
macroeconomic
conditions
are
inherently
uncertain,
particularly
in
light
of
the
recent
economic
conditions,
management
believes
that
its
process
to
consider
the
available
information
and
associated
risks
and
uncertainties
is
appropriately
governed
and
that
its
estimates
of
expected
credit
losses
were
reasonable and appropriate for the period ended December 31, 2021.
As of
December 31,
2021, the
total ACL
for loans,
held-to-maturity and
available-for-sale
securities, and
off-balance
sheet credit
exposure decreased to $280.2
million, from $401.1 million
as of December 31, 2020.
The ACL reduction of
$120.9 million during the
year
ended
December
31,
consisted
of
net
charge-offs
of
$55.2
million
and
a
provision
for
credit
losses
net
benefit
of
$65.7
million.
The
provision
for
credit
losses
net
benefit
recorded
during
primarily
reflects
an
improvement
in
the
outlook
of
macroeconomic
variables
to
which
the
reserve
is
correlated,
including
improvements
in
the
commercial
real
estate
price
index
and
unemployment rate forecasts, and the overall decrease
in the size of the residential mortgage and the commercial and construction
loan
portfolios.
Our
process
for
determining
the
ACL
is
further
discussed
in
Note
-
Nature
of
Business
and
Summary
of
Significant
Accounting Policies, to the
accompanying audited consolidated financial
statements included in Item 8
of this Annual Report on Form
10-K.
Valuation
of financial instruments
The measurement
of fair value
is fundamental
to the Corporation’s
presentation of
its financial condition
and results of
operations.
The Corporation
holds debt
and equity
securities, derivatives,
and other
financial instruments
at fair
value. The
Corporation holds
its
investments
and
liabilities
mainly
to manage
liquidity
needs and
interest rate
risks.
The Corporation’s
significant
assets reflected
at
fair value on the Corporation’s financial
statements consisted of available-for-sale investment
securities.
The
Corporation
categorizes
the
fair
value
of
its
available-for-sale
debt
securities
using
a
three-level
hierarchy
for
fair
value
measurements
that
distinguishes
between
market
participant
assumptions
developed
based
on
market
data
obtained
from
sources
independent
of
the
Corporation
(observable
inputs)
and
the
Corporation’s
own
assumptions
about
market
participant
assumptions
developed
based
on
the
best
information
available
in
the
circumstances
(unobservable
inputs).
The
hierarchy
of
inputs
used
in
determining
the
fair
value
maximizes
the
use
of
observable
inputs
and
minimizes
the
use
of
unobservable
inputs
by
requiring
that
observable inputs be
used when available.
The hierarchy level assigned
to each security
in the Corporation’s
investment portfolio was
based on management’s
assessment of the transparency and reliability of the
inputs used to estimate the fair values at the measurement
date. See Note 30
- Fair Value,
to the audited consolidated
financial statements included
in Item 8 of
this Annual Report on
Form 10-
K for additional
information.
The fair
value of
available-for-sale investment
securities was
the market
value based
on quoted
market prices
(as is
the case
with
U.S. Treasury
notes), when
available (Level
1). If
quoted market
prices are
unavailable, the
fair value
is based
on market
prices for
identical
or
comparable
assets
(as
is
the
case
with
MBS
and
callable
U.S.
agency
debt)
that
are
based
on
observable
market
parameters,
including
benchmark
yields,
reported
trades,
quotes
from
brokers
or
dealers,
issuer
spreads,
bids,
offers,
and
reference
data, including
market research
operations (Level
2). Observable
prices in
the market
already consider
the risk
of nonperformance.
If
listed prices or
quotes are not
available, fair value
is based upon
discounted cash
flow models that
use unobservable
inputs due to
the
limited market activity of the instrument, as is the case with private label
MBS held by the Corporation (Level 3).
Private label MBS
are collateralized
by fixed-rate
mortgages on single-family
residential properties
in the U.S.;
the interest rate
on
the securities is variable,
tied to 3-month LIBOR
and limited to the
weighted-average coupon of
the underlying collateral.
The market
valuation represents
the estimated
net cash
flows over
the projected
life of
the pool
of underlying
assets applying
a discount
rate that
reflects market
observed floating
spreads over
LIBOR, with
a widening
spread based
on a nonrated
security.
The market
valuation is
derived
from
a
model
that
utilizes
relevant
assumptions
such
as
the
prepayment
rate,
default
rate,
and
loss
severity
on
a
loan
level
basis. The
Corporation modeled
the cash
flow from
the fixed-rate
mortgage collateral
using
a static
cash flow
analysis according
to
collateral attributes
of the
underlying mortgage
pool (
i.e.
, loan
term, current
balance, note
rate, rate
adjustment type,
rate adjustment
frequency,
rate
caps,
and
others)
in
combination
with
prepayment
forecasts
based
on
historical
portfolio
performance.
The
Corporation models the variable cash flow of the security using the 3-month
LIBOR forward curve.
Under
ASC 326,
adopted on
January
1, 2020,
declines in
fair value
that are
credit-related are
now recorded
on the
balance sheet
through
an
ACL
with
a
corresponding
adjustment
to
earnings
and
declines
that
are
noncredit-related
are
recognized
through
other
comprehensive income/loss.
If the
Corporation intends
to sell a
debt security
in an
unrealized loss
position or
determines that
it is more
likely than
not that
the
Corporation
will be
required
to sell
a debt
security before
it recovers
its amortized
cost basis,
the debt
security is
impaired
and it
is
written down to fair
value with all losses recognized
in earnings.
As of December 31, 2021,
the Corporation did not
intend to sell any
debt securities
in an
unrealized
loss position
and it
is not
more likely
than not
that the
Corporation
will be
required to
sell any
debt
securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis.
For
debt
securities
in
an unrealized
loss position
for
which the
Corporation
does not
intend
to sell
the debt
security
and
it is
not
more likely than
not that the
Corporation will
be required to
sell the debt
security,
the Corporation determines
whether the loss
is due
to
credit-related
factors
or
noncredit-related
factors.
For
debt
securities
in
an
unrealized
loss
position
for
which
the
losses
are
determined to
be the result
of both credit
-related and noncredit-related
factors, the
credit loss is
determined as
the difference
between
the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, and the amortized
cost basis of the debt security.
Available-for-sale
debt securities
held by
the Corporation
at year-end
primarily consisted
of securities
issued by
U.S. government-
sponsored entities
(“GSEs”), and
the aforementioned
private label
MBS.
Given the
explicit and
implicit guarantees
provided by
the
U.S. federal government, the Corporation believes the credit risk
in securities issued by the GSEs is low.
For the year ended December
31,
2021,
the
Corporation
determined
the
credit
losses
for
private
label
MBS
based
on
a
risk-adjusted
discounted
cash
flow
methodology
that
considers
qualitative
and
quantitative
factors
specific
to
the
instruments,
including
PDs
and
LGDs
that
consider,
among
other
things,
historical
payment
performance,
loan-to-value
attributes,
and
relevant
current
and
forward-looking
macroeconomic
variables,
such
as
regional
unemployment
rates
and
the
housing
price
index
obtained
from
the
economic
scenarios
described in the ACL discussion above.
The
Corporation
recognized
a
provision
benefit
on
available-for-sale
debt
securities,
of
$0.1 million
during
the
year
ended
December 31, 2021, compared to $1.6 million provision expense for
the year ended December 31, 2020.
Acquired Loans
Loans
acquired
through
a
purchase
or
a
business
combination
are
recorded
at
their
fair
value
as
of
the
acquisition
date.
The
acquisition method
of accounting
allows for
a measurement
period to
make adjustments
to an
acquisition for
up to
one year
after the
acquisition date
for new
information that
existed at
the acquisition
date but
may not
have been
known or
available at
that time.
The
Corporation
performs
an
assessment
of
acquired
loans
to
first
determine
if
such
loans
have
experienced
more
than
insignificant
deterioration
in credit
quality since
their origination
and thus
should be
classified and
accounted
for as
purchased credit
deteriorated
(“PCD”) loans. For loans that
have not experienced
more than insignificant deterioration
in credit quality since
origination, referred to
as non-PCD loans, the Corporation
records such loans at fair
value, with any resulting
discount or premium accreted
or amortized into
interest income
over the
remaining life
of the
loan using
the interest
method. Additionally,
upon the
purchase or
acquisition of
non-
PCD loans,
the
Corporation
measures
and
records
an
ACL based
on
the Corporation’s
methodology
for
determining
the
ACL.
The
ACL for non-PCD loans is recorded through a charge
to the provision for credit losses in the period in which
the loans were purchased
or acquired.
Acquired loans that
are classified as
PCD are recognized
at fair value.
The ACL estimated
for PCD loans
as of the acquisition
date
is recorded
as a gross
-up of
the loan balance
and the ACL.
Any remaining
discount or
premium after
the gross-up
is then recognized
as an
adjustment to
yield over
the remaining
life of
the loan.
After the
acquisition date,
the accounting
for acquired
loans and
leases,
including
PCD
and
non-PCD
loans,
follows
the
same
accounting
guidance
as
loans
and
leases
originated
by
the
Corporation.
Characteristics
relevant
to
the
classification
of
PCD
loans
include:
delinquency,
payment
history
since
origination,
credit
scores
migration, and/or
other factors
the Corporation
may become
aware of
through its
initial analysis
of acquired
loans that
may indicate
there
has
been
more
than
insignificant
deterioration
in
credit
quality
since
a
loan’s
origination.
In
connection
with
the
BSPR
acquisition
on
September
1,
2020,
the
Corporation
acquired
PCD
loans
and
non-PCD
loans
with
an
aggregate
fair
value
of
approximately $752.8 million and
$1.8 billion, respectively.
The fair value of the
loans acquired from BSPR was estimated
based on a
discounted
cash flow
method under
which the
present value
of the
contractual
cash flows
was calculated
based on
certain valuation
assumptions
such
as
default
rates,
loss
severity,
and
prepayment
rates,
consistent
with
the
Corporation’s
CECL
methodology,
and
discounted using a market
rate of return that accounts
for both the time value
of money and investment
risk factors.
The discount rate
utilized to analyze
fair value considered
the cost of funds
rate, capital charge,
servicing costs, and liquidity
premium, mostly based
on
industry
standards. For
further information,
refer to
Note 2
- Business
Combination
to the
audited consolidated
financial statements
included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
For PCD
loans that,
prior to
the adoption
of CECL,
were classified
as purchased
credit impaired
(“PCI”) loans
and accounted
for
under ASC
Subtopic 310-30,
“Loans and
Debt Securities
Acquired
with Deteriorated
Credit Quality”
(“ASC Subtopic
310-30”), the
Corporation adopted CECL using the prospective
transition approach. As allowed by CECL, the Corporation
elected to maintain pools
of
loans
accounted
for
under
ASC
Subtopic
310-30
as “units
of
accounts,”
conceptually
treating
each
pool
as
a
single
asset.
As
of
December
31,
2021,
such
PCD
loans
consisted
of
$115.1
million
of
residential
mortgage
loans
and
$2.4
million
of
commercial
mortgage loans acquired by
the Corporation as part
of previously completed asset
acquisitions. As the Corporation
elected to maintain
pools of units
of account for
loans previously accounted
for under ASC
Subtopic 310-30,
the Corporation
is not able
to remove loans
from the pools until they are paid off, written
off, or sold (consistent with the Corporation’s
practice prior to adoption of CECL), but is
required
to follow
CECL for
purposes
of the
ACL. Regarding
interest income
recognition for
PCD loans
that existed
at the
time of
adoption of
CECL, the prospective
transition approach
for PCD loans
required by
CECL was applied
at a pool
level, which
froze the
effective interest rate
of the pools as
of January 1, 2020.
According to regulatory guidance,
the determination of nonaccrual
or accrual
status
for
PCD
loans
that
the
Corporation
has
elected
to
maintain
in
previously
existing
pools
pursuant
to
the
policy
election
right
upon
adoption of
CECL should
be made
at the
pool
level, not
the individual
asset level.
In addition,
the guidance
provides
that the
Corporation can continue accruing
interest and not report the
PCD loans as being in
nonaccrual status if the following
criteria are met:
(i) the Corporation can reasonably estimate the timing
and amounts of cash flows expected to be collected,
and (ii) the Corporation did
not acquire the asset primarily for
the rewards of ownership of the underlying
collateral, such as for use in operations
or improving the
collateral
for
resale.
Thus,
the
Corporation
continues
to
exclude
these
pools
of
PCD
loans
from
nonaccrual
loan
statistics.
In
accordance
with
CECL,
the
Corporation
did
not
reassess
whether
modifications
to
individual
acquired
loans
accounted
for
within
pools were TDR as of the date of adoption.
Income Taxes
The Corporation is required to estimate income taxes in preparing
its consolidated financial statements. This involves the estimation
of
current
income
tax
expense
together
with
an
assessment
of
temporary
differences
between
the
carrying
amounts
of
assets
and
liabilities
for
financial
reporting
purposes
and
the
amounts
used
for
income
tax
purposes.
The
determination
of
current
income
tax
expense
involves
estimates
and
assumptions
that
require
the
Corporation
to
assume
certain
positions
based
on
its
interpretation
of
current tax regulations. Management assesses the relative benefits
and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions, taking
into
account statutory,
judicial and regulatory
guidance, and recognizes
tax benefits
only when deemed
probable. Changes
in assumptions
affecting estimates
may be required
in the future
and estimated tax
liabilities may need
to be increased
or decreased accordingly.
The
Corporation
adjusts the
accrual of
tax contingencies
in light
of changing
facts and
circumstances, such
as the
progress of
tax audits,
case law
and emergi
ng legislation.
The Corporation’s
effective tax
rate includes
the impact
of tax
contingencies and
changes to
such
accruals,
as
considered
appropriate
by
management.
When
particular
tax
matters
arise,
a
number
of
years
may
elapse
before
such
matters are
audited by
the taxing
authorities and
finally resolved.
Favorable resolution
of such matters
or the
expiration of
the statute
of limitations may result in the release of tax contingencies that
the Corporation recognizes as a reduction to its effective
tax rate in the
year of resolution.
Unfavorable settlement
of any particular
issue could increase
the effective
tax rate and
may require the
use of cash
in the year of resolution.
The
determination
of
deferred
tax
expense
or
benefit
is
based
on
changes
in
the
carrying
amounts
of
assets
and
liabilities
that
generate
temporary differences.
The carrying
value
of the
Corporation’s
net deferred
tax asset
assumes
that the
Corporation
will be
able
to
generate
sufficient
future
taxable
income
based
on
estimates
and
assumptions.
If
these
estimates
and
related
assumptions
change, the
Corporation may
be required
to record valuation
allowances against
its deferred
tax assets, resulting
in additional
income
tax expense
in the
consolidated statements
of income.
Management evaluates
its deferred
tax assets
on a
quarterly basis
and assesses
the need
for a valuation
allowance, if any.
A valuation allowance
is established when
management believes
that it is
more likely
than
not that
some portion
of its
deferred tax
assets will
not be
realized. The
determination of
whether a
valuation allowance
for deferred
tax assets
is appropriate
is subject to
considerable judgment
and requires
the evaluation
of positive
and negative
evidence that
can be
objectively
verified.
Positive
evidence
necessary
to
overcome
the
negative
evidence
includes
whether
future
taxable
income
in
sufficient
amounts
and
character
within
the
carryforward
periods
is available
under
the tax
law.
Consideration
must
be given
to
all
sources
of
taxable
income,
including,
as
applicable,
the
future
reversal
of
existing
temporary
differences,
future
taxable
income
forecasts exclusive
of the
reversal of
temporary
differences and
carryforwards,
and tax
planning strategies.
When negative
evidence
(e.g.,
cumulative
losses
in
recent
years,
history
of
operating
loss
or
tax
credit
carryforwards
expiring
unused)
exists,
more
positive
evidence
than negative
evidence will
be necessary.
The Corporation
has concluded
that based
on the
level of
positive evidence,
it is
more
likely
than not
that the
deferred
tax asset
will be
realized,
net of
the existing
valuation allowances
at December
31,
2021 and
2020. However,
there is
no guarantee
that the
tax benefits
associated with
the deferred
tax assets
will be
fully realized.
The positive
evidence
considered by
management in
arriving at
its conclusion
included factors
such as:
FirstBank’s
four-year
cumulative income
position;
sustained
periods
of
profitability;
management’s
proven
ability
to
forecast
future
income
accurately
and
execute
tax
strategies; forecasts
of future
profitability
under several
potential scenarios
that support
the partial
utilization of
NOLs prior
to their
expiration
from
through
2024;
and
the
utilization
of
NOLs
over
the
past
four-years.
The
negative
evidence
considered
by
management
included:
uncertainties
about
the
state
of
the
Puerto
Rico
economy,
including
considerations
relating
to
the
effect
of
hurricane and pandemic
recovery funds together
with Puerto Rico government
debt restructuring and
the ultimate sustainability
of the
latest fiscal plan certified by the PROMESA oversight board.
Refer to Note
28 - Income
Taxes,
to the audited
consolidated financial
statements included
in Item 8
of this Form
10-K for further
information related to Income Taxes.
OTHER ESTIMATES
In addition
to the
critical accounting
estimates we
make in connection
with the
ACL, fair
value measurements,
and the accounting
for income taxes,
goodwill and identifiable
intangible assets, pension
and postretirement benefit
obligations, and provisions
for losses
that
may
arise
from
litigation
and
regulatory
proceedings
(including
governmental
investigations)
are
also
based
on
estimates
and
assumptions.
Goodwill is assessed
for impairment
annually in the
fourth quarter or
more frequently
if events occur
or circumstances change
that
indicate an
impairment may
exist. When
assessing goodwill
for impairment,
first, a
qualitative assessment
can be
made to
determine
whether it is more
likely than not that
the estimated fair value
of a reporting unit
is less than its estimated
carrying value. If the results
of the
qualitative assessment
are not
conclusive, a
quantitative goodwill
test is
performed. Alternatively,
a quantitative
goodwill test
can
be
performed
without
performing
a
qualitative
assessment.
Identifiable
intangible
assets
are
tested
for
impairment
whenever
events or
changes in
circumstances suggest
that an
asset’s
or asset
group’s
carrying value
may not
be fully
recoverable. Judgment
is
required
to
evaluate
whether
indications
of
potential
impairment
have
occurred,
and
to
test
intangible
assets
for
impairment,
if
required. The
amortization of identified
intangible assets recognized
in a business
combination is based
upon the
estimated economic
benefits
to
be
received
over
their
economic
life,
which
is

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
Net Interest Income
Net interest
income is
the excess of
interest earned
by First BanCorp.
on its interest-earning
assets over
the interest
incurred on its
interest-bearing
liabilities.
First
BanCorp.’s
net
interest
income
is
subject
to
interest
rate
risk
due
to
the
repricing
and
maturity
mismatch of
the Corporation’s
assets and
liabilities.
Net interest
income for
the year
ended December
31, 2021
was $729.9
million,
compared to $600.3
million for 2020.
On a tax-equivalent basis
and excluding the
changes in the fair
value of derivative instruments,
net
interest
income
for
the
year
ended
December
31,
was
$753.7
million
compared
to
$621.4
million
for
the
year
ended
December 31, 2020.
The
following
tables
include a
detailed
analysis
of net
interest income
for
the indicated
periods.
Part I
presents
average volumes
(based
on
the
average
daily
balance)
and
rates
on
an
adjusted
tax-equivalent
basis
and
Part
II
presents,
also
on
an
adjusted
tax-
equivalent basis,
the extent
to which
changes in
interest rates
and changes
in the
volume of
interest-related assets
and liabilities
have
affected
the Corporation’s
net interest
income. For
each category
of interest-earning
assets and
interest-bearing
liabilities, the
tables
provide
information
on
changes
in
(i)
volume
(changes
in
volume
multiplied
by
prior
period
rates)
and
(ii)
rate
(changes
in
rate
multiplied by
prior period
volumes). The
Corporation has
allocated rate-volume
variances (changes
in rate
multiplied by
changes in
volume) to either the changes in volume or the changes in rate based upon
the effect of each factor on the combined totals.
Net
interest
income
on
an
adjusted
tax-equivalent
basis and
excluding
the
change
in the
fair
value
of
derivative
instruments
is a
non-GAAP
financial
measure.

On an adjusted

Corporation estimated the adjusted
tax-equivalent yield by
dividing the interest
rate spread on
exempt assets by
1 less
the Puerto
Rico statutory
tax rate
of 37.5%
and adding
to it
the cost
of interest
-bearing liabilities.
The tax-equivalent
adjustment
recognizes
the income
tax
savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets.
Management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry
to present net interest income,
interest
rate
spread
and
net
interest
margin
on
a
fully
tax-equivalent
basis.
Therefore,
management
believes
these
measures
provide
useful
information
to
investors by
allowing
them to
make
peer comparisons.
The Corporation
excludes
changes
in the
fair value
of derivatives
from interest
income and
interest
expense because the changes in valuation do not affect
interest received or paid.

Portions of the Corporation’s
interest-earning assets, mostly investments
in obligations of some U.S.
government agencies and U.S.
government-sponsored
entities (“GSEs”),
generate interest
that is
exempt from
income tax,
principally in
Puerto Rico.
Also, interest
and gains
on sales of
investments held by
the Corporation’s
international banking
entities (“IBEs”) are
tax-exempt under
Puerto Rico
tax law
(see “Income
Taxes”
below for
additional information).
Management believes
that the
presentation of
interest income
on an
adjusted
tax-equivalent
basis facilitates
the comparison
of all
interest data
related to
these assets.
The Corporation
estimated the
tax
equivalent yield by dividing the interest rate spread on exempt
assets by 1 less the Puerto Rico statutory tax rate (37.5%) and
adding to
it the average
cost of interest-bearing
liabilities. The computation
considers the interest
expense disallowance required
by Puerto Rico
tax law.
Management
believes
that
the
presentation
of
net
interest
income
excluding
the
effects
of
the
changes
in
the
fair
value
of
the
derivative
instruments
(“valuations”)
provides
additional
information
about
the
Corporation’s
net
interest
income
and
facilitates
comparability and analysis from
period to period. The changes
in the fair value of
the derivative instruments have
no effect on interest
due on interest-bearing liabilities or interest earned on interest-earning
assets.
The following table reconciles net interest income in accordance with
GAAP to net interest income, excluding valuations, and net
interest income on an adjusted tax-equivalent basis for the indicated periods.
The table also reconciles net interest spread and net
interest margin on a GAAP basis to these items excluding valuations, and

Interest
income
on
interest-earning
assets
primarily
represents
interest
earned
on
loans
held
for
investment
and
investment
securities.
Interest
expense
on
interest-bearing
liabilities
primarily
represents
interest
paid
on
brokered
CDs,
retail
deposits,
repurchase
agreements, advances from the FHLB, and junior subordinated debentures.
Unrealized
gains or
losses on
derivatives
represent
changes in
the
fair value
of derivatives,
primarily
interest
rate
caps used
for
protection against rising interest rates.
Net
interest
income
amounted
to
$729.9
million
for
the
year
ended
December
31,
2021,
an
increase
of
$129.6
million,
when
compared to $600.3
million for the
year ended December
31, 2020.
The $129.6 million
increase in net
interest income was
primarily
due to:
●
A $47.4 million
increase
in interest
income on
commercial
and construction
loans, mainly
due to an $853.2
million
increase
in the
average balance
of this portfolio
that reflects
the effect of both
loans acquired
in conjunction
with the BSPR acquisition
and SBA
PPP loans originated
through 2020
and 2021. Total discount
accretion
related to
fair value
marks on commercial
and construction
loans acquired
in the BSPR
acquisition
amounted
to $9.2 million
in 2021,
compared
to $5.5 million
in 2020. Additionally,
interest
income
for
includes
$20.9
million
earned
on
SBA
PPP
loans,
including $13.2
million
of
accelerated PPP
loan
fees
recognized upon
receipt of forgiveness
payments in 2021, compared
to $7.5 million interest
income on SBA PPP loans recorded
in 2020. This variance also reflects
the benefit of interest income
of $2.9 million realized from deferred
interest recognized
on a
construction
loan paid-off
in 2021.
These variances
were partially
offset by lower
interest rates.
As of December
31, 2021, the interest
rate on approximately
39% of
the Corporation’s commercial
and construction loans, excluding
SBA PPP loans, was based upon LIBOR indices and 16% was
based upon the Prime rate index.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the average
one-month LIBOR rate declined
42 basis
points,
the
average three-month
LIBOR
rate
declined 49
basis
points,
and
the
average Prime
rate
declined 29
basis
points
compared
to the
average
rate of
such indices
in 2020.
●
A $29.5 million increase
in interest income
on consumer loans
and finance leases,
mainly due to a $333.5 million
increase in the
average balance
of this portfolio,
largely related to
auto loans and finance
leases. The increase
in the average balance
reflects the
effect of
both consumer
loans acquired
in connection
with the
BSPR acquisition
and organic
growth.
●
A $27.9 million decrease in total interest expense, primarily due to: (i) a $21.9 million decrease in interest expense on interest-
bearing checking, savings and non-brokered time deposits, primarily
related to the effect
of lower rates paid
in response to the
current level of the Federal Fund target
rate that more than offset the effect
of the $2.7 billion increase in average
balance; (ii) a
$5.0 million
decrease
in interest
expense on
brokered
CDs, primarily
related to
the $216.0
million decrease
in the average
balance
in
related deposits; (iii)
a
$3.1 million
decrease in
interest expense on
FHLB advances, primarily related
to
a
$151.4 million
decrease
in
the
average
balance
of
FHLB
advances;
and
(iv)
a
$1.2
million
decrease
in
interest
expense
related
to
the
downward
repricing of
floating-rate junior
subordinated debentures
tied to
the three-month
LIBOR index.
These variances
were partially
offset by
a $3.3 million
increase in interest
expense on
repurchase agreements
primarily related
to the upward
repricing
of
$200
million
repurchase
agreements
(flipper
repos)
for
which
its
interest
rate
changed
early
in
from
variable rates tied to 3-month LIBOR to a fixed rate of 3.90%.
●
A
$
11.3
million increase in
interest income on
residential mortgage loans,
primarily related to
a
$157.7 million
increase the
average
balance of
this portfolio,
primarily
related
to loans
acquired
in the BSPR
acquisition.
●
An $14.3 million increase in interest income on
investment securities,
driven by a
$3.0 billion increase in the average balance,
primarily U.S. agencies
MBS and
debt securities,
partially offset
by higher
premium amortization
expense related
to higher
prepayment rates of U.S. agencies MBS and lower reinvestment yields.
Partially offset by:
●
A $0.7 million decrease
in interest income
from interest-bearing
cash balances,
which consisted
primarily of deposits
maintained
at
the
New
York
Fed.
Balances at
the
New
York
Fed
earned 0.13%
during 2021,
compared to
0.44%
in
2020,
a
decrease
attributable to declines
in the Federal Funds target rate in the latter part of the first quarter of 2020. The adverse effect of lower
rates was
partially
offset by a $753.9
million increase
in the average
balance of
interest-bearing
cash balances,
primarily
related to
the strong
growth in
deposits.
The net
interest margin
decreased by
42 basis
points to
3.73% for
2021, compared
to 4.15%
for 2020.
The decrease
for the
periods was
primarily attributable
to a
higher proportion
of lower-yielding
assets, such
as interest-bearing
cash deposited
at the
New
York
Fed and investment securities from
continued strong deposit growth,
to total interest-earning assets. The
total average balance of
interest-bearing
cash
balances
and
investment
securities
increased
by $3.8
billion
to
42%
of
total
average
interest-earning
assets,
compared to 30% for the same period of 2020.
Provision for Credit Losses
The provision for credit
losses consists of provisions for
credit losses on loans and
finance leases, unfunded loan
commitments, and
held-to-maturity and available-for-sale debt securities.
The principal changes in the provision for credit losses by main categories
follow:
Provision for credit losses for
loans and finance leases
The provision for credit losses for loans and finance
leases decreased by $230.4 million to a net benefit of $61.7
million for the year
ended
December 31,
2021,
compared
to
an expense
of $168.7
million
for 2020.
The results
for
the year
ended December
31, 2020
included
a
$37.5
million
Day
provision
for
credit
losses
related
to
non-PCD
loans
acquired
in
conjunction
with
the
BSPR
acquisition. Meanwhile, the provision
for credit losses for year 2020 do not
include $28.7 million of reserves established
at acquisition
date for
PCD loans
acquired
in conjunction
with the
BSPR acquisition.
Unlike non-PCD
loans, the
initial ACL
for PCD
loans was
established through an adjustment
to the acquired loan balance
and not through a charge
to the provision for credit
losses in the period
in which the loans were acquired. The variances by major portfolio
category are as follow:
●
Provision for credit losses for
the commercial and construction
loans portfolio was a net
benefit of $65.3 million
for the year
ended December 31,
2021, compared to
an expense of
$89.9 million for
the year ended
December 31, 2020.
The net benefit
recorded
in
2021,
reflects
continued
improvements
in
the
long-term
outlook
of
forecasted
macroeconomic
variables,
primarily
in the
commercial real
estate price
index, and
the overall
decrease in
the size
of this
portfolio in
the Puerto
Rico
region. The significant reserve builds
in the prior year were due to
the deterioration in forecasted economic
conditions due to
the COVID-19 pandemic reflected across multiple sectors with higher
increases in the ACL made for loans in the hospitality,
office and
retail real
estate industries.
The expense
for the year
2020 included
a $13.8 million
Day 1
provision recorded
for
non-PCD commercial and construction loans acquired in conjunction with
the BSPR acquisition.
●
Provision for credit
losses for the
consumer loan and
finance lease portfolio
was $20.6 million
for the year
ended December
31, 2021, compared
to $56.4 million for
the year ended December
31, 2020. The charges
to the provision
in 2021 reflect the
effect of increases
in cumulative historical
charge-off levels related
to the credit card
and personal loan portfolios,
as well as
charges to
the provision
for auto loans
and finance
leases that, among
other things, accounted
for the overall
increase in the
size of
these portfolios.
The significant
reserve builds
in the
prior year
were due
to the
deterioration of
the macroeconomic
outlook as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic primarily reflected in auto loans,
finance leases, and credit card loans,
as well
as
a
$10.1
million
Day
provision
recorded
for
non-PCD
consumer
loans
acquired
in
conjunction
with
the
BSPR
acquisition.
●
Provision
for
credit losses
for
the residential
mortgage
loan portfolio
was a
net benefit
of $17.0
million
for the
year ended
December
31,
2021,
compared
to
an
expense
of
$22.4
million
for
the
year
ended
December
31,
2020.
The
net
benefit
recorded
in 2021
reflects the
effect
of both
continued improvements
in the
long-term
outlook
of macroeconomic
variables,
such as regional unemployment rates
and Home Price Index, and the overall
portfolio decrease. The significant reserve builds
in the
prior year
were due
to the
deterioration of
the macroeconomic
outlook
as a
result of
the COVID-19
pandemic
and a
$13.6
million
Day
provision
recorded
for
non-PCD
residential
mortgage
loans
acquired
in
conjunction
with
the
BSPR
acquisition.

Provision for credit losses for
unfunded loan commitments
The provision for
credit losses for
unfunded commercial and
construction loan commitments
and standby letters
of credit was a
net
benefit of
$3.6 million
for the year
ended December
31, 2021,
compared to
a charge
of $1.2
million recorded
for the
year 2020.
The
net
benefit
recorded
in
periods
was
mainly
related
to
continued
improvements
in
forecasted
macroeconomic
variables.
The
provision
recorded
in
primarily
consisted
of
a
$1.3
million
charge
recorded
in
connection
with
unfunded
loan
commitments
assumed in the BSPR acquisition.
Provision for credit losses for
held-to-maturity and available-for-sale debt
securities
As of
December 31,
2021, the
held-to-maturity
debt securities
portfolio
consisted of
Puerto Rico
municipal bonds.
The provision
for credit losses for
held-to-maturity securities was
a net benefit of
$0.2 million for the
year ended December 31,
2021, compared to a
benefit of
$0.6 million
for year
ended December
31, 2020.
The net
benefit recorded
in 2021
was mainly
related to
improvements in
forecasted macroeconomic variables
and the repayment of
certain bonds, partially
offset by changes
in some issuers’ financial
metrics
based
on
their most
recent
financial
statements.
The
net
benefit
recorded
in 2020
was primarily
related
to the
repayment
of
certain
bonds.
In
the
third
quarter
of
2020,
the
Corporation
recorded
a
$1.3
million
initial
reserve
for
PCD
debt
securities
acquired
in
conjunction
with
the
BSPR acquisition.
Similar
to
PCD loans,
such
initial
reserve
for PCD
debt
securities
acquired
in
conjunction
with
the
BSPR
acquisition
was
not
established
through
a
charge
to
the
provision
for
credit
losses,
but
rather
through
an
initial
adjustment
to
the
debt
securities’
amortized
cost
basis.
Meanwhile,
the
ACL
for
available-for-sale
securities
of
$1.1
million
as
of
December 31, 2021 remained
relatively unchanged since the
beginning of the year.
The Corporation recorded charges
to the provision
for
credit
losses
for
available-for-sale
securities
of
$1.6
million
during
2020.
These
charges
were
in
connection
with
private
label
MBS and a residential mortgage
pass-through MBS issued by
the PRHFA
and resulted from a
decline in the present value
of expected
cash
flows
based
upon
the
performance
of
the
underlying
mortgages
and
the
effect
of
a
deterioration
in
forecasted
economic
conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

-
Total
$
121,164
$
111,226
Non-interest
income
primarily
consists
of
income
from
service
charges
on
deposit
accounts,
commissions
derived
from
various
banking and insurance activities, gains and losses on
mortgage banking activities, interchange and other
fees related to debit and credit
cards, and net gains and losses on investment securities.
Service charges
on deposit
accounts include
monthly fees,
overdraft fees,
and other
fees on
deposit accounts,
as well
as corporate
cash management fees.
Income
from
mortgage
banking
activities
includes
gains
on
sales
and
securitizations
of
loans,
revenues
earned
for
administering
residential
mortgage
loans
originated
by
the
Corporation
and
subsequently
sold
with
servicing
retained,
and
unrealized
gains
and
losses
on
forward
contracts
used
to
hedge
the
Corporation’s
securitization
pipeline.
In
addition,
lower-of-cost-or-market
valuation
adjustments to
the Corporation’s
residential mortgage
loans held-for-sale
portfolio and
servicing rights
portfolio, if
any,
are recorded
as part of mortgage banking activities.
Insurance
income consists
mainly of
insurance
commissions
earned by
the Corporation’s
subsidiary, FirstBank
Insurance
Agency, Inc.
The other operating
income category
is composed of miscellaneous
fees such as debit, credit
card and POS interchange
fees, as well as
contractual
shared
revenues
from merchant
contracts.
The
net gain
(loss)
on investment
securities
reflects
gains or
losses as
a
result
of sales
that
are
consistent with
the
Corporation’s
investment policies.
The gain
on early
extinguishment
of debt
is related
to the
repurchase in
2020 of
$0.4 million
in TRuPs
of FBP
Statutory
Trust
I.
The
Corporation
repurchased
TRuPs
resulted
in
a
commensurate
reduction
in
the
related
amount
of
the
floating
rate
junior
subordinated debentures
(“Subordinated Debt”).
The Corporation’s
purchase price equated
to 75% of
the $0.4 million
par value.
The
25%
discount
resulted
in
a
gain
of
$0.1
million
which
is
reflected
in
the
consolidated
statements
of
income
as
a
Gain
on
early
extinguishment of debt. As of December 31, 2021, the
Corporation still had Subordinated Debt outstanding in
the aggregate amount of
$183.8 million.
Non-interest income amounted
to $121.2 million
for the year ended
December 31, 2021, compared
to $111
.2 million for 2020.
The
$10.0 million increase in non-interest income was primarily due
to:
●
A
$10.7
million
increase
in
service
charges
on
deposits
accounts, driven
by
the
income
generated
by
the
acquired
BSPR
operations,
primarily
reflecting
an
increase
in
the
number
of
cash
management
transactions
of
commercial
clients,
and
an
increase in the monthly service fee charged on certain checking
and savings products.
●
A $2.9 million increase in
revenues from mortgage banking activities,
driven by a $2.9 million incre
ase in service fee income
and a $1.8 million
increase in realized gain
on sales of residential
mortgage loans in
the secondary market, partially
offset by
a $1.1 million decrease related to the net change in mark-to-market
gains and losses from both interest rate lock commitments
and
To-Be-Announced
(“TBA”)
MBS
forward
contracts
and
a
$0.9
million
increase
in
net
amortization
and
impairment
charges related to
mortgage servicing rights. Total
loans sold in the secondary
market to U.S. GSEs during
2021 amounted to
$519.6 million,
with a
related net
gain of
$20.0 million
(net of
realized losses
of $0.9
million on
TBA hedges,
compared to
total loans
sold in
the secondary
market in
2020 of
$476.4 million,
with a
related net
gain of
$18.1 million
(net of
realized
losses of $2.0 million on TBA hedges).
●
A
$7.1
million
increase
in
Other
operating
income
in
the
table
above,
primarily
reflecting:
(i)
a
$10.9
million
increase
in
transactional fee
income from credit
and debit
cards, ATMs,
POS, and
merchant-related activity
reflecting both
the effect
of
the BSPR
acquisition
as well
as increased
transaction volumes
due to
the impact
of the
COVID-19
pandemic on
economic
activity
in
2020;
(ii)
a
$1.0
million
increase
in
fees
and
commissions
from
other
banking
services
such
as
wire
transfers,
insurance
referrals,
and
official
checks;
and
(iii)
a
$0.7
million
increase
in
non-deferrable
loan
fees,
such
as
unused
commitment loan
fees. These
variances were
partially offset
by the
effect of
the $5.0
million benefit
recorded in
the second
quarter of 2020
resulting from the
final settlement of
the Corporation’s
business interruption
insurance claim associated
with
lost profits caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017.
●
A $2.6
million increase in insurance
income, driven by higher property
insurance commissions, impacted by
a higher volume
of residential
mortgage loan
originations during
2021, when
compared to
2020, and
higher sells
of annuities
and accidental
death policies.
The above-described
increases were
partially offset
by the
effect in
2020 of
a $13.2
million gain
on sales
of investment
securities
consisting
of: (i)
a $13.0
million gain
on sales
of approximately
$392.2
million on
available-for-sale
U.S. agencies
MBS; and
(ii) a
$0.2 million gain on sales of approximately $803.3 million of available
-for-sale U.S. Treasury notes acquired
in the BSPR acquisition.

Included in non-interest expenses are the following Special Items:
●
Merger and
restructuring costs
associated with
the acquisition
of BSPR of
$26.4 million
in 2021,
compared to
$26.5 million
for 2020. These
costs in 2021 primarily
included charges related
to voluntary and
involuntary employee separation
programs
implemented
in
the
Puerto
Rico
region,
as
well
as
consulting
fees,
expenses
related
to
system
conversions,
and
other
integration related efforts, such
as service contracts cancellation penalties, accelerated
depreciation charges related to
planned
closures,
and consolidation of branches in accordance with the Corporation’s
integration and restructuring plan.
●
COVID-19 pandemic-related expenses of $3.0 million in 2021
,
compared
to
$5.4
million
in
2020.
In
these
costs
primarily
consisted
of:
(i)
expenses
of
$2.6
million
associated
with
cleaning
and
security
protocols,
included
as
part
of
Occupancy and
equipment costs
in the
table above;
(ii) $0.3
million in
sales and
use taxes,
included as
part of
Taxes,
other
than income taxes in the table above;
and (iii) expenses of $0.1 million in
connection with employee-related expenses such
as
expenses for
the administration
and referrals
of COVID-19
tests, recorded
as part
of Employees’
compensation and
benefits
in the table
above.
For the year ended
December 31, 2020, these
costs primarily
consisted of: (i)
expenses of $1.8
million in
connection with bonuses
paid to branch personnel
and other essential employees
for working during the
pandemic, as well as
employee-related expenses
such as
expenses for
the administration
of COVID-19
tests, and
purchases of
personal protective
materials,
recorded
as
part
of
Employees’
compensation
and
benefits
in
the
table
above
;
(ii)
expenses
of
$2.7
million
associated with
cleaning and
security protocols,
included as
part of
Occupancy and
equipment costs
in the

●
Benefit from
hurricane-related expenses
insurance recoveries
recorded as
contra-expense in
2020 amounting
to $1.2 million,
primarily related to repairs and
maintenance expenses, included as
a contra expense of Occupancy
and equipment costs in the
table above.
On
a
non-GAAP
basis,
adjusted
non-interest
expenses,
excluding
the
effect
of
the
Special
Items
mentioned
above,
amounted
to
$459.6 million for 2021, compared
to $393.5 million for 2020.
The $66.1 million increase in adjusted
non-interest expenses primarily
reflects the effect of operations,
personnel, and branches acquired from
BSPR. Some of the most significant variances
in adjusted non-
interest expenses follows:
●
A
$25.1
million
increase
in
adjusted
employees’
compensation
and
benefit
expenses,
primarily
driven
by
incremental
expenses related to personnel retained from the acquisition of BSPR.
●
A
$17.9
million
increase
in
adjusted
occupancy
and
equipment
expenses,
primarily related
to
incremental
expenses
associated with
the BSPR
acquired
operations including,
among others,
depreciation, software
maintenance, electricity,
and
rental expenses.
●
A $7.2 million
increase in
adjusted professional
service fees,
including an
increase of
approximately $7.0
million related
to
temporary technology
processing costs of
the acquired BSPR
operations up
to the completion
of system conversions
early in
the third quarter
of 2021, and
a $0.7 million
increase in consulting
and legal fees.
These variances were,
partially offset
by a
$0.5 million decrease in attorneys’ collection fees, appraisals, and other credit-related
fees.
●
A $
9.6
million
increase
in adjusted
Other
non-interest
expense,
in
the table
above, including
a
$5.5
million increase
in
the
amortization
of
intangible
assets, primarily
associated
with
the
intangibles
assets
recognized
in
connection
with
the
BSPR
acquisition,
and
a
$2.8
million
increase
in
insurance
and
supervisory
expenses,
primarily
associated
with
higher
costs
on
insurance policies.
●
A
$4.4
million
increase
in
adjusted
taxes,
other
than
income
taxes
expenses,
primarily
related
to
incremental
municipal
license taxes and property taxes of the acquired operations.
●
A $3.6
million increase
in adjusted
business promotion
expenses, primarily
related to
a $2.4
million increase
in advertising,
marketing, and public relations activities, and a $1.1 million increase in the
cost of the credit card rewards program.
●
A
$3.0
million
increase
in
credit
and
debit
card
processing
expenses, primarily
related
to
incremental
expenses
of
the
acquired
operations
and higher
transaction volumes
due to
the effect
of the
COVID-19 pandemic
on economic
activity last
year.
●
A
$1.0
million
increase
in
communication
expenses, primarily
related
to
incremental
expenses
on
telephone,
data,
and
postage related to the acquired operations.
The above-described increases were
partially offset by a $5.8
million decrease in the net
loss on OREO operations, primarily
due to
higher realized gains on sales of residential and commercial OREO properties.
Income Taxes
Income
tax
expense
includes
Puerto
Rico
and
USVI
income
taxes,
as
well
as
applicable
U.S.
federal
and
state
taxes.
The
Corporation
is
subject
to
Puerto
Rico
income
tax
on
its
income
from
all
sources.
As
a
Puerto
Rico
corporation,
First
BanCorp.
is
treated
as
a
foreign
corporation
for
U.S.
and
USVI
income
tax
purposes
and,
accordingly,
is
generally
subject
to
U.S.
and
USVI
income tax only
on its income
from sources
within the U.S.
and USVI or
income effectively
connected with
the conduct of
a trade or
business in
those jurisdictions.
Any such
tax paid
in the
U.S. and
USVI is
also creditable
against the
Corporation’s
Puerto Rico
tax
liability, subject to certain
conditions and limitations.
Under the
Puerto Rico Internal
Revenue Code
of 2011,
as amended (the
“2011 PR
Code”), the
Corporation and
its subsidiaries are
treated
as
separate
taxable
entities
and
are
not
entitled
to
file
consolidated
tax
returns
and,
thus,
the
Corporation
is
generally
not
entitled to utilize
losses from one
subsidiary to offset
gains in another
subsidiary.
Accordingly,
in order to
obtain a tax
benefit from
a
NOL, a
particular subsidiary
must be
able to
demonstrate sufficient
taxable income
within the
applicable NOL
carry-forward period.
Pursuant to
the 2011
PR Code, the
carry-forward period
for NOLs incurred
during taxable years
that commenced
after December
31,
2004 and ended before January 1, 2013 is 12 years;
for NOLs incurred during taxable years commencing after
December 31, 2012, the
carryover
period
is
years.
The
PR
Code
provides
a
dividend
received
deduction
of
100%
on
dividends
received
from
“controlled” subsidiaries subject to taxation in Puerto Rico and 85% on
dividends received from other taxable domestic corporations.
The
Corporation
has
maintained
an
effective
tax
rate
lower
than
the
maximum
statutory
rate
of
37.5%
mainly
by
investing
in
government
obligations
and
MBS
exempt
from
U.S.
and
Puerto
Rico
income
taxes
and
by doing
business
through
an
International
Banking Entity
(“IBE”) unit
of the Bank,
and through
the Bank’s
subsidiary,
FirstBank Overseas Corporation,
whose interest income
and gains on sales is
exempt from Puerto
Rico income taxation. The
IBE unit and FirstBank Overseas
Corporation were created under
the
International
Banking
Entity
Act
of
Puerto
Rico,
which provides
for
total
Puerto
Rico
tax
exemption
on net
income derived
by
IBEs operating in Puerto Rico on the specific activities
identified in the IBE Act. An IBE that operates
as a unit of a bank pays income
taxes at the corporate standard rates to the extent that the IBE’s
net income exceeds 20% of the bank’s
total net taxable income.
The CARES
Act of
2020 includes
several provisions
to stimulate
the U.S.
economy in
the midst
of the
COVID-19 pandemic.
The
CARES Act
of 2020
includes tax
provisions that
temporarily modified
the taxable
income limitations
for NOL
usage to
offset future
taxable income, NOL
carryback provisions and other
related income and
non-income based tax
laws. Due to the
fact that the COVID-
pandemic
is still
ongoing,
the
federal
government
extended
some
of
the
benefits
and
continued
the
economic
stimulus
from
the
CARES Act of 2020. The Corporation
has evaluated such provisions and determined
that the impact of the CARES Act on
the income
tax provision and deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021 was not significant.
For
the
year
ended
December
31,
2021,
the
Corporation
recorded
an
income
tax
expense
of
$146.8
million
compared
to
$14.1
million
for
2020.
The variances
were
primarily
related
to higher
pre-tax
income driven
by credit
losses reserve
releases in
the
year
ended
December
31,
2021,
compared
to
significant
charges
to
the
provision
recorded
during
2020,
and
a
higher
level
of
taxable
income. The
Corporation’s
effective tax
rate for
2021, excluding
entities from
which a
tax benefit
cannot be
recognized and
discrete
items,
increased
to
33.9%,
compared
to
17%
for
2020.
The
income
tax
expense
reported
in
was
net
of
the
effect
of
an
$8.0
million partial
reversal of the
Corporation’s
deferred tax
asset valuation
allowance recorded after
consideration of
significant positive
evidence on the utilization of NOLs due to the acquisition of BSPR.
Total
deferred
tax
assets
of
FirstBank,
the
banking
subsidiary,
amounted
to
$208.4
million
as
of
December
31,
2021,
net
of
a
valuation
allowance
of
$69.7 million,
compared
to
total deferred
tax asset
of
$329.1
million,
net
of
a
valuation
allowance
of
$59.9
million, as
of December
31, 2020.
The decrease
in deferred
tax assets
was mainly
driven by
the aforementioned
credit losses reserve
releases
and
the
usage
of
net
operating
losses.
The
increase
in
the
valuation
allowance
was
primarily
related
to
the
change
in
the
market
value
of
available-for-sale
securities.
The
Corporation
maintains
a
full
valuation
allowance
for
its
deferred
tax
assets
associated
with
capital
losses
carry
forward.
Therefore,
changes
in
the
unrealized
losses
of
available-for-sale
securities
result
in
a
change in the deferred tax asset and an equal change in the valuation allowance
without having an effect on earnings.
After completion
of the deferred
tax asset
valuation allowance
analysis for
the fourth
quarter of
2021 management
concluded that,
as of
December 31,
2021, it
is more
likely than
not that
FirstBank, will
generate sufficient
taxable income
to realize
$66.3 million
of
its deferred tax assets related to NOLs within the applicable carry-forward
periods.
The
positive evidence
considered
by management
in arriving
at its
conclusion
includes factors
such as:
(i) FirstBank’s
three-year
cumulative
income
position;
(ii)
sustained
periods
of
profitability;
(iii)
management’s
proven
ability
to
forecast
future
income
accurately
and
execute
tax
strategies;
(iv)
forecasts
of
future
profitability
under
several
potential
scenarios
that
support
the
partial
utilization of
NOLs prior
to their
expiration from
2022 through
2024; (v)
and the
utilization of
NOLs over
the past
three-years.
The
negative
evidence
considered
by
management
includes
uncertainties
around
the
state
of
the
Puerto
Rico
economy,
including
considerations on
the impact of
the pandemic recovery
funds together with
the ultimate sustainability
of the latest
fiscal plan certified
by the PROMESA oversight board.
Management’s
estimate
of
future
taxable
income
is
based
on
internal
projections
that
consider
historical
performance,
multiple
internal scenarios and
assumptions, as well as
external data that
management believes is
reasonable. If events
are identified that affect
the Corporation’s
ability to utilize
its deferred tax
assets, the analysis
will be updated
to determine if
any adjustments to
the valuation
allowance
are
required.
If
actual
results
differ
significantly
from
the
current
estimates
of
future
taxable
income,
even
if
caused
by
adverse
macro-economic
conditions,
the
remaining
valuation
allowance
may
need
to
be
increased.
Such
an
increase
could
have
a
material
adverse
effect
on
the
Corporation’s
financial
condition
and
results
of
operations.
Conversely,
a
higher
than
projected
proportion
of
taxable
income to
exempt
income
could
lead to
a
higher
usage
of
available NOLs
and
a
lower
amount of
disallowed
NOLs from projected
levels of tax-exempt income,
per the 2011
PR code, which in
turn could result in
further releases to the
deferred
tax valuation
allowance; any
such decreases
could have
a material positive
effect on
the Corporation’s
financial condition
and results
of operations.
As of December
31, 2021, approxima
tely $177.9 million
of the deferred
tax assets of
the Corporation
are attributable to
temporary
differences or tax credit
carryforwards that have no expiration date,
compared to $210.7 million in the
year ended December 31, 2020.
The
valuation
allowance
attributable
to
FirstBank’s
deferred
tax
assets
of
$69.7
million
as
of
December
31,
is
related
to
the
estimated
NOL
disallowance
attributable
to
projected
levels
of
tax-exempt
income,
NOLs
attributable
to
the
Virgin
Islands
jurisdiction,
and
capital
losses. The
remaining
balance
of $37.6
million
of
the
Corporation’s
deferred
tax
asset valuation
allowance
non-attributable to FirstBank is mainly related to NOLs and capital
losses at the holding company level. The Corporation will continue
to
provide
a
valuation
allowance
against
its
deferred
tax
assets
in
each
applicable
tax
jurisdiction
until
the
need
for
a
valuation
allowance is eliminated.
The need for
a valuation allowance
is eliminated when
the Corporation determines
that it is
more likely than
not the
deferred tax
assets will
be realized.
The ability
to recognize
the remaining
deferred tax
assets that
continue to
be subject
to a
valuation allowance
will be evaluated
on a quarterly
basis to determine
if there are
any significant events
that would affect
the ability
to utilize these deferred tax assets.
The Corporation
has U.S.
and USVI
sourced NOL
carryforwards. Section
382 of
the U.S.
Internal Revenue
Code (“Section
382”)
limits the ability
to utilize U.S. and
USVI NOLs for income
tax purposes in
such jurisdictions following
an event that is considered
to
be an “ownership change.”
Generally, an
“ownership change” occurs when
certain shareholders increase their
aggregate ownership by
more
than
percentage
points
over
their
lowest
ownership
percentage
over
a
three-year
testing
period.
Upon
the
occurrence
of
a
Section 382
ownership change,
the use
of NOLs
attributable to
the period
prior to
the ownership
change is
subject to
limitations and
only a portion of the U.S. and USVI NOLs may be used by the Corporation
to offset its annual U.S. and USVI taxable income, if any.
In
2017,
the
Corporation
completed
a
formal
ownership
change
analysis
within
the
meaning
of
Section
covering
a
comprehensive
period
and
concluded
that
an
ownership
change
had
occurred
during
such
period.
The
Section
limitation
has
resulted
in
higher
U.S.
and
USVI
income
tax
liabilities
than
we
would
have
incurred
in
the
absence
of
such
limitation.
The
Corporation has mitigated to an extent the adverse effects
associated with the Section 382 limitation as any such tax paid in
the U.S. or
USVI is
creditable against
Puerto Rico
tax liabilities
or taken
as a
deduction against
taxable income.
However,
our ability
to reduce
our
Puerto
Rico
tax
liability
through
such
a
credit
or
deduction
depends
on
our
tax
profile
at
each
annual
taxable
period,
which
is
dependent
on
various
factors.
For
2021,
and
2019,
the
Corporation
incurred
an
income
tax
expense
of
approximately
$6.8
million, $4.9 million,
and $4.5 million,
respectively,
related to its U.S.
operations.
The limitation did not
impact the USVI operations
in 2021, 2020, and 2019.
The Corporation
accounts for uncertain
tax positions under
the provisions
of ASC Topic
740. The Corporation’s
policy is to
report
interest and penalties
related to unrecognized
tax benefits in income
tax expense. As
of December 31,
2021, the Corporation
had $0.2
million of
accrued interest
and penalties
related to
uncertain tax
positions in
the amount
of $1.0
million that
it acquired
from BSPR,
which,
if recognized,
would decrease
the
effective
income tax
rate in
future
periods. The
amount
of
unrecognized
tax benefits
may
increase
or
decrease
in
the
future
for
various
reasons,
including
adding
amounts
for
current
tax
year
positions,
expiration
of
open
income
tax returns
due
to the
statute of
limitations,
changes
in management’s
judgment about
the level
of uncertainty,
the status
of
examinations,
litigation, and
legislative activity,
and the
addition or
elimination of
uncertain tax
positions. The
statute of
limitations
under the 2011
PR code is four years;
the statute of limitations for
U.S. and USVI income tax
purposes is three years after
a tax return
is due or filed, whichever
is later. The
completion of an audit by the
taxing authorities or the expiration
of the statute of limitations for
a
given
audit
period
could
result
in
an
adjustment
to
the
Corporation’s
liability
for
income
taxes.
Any
such
adjustment
could
be
material to the results of
operations for any given quarterly
or annual period based, in
part, upon the results of
operations for the given
period.
For U.S.
and USVI
income tax
purposes,
all tax
years subsequent
to 2017
remain open
to examination.
For Puerto
Rico tax
purposes, all tax years subsequent to 2016 remain open to examination.
OPERATING SEGMENTS
Based
upon
the
Corporation’s
organizational
structure
and
the
information
provided
to
the
Chief
Executive
Officer
of
the
Corporation,
the operating
segments are
based primarily
on the
Corporation’s
lines of
business for
its operations
in Puerto
Rico, the
Corporation’s
principal
market,
and
by
geographic
areas
for
its
operations
outside
of
Puerto
Rico.
As
of
December
31,
2021,
the
Corporation
had
six
reportable
segments:
Commercial
and
Corporate
Banking;
Consumer
(Retail)
Banking;
Mortgage
Banking;
Treasury
and Investments;
United States operations;
and Virgin
Islands operations.
Management determined
the reportable segments
based
on
the
internal
structure
used
to
evaluate
performance
and
to
assess
where
to
allocate
resources.
Other
factors,
such
as
the
Corporation’s
organizational
chart,
nature
of
the
products,
distribution
channels,
and
the
economic
characteristics
of
the
products,
were also considered in the determination of the
reportable segments. For additional information regarding First BanCorp.’s
reportable
segments, please
refer to
Note 36
- Segment
Information, to
the audited
consolidated financial
statements included
in Item
8 of
this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same
as those described in Note 1 - Nature of
Business and Summary of Significant
Accounting
Policies,
to
the
audited
consolidated
financial
statements
included
in
Item
of
this Annual
Report
on
Form
10-K.
The
Corporation
evaluates
the
performance
of
the
segments
based
on
net
interest
income,
the
provision
for
credit
losses,
non-interest
income, and direct non-interest expenses.
The segments are also evaluated based on
the average volume of their interest-earning
assets
less
the
ACL.
For
the
years
ended
December
31,
and
2020,
other
operating
expenses
not
allocated
to
a
particular
segment
amounted
to $192.2
million and
$165.4 million,
respectively.
Expenses pertaining
to corporate
administrative
functions that
support
the operating
segment, but
are not
specifically attributable
to or
managed by
any segment,
are not
included in
the reported
financial
results of the
operating segments. The
unallocated corporate
expenses include certain
general and administrative
expenses and related
depreciation and amortization expenses.
The
Treasury
and
Investments
segment
lends
funds
to
the
Consumer
(Retail)
Banking,
Mortgage
Banking,
Commercial
and
Corporate
Banking
and United
States operations
segments
to finance
their lending
activities and
borrows
from those
segments. The
Consumer
(Retail)
Banking
segment
also
lends
funds
to
other
segments.
The
Corporation
allocates
the
interest
rates
charged
or
credited by the
Treasury and
Investment and the
Consumer (Retail) Banking
segments based on
market rates. The
difference between
the
allocated
interest
income
or
expense
and
the
Corporation’s
actual
net
interest
income
from
centralized
management
of
funding
costs is reported in the Treasury and Investments
segment.
Commercial and Corporate Banking
The
Commercial
and
Corporate
Banking
segment
consists
of
the
Corporation’s
lending
and
other
services
for
large
customers
represented
by specialized
and middle
-market clients
and
the public
sector.
FirstBank has
developed
expertise in
a wide
variety
of
industries.
The
Commercial
and
Corporate
Banking
segment
offers
commercial
loans,
including
commercial
real
estate
and
construction
loans, as
well as
other products,
such as
cash management
and business
management
services. A
substantial portion
of
the commercial
and corporate
banking portfolio
is secured
by the
underlying real
estate collateral
and the
personal guarantees
of the
borrowers. Since
commercial loans
involve greater
credit risk
than a
typical residential
mortgage loan
because they
are larger
in size
and
more
risk
is
concentrated
in
a
single
borrower,
the
Corporation
has
and
maintains
a
credit
risk
management
infrastructure
designed
to mitigate
potential losses
associated with
commercial lending,
including underwriting
and loan
review functions,
sales of
loan participations, and continuous monitoring of concentrations within
portfolios.
The highlights
of the
Commercial and
Corporate Banking
segment’s
financial results
for the
years ended
December 31,
and
2020 include the following:
●
Segment
income
before
taxes
for
the
year
ended
December
31,
increased
to
$239.3
million,
compared
to
$45.0
million for 2020, for the reasons discussed below.
●
Net
interest
income
for
the year
ended
December
31,
was $191.9
million,
compared
to $135.6
million
for 2020.
The increase in net interest
income was primarily
attributable to the increase
in the average balance
of the loan portfolio,
driven by
the effect
of commercial
loans acquired
in conjunction
with the
BSPR acquisition,
and accelerated
PPP loans
fees recognized upon receipt of forgiveness payments from
the SBA in 2021.
●
For 2021, the provision for
credit losses was a net benefit
of $67.5 million net benefit,
compared to a net charge
of $74.6
million
for
2020.
The
net
benefit
recorded
in
reflects
continued
improvements
in
the
long-term
outlook
of
forecasted macroeconomic
variables, primarily
in the commercial
real estate price
index, and
the overall
decrease in the
size
of
this
portfolio
in
the
Puerto
Rico
region.
The
charge
to
the
provision
in
included
a
$13.8
million
charge
related to the
initial reserves required
for non-PCD commercial loans
acquired in conjunction
with the BSPR acquisition
and higher
reserve builds
reflecting the
effect of
the COVID-19
pandemic on
forecasted macroeconomic
variables used
in the Corporation’s CECL model.
●
Total
non-interest income
for the
year ended
December 31,
2021 amounted
to $16.0
million compared
to $12.6
million
for 2020.
The increase was mainly related to a $4.2 million increase in service charges
on deposits, primarily due to cash
management
fee income
from corporate
customers, partially
offset
by the
effect
in 2020
of fee
income of
$0.5 million
recorded in
connection with
participation interests
sold on Main
Street loans
originated in
the Puerto
Rico region,
and a
benefit of approxim
ately $0.8 million
related to the
portion of the
business interruption
insurance recoveries allocated
to
this operating segment.
●
Direct non-interest
expenses for
the year
ended December
31, 2021
were $36.2
million, compared
to $28.6
million for
2020. The increase primarily
reflects the effect
of incremental expenses
related to the acquired
commercial operations of
BSPR, primarily employees’ compensation and professional service fees related
to this operating segment.
Consumer (Retail) Banking
The
Consumer
(Retail)
Banking
segment
consists
of
the
Corporation’s
consumer
lending
and
deposit-taking
activities
conducted
mainly
through
FirstBank’s
branch
network
and
loan
centers
in
Puerto
Rico.
Loans
to
consumers
include
auto,
boat,
and
personal
loans, credit
card loans,
and lines
of credit.
Deposit products
include interest-bearing
and non-interest
bearing checking
and savings
accounts, individual
retirement accounts
(“IRAs”), and
retail CDs.
Retail deposits
gathered through
each branch
of FirstBank’s
retail
network serve as one of the funding sources for the lending and investment
activities.
Consumer lending
historically has
been mainly
driven by
auto loan
originations. The
Corporation follows
a strategy
of seeking
to
provide outstanding service to selected auto dealers that provide the
channel for the bulk of the Corporation’s
auto loan originations.
Personal
loans, credit
cards,
and,
to a
lesser extent,
boat
loans also
contribute
to interest
income
generated
on consumer
lending.
Management
plans
to
continue
to
be
active
in
the
consumer
loan
market,
applying
the
Corporation’s
strict
underwriting
standards.
Other activities included in this segment are finance leases and insurance
activities in Puerto Rico.
The
highlights
of
the
Consumer
(Retail)
Banking
segment’s
financial
results
for
the
years
ended
December
31,
and
include the following:
●
Segment
income
before
taxes
for
the
year
ended
December
31,
increased
to
$165.8
million,
compared
to
$86.4
million for 2020, for the reasons discussed below.
●
Net
interest
income
for
the year
ended
December
31,
was $281.7
million,
compared
to $220.7
million
for 2020.
The
increase
was
mainly
due
to
an
increase
in
the
average
volume
of
consumer
loans
in
Puerto
Rico
that
reflects
the
effect of
both consumer
loans acquired
in conjunction
with the
BSPR acquisition
and organic
growth, as
well as
higher
income
from
funds
loaned
to
other
business
segments
due
to
the
growth
in
non-brokered
deposits,
mainly
demand
deposits, that, among other things, served as a funding source for lending activities
of other operating segments.
●
The
provision
for
credit
losses
for
the
year
ended
December
31,
decreased
by
$33.8
million
to
$20.3
million,
compared to
$54.1 million
for the year
ended
December 31,
2020. The
decrease reflects
the effect
of significant
reserve
builds in
2020 due
to the
deterioration of
the macroeconomic
outlook as
a result
of the
COVID-19 pandemic
primarily
reflected
in
auto
loans,
finance
leases,
and
credit
card
loans,
as
well
as
the
effect
in
of
the
$10.1
million
Day 1
provision recorded for non-PCD consumer loans acquired in conjunction
with the BSPR acquisition.
●
Non-interest income for the
year ended December 31, 2021
was $69.8 million, compared
to $51.0 million for 2020.
The
increase was
primarily
related to
a $6.4
million increase
in service
charges
on deposits
primarily
related to
the income
generated
by
the
acquired
BSPR
operations,
as
well
as
an
increase
in
the
monthly
service
fee
charged
on
certain
checking
and
savings
products.
In
addition,
transaction
fee
income
from
credit
and
debit
cards
and
merchant-related
activities
increased
by
$9.9
million,
and
insurance
commission
income
in
Puerto
Rico
increased
by
$2.4
million,
primarily
related
to an
increased customer
activity as
compared
to year
2020 that
was adversely
affected
by pandemic
stay-at-home orders
and related interruptions.
These variances were
partially offset
by the effect
in 2020 of
a benefit of
approximately
$2.4
million
related
to
the
portion
of
the
business
interruption
insurance
recoveries
allocated
to
this
operating segment.
●
Direct non-interest expenses for
the year ended December
31, 2021 were $165.4 million,
compared to $131.1 million
for
2020.
The
increase
was
primarily
due
to
incremental
expenses
related
to
the
acquired
operations
of
BSPR,
primarily
employees’
compensation,
occupancy
and
equipment,
temporary
technology
processing
costs,
credit
and
debit
cards
processing fees, municipal taxes and core deposit intangible amortization
related to this operating segment.
Mortgage Banking
The
Mortgage
Banking
segment
conducts
its
operations
mainly
through
FirstBank.
The
segment’s
operations
consist
of
the
origination, sale, and
servicing of a variety
of residential mortgage loan
products. Originations are
sourced through different
channels,
such
as
FirstBank
branches
and
purchases
from
mortgage
bankers,
and
in
association
with
new
project
developers.
The
mortgage
banking segment
focuses on
originating
residential real
estate loans,
some of
which conform
to the
Federal Housing
Administration
(the
“FHA”),
the
Veterans
Administration
(the
“
VA
”),
and
U.S.
Department
of
Agriculture
Rural
Development
(“RD”)
standards.
Loans originated that meet
the FHA’s
standards qualify for
the FHA’s
insurance program whereas loans
that meet the standards
of the
VA
or the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development (“RD”) are
guaranteed by their respective federal agencies.
Mortgage
loans that
do not
qualify under
the FHA,
VA,
or RD
programs
are referred
to as
conventional
loans. Conventional
real
estate loans can
be conforming or
non-conforming.
Conforming loans are
residential real estate
loans that meet
the standards for
sale
under
the
U.S.
Federal
National
Mortgage
Association
(“FNMA”)
and
the
U.S.
Federal
Home
Loan
Mortgage
Corporation
(“FHLMC”) programs.
Loans that
do not
meet FNMA
or FHLMC
standards are
referred to
as non-conforming
residential real
estate
loans. The
Corporation’s
strategy is
to penetrate
markets by
providing customers
with a
variety of
high quality
mortgage products
to
serve
their
financial
needs
through
a
faster
and
simpler
process
and
at
competitive
prices.
The
Mortgage
Banking
segment
also
acquires and
sells mortgages
in the
secondary markets.
Residential real
estate conforming
loans are
sold to
investors like
FNMA and
FHLMC.
The Corporation has commitment authority to issue GNMA MBS.
The highlights
of the
Mortgage Banking
segment’s
financial results
for the
years ended
December 31,
2021 and
2020 include
the
following:
●
Segment
income
before
taxes
for
the
year
ended
December
31,
increased
to
$115.8
million,
compared
to
$42.5
million for 2020, for the reasons discussed below.
●
Net interest income for
the year ended December
31, 2021 was $104.6
million, compared to
$76.0 million for 2020.
The
increase in
net interest
income was
mainly due
to both
the increase
in the
average balance
of residential
mortgage loans
in the Puerto
Rico region driven
by residential mortgage
loans acquired in
conjunction with the
BSPR acquisition, and
a
decrease in the
cost of funds borrowed
from other segments
resulting from overall
lower short-term market
interest rates
as compared to 2020 overall levels.
●
The provision
for credit losses
for 2021
was a net
benefit of $16.0
million, compared
to an expense
of $22.5 million
for
2020.
The
net
benefit
recorded
in
reflects
the
effect
of
reserve
releases
associated
with
both
continued
improvements
in
the
long-term
outlook
of
macroeconomic
variables,
such
as
regional
unemployment
rates
and
Home
Price
Index,
and
the
overall
portfolio
decrease.
The
significant
reserve
builds
in
the
prior
year
were
due
to
the
deterioration of the
macroeconomic outlook
as a result
of the COVID-19
pandemic and a
$13.6 million Day
1 provision
recorded for non-PCD residential mortgage loans acquired in conjunction
with the BSPR acquisition.
●
Non-interest income for the
year ended December 31, 2021
was $24.3 million, compared
to $22.1 million for 2020.
The
increase
was mainly
due
to a
$1.5
million
increase
in service
fee income
and
a $1.9
million increase
in realized
gains
from sales of
residential mortgage
loans.
These variances were
partially offset
by the effect
in 2020 of
a benefit of
$0.7
million related to the portion of the business interruption insurance
recoveries allocated to this operating segment.
●
Direct non-interest
expenses for
the year
ended December
31, 2021
were $29.1
million, compared
to $33.1
million for
2020.
The decrease
was
mainly
related
to a
$5.4
million decrease
in losses
on
OREO operations,
primarily
related
to
higher
gains realized
on
the sale
of residential
OREO properties,
partially
offset
by the
effect
of incremental
expenses
related to the acquired operations of BSPR, primarily employees’ compensation
related to this operating segment.
Treasury and
Investments
The
Treasury
and
Investments
segment
is
responsible
for
the
Corporation’s
treasury
and
investment
management
functions.
The
treasury function, which
includes funding and
liquidity management, lends
funds to the
Commercial and Corporate
Banking segment,
the Mortgage
Banking segment,
the Consumer
(Retail) Banking
segment,
and the
United States
operations
segment
to finance
their
respective lending
activities and
borrows from
those segments.
The Treasury
function also
obtains funds
through brokered
deposits,
advances from the FHLB, and repurchase agreements involving investment
securities, among other possible funding sources.
The investment function is intended to implement a leverage strategy
for the purposes of liquidity management, interest rate risk
management and earnings enhancement.
The interest rates charged or credited by Treasury
and Investments are based on market rates.
The
highlights
of
the
Treasury
and
Investments
segment’s
financial
results
for
the
years
ended
December
31,
and
include the following:
●
Segment
income
before
taxes
for
the
year
ended
December
31,
decreased
to
$55.6
million,
compared
to
$95.4
million for 2020, for the reasons discussed below.
●
Net interest
income for
the year ended
December 31,
2021 was $59.
million, compared
to net
interest income
of $87.9
million for 2020.
The decrease was mainly related
to lower income from funds
loaned to other business segments
due to
a higher proportion
of the lending
activities of other
operating segments being
funded by the
growth in demand
deposits
of the
Consumer
(Retail) Banking
operating
segment,
partially offset
by the
overall
increase in
the average
balance
of
U.S. agencies MBS and debt securities.
●
Non-interest income
for the
year ended
December 31,
2021 amounted
to $0.2
million, compared
to non-interest
income
of
$13.7
million
for
2020.
The
variance
primarily
reflects
the
effect
of
the
$13.2
million
gain
realized
on
sales
of
available-for-sale investment securities in 2020.
●
Direct non-interest expenses
for 2021 were $4.1
million, compared to $3.4
million for 2020.
The increase was primarily
reflected in employees’ compensation expense and professional service
fees.
United States Operations
The
United
States Operations
segment
consists of
all banking
activities conducted
by FirstBank
on
the U.S.
mainland.
FirstBank
provides
a
wide
range
of
banking
services
to
individual
and
corporate
customers
primarily
in
southern
Florida
through
banking
branches.
The United
States Operations
segment
offers
an array
of both
consumer and
commercial
banking products,
and
services.
Consumer banking
products include
checking, savings
and money
market accounts,
retail CDs,
internet banking
services, residential
mortgages, and
home equity
loans and
lines of
credit. Retail
deposits, as
well as
FHLB advances
and brokered
CDs, allocated
to this
operation serve as funding sources for its lending activities.
The commercial banking services include
checking, savings and money market
accounts, retail CDs, internet banking services,
cash
management services, remote data capture,
and automated clearing house, or ACH, transactions.
Loan products include the traditional
commercial and industrial (“C&I”) and commercial real estate products,
such as lines of credit, term loans, and construction loans.
The highlights of the
United States operations segment’s
financial results for the years
ended December 31, 2021 and
2020, include
the following:
●
Segment
income
before
taxes
for
the
year
ended
December
31,
increased
to
$37.0
million,
compared
to
$12.3
million for 2020, for the reasons discussed below.
●
Net interest income
for the year
ended December 31,
2021 was $66.0
million, compared to
$54.0 million for
2020.
The
increase was mainly due
to a decrease in interest
expense associated with lower
average volumes of FHLB
advances and
brokered
CDs
allocated
to
this
operating
segment,
as
well
as
accelerated
PPP
loan
fees
recognized
upon
receipt
of
forgiveness
payments
from
SBA
in
2021.
These
variances
more
than
offset
the
effect
of
the
downward
repricing
of
variable-rate commercial and construction loans due to lower prevailing market
interest rates during 2021.
●
For 2021, the
provision for
credit losses was
a net benefit
of $1.0 million,
compared to a
net charge
of $12.6 million
for
2020.
The
net
benefit
recorded
in
2021,
reflects
continued
improvements
in
the
long-term
outlook
of
forecasted
macroeconomic variables,
primarily in the
commercial real estate
price index,
and the overall
decrease in the
size of the
residential portfolio
in this
operating segment.
The significant
reserves builds
in the
prior year
reflects the
effect of
the
COVID-19 pandemic on forecasted macroeconomic variables used in
the Corporation’s CECL model.
●
Total non
-interest income for the year
ended December 31, 2021
amounted to $4.0 million,
compared to $4.6 million
for
2020.
The decrease was primarily related to
the effect in 2020 of fee
income of $1.0 million recorded in connection
with
the
sale
of
the
95%
participation
interests
in
Main
Street
loans
originated
in
2020,
partially
offset
by
a
$0.3
million
increase in service fee income.
●
Direct non-interest
expenses for
the year
ended December
31, 2021
were $33.9
million, compared
to $33.8
million for
2020.
The
increase
was
mainly
due
to
a
decrease
in
deferred
loan
origination
costs,
including
the
effect
of
a
lower
volume of SBA
PPP loans originated
in 2021, partially
offset by a
decrease in professional
service fees and
in the FDIC
insurance premium expense allocated to this segment.
Virgin
Islands Operations
The Virgin
Islands Operations
segment consists
of all
banking activities
conducted by
FirstBank in
the USVI
and BVI,
including
consumer
and commercial
banking
services,
with
a total
of eight
banking
branches
currently
serving
the islands
in
the USVI
of St.
Thomas,
St.
Croix,
and
St.
John,
and
the
island
of
Tortola
in
the
BVI.
The
Virgin
Islands
Operations
segment
is
driven
by
its
consumer, commercial lending, and deposit
-taking activities.
Loans
to
consumers
include
auto
and
boat
loans,
lines
of
credit,
and
personal
and
residential
mortgage
loans.
Deposit
products
include
interest-bearing
and
non-interest-bearing
checking
and
savings
accounts,
IRAs,
and
retail
CDs.
Retail
deposits
gathered
through each branch serve as the funding sources for its own lending activities.
The
highlights
of
the
Virgin
Islands
operations’
financial
results
for
the
years
ended
December
31,
and
include
the
following:
●
Segment income before
taxes for the year
ended December 31, 2021
increased to $6.5 million,
compared to $0.2 million
for 2020, for the reasons discussed below.
●
Net interest income
for the year
ended December 31,
2021 was $26.4
million, compared to
$26.1 million for
2020.
The
increase in
net interest
income was
primarily related
to the decrease
in the
interest rate
paid on
interest-bearing deposits
attributed to lower market
interest rates, and accelerated
PPP loan fees recognized
upon receipt of forgiveness
payments
from SBA
in 2021,
partially offset
by a
decrease in
the average
balance of
residential mortgage
loans in
this operating
segment.
●
The
Corporation
recognized
a
provision
for
credit
losses
net
benefit
of
$1.3
million
for
the
year
ended
December
31,
2021, compared to
a provision expense of
$4.4 million for 2020.
The variance was
primarily related to reserve
builds in
in
connection
with
the
effect
of
the
COVID-19
pandemic
on
macroeconomic
variables
employed
in
the
Corporation’s CECL model,
primarily for the commercial portfolios.
●
Non-interest
income for
the year
ended December
31, 2021
was $6.9
million, compared
to $7.3
million for
2020.
The
decrease was mainly
related to the
effect in 2020
of a $1.0
million benefit recorded
in connection with
hurricane-related
insurance
recoveries,
primarily
due
to
the
portion
of
the
business
interruption
insurance
recoveries
allocated
to
this
operating
segment.
This
variance
was
partially
offset
by
a
$0.4
million
increase
in
fee-based
income
from
credit
and
debit
cards
as
well
as
merchant-related
activities,
and
a
$0.1
million
increase
in
service
charges
on
deposits,
both
affected in 2020 by disruptions in business activities caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic.
●
Direct non
-interest expenses
for
the year
ended December
31,
2021 were
$28.1
million compared
to $28.8
million
for
2020.
The
decrease
was
mainly
due
to
a
reduction
of
$1.1
million
in
net
OREO
losses,
primarily
related
to
higher
realized gains
on sales
of residential
OREO properties,
and a
decrease of
$0.8 million
in employees’
compensation and
benefits.
These variances
were partially
offset by
accelerated depreciation
charges related
to the
closing of
branches in
the Virgin
Islands region and an increase in professional service fees.

_________
(1) Includes, among other things, the ACL on loans and finance leases and debt securities.
(2) Includes, among other things, non-interest-bearing deposits.
The Corporation’s
total average assets
were $20.3
billion for the
year ended December
31, 2021, compared
to $15.2 billion
for the
year
ended
December
31,
2020,
an
increase
of
$5.1
billion.
The
variance
primarily
reflects:
(i)
an
increase
of
$3.8
billion
in
the
average
balance
of
investment
securities
and
interest-bearing
cash
balances,
reflecting
both
increased
purchases
of
investment
securities and
growth in
cash balances supported
by strong deposit
growth during
2021; and (ii)
a $1.3 billion
increase in the
average
balance of total
loans, reflecting the
effect of loans
acquired in conjunction
with the BSPR
acquisition,
the volume of SBA
PPP loans
originated in 2020 and 2021, and organic growth of the Corporation’s
consumer loan portfolio.
The
Corporation’s
total
average
liabilities
were
$18.1
billion
as
of
December
31,
2021,
an
increase
of
$5.1
billion
compared
to
December 31, 2020. The
increase was mainly related to
a $2.7 billion increase in
the average balance of non-brokered
interest-bearing
deposits and
a $2.8 million
increase in the
average balance of
non-interest-bearing deposits,
primarily reflecting
the effect of
deposits
assumed in
conjunction with
the BSPR
acquisition, as
well as
the effect
of government
relief programs
on the
liquidity levels
of our
customers,
including
government
entities.
The
aforementioned
variances
were
partially
offset
by
a
$216.0
million
decrease
in
the
average balance of brokered CDs and a $151.4 million decrease in the average balance
of FHLB advances.
Assets
The
Corporation’s
total assets
were $20.8
billion
as of
December 31,
2021, an
increase of
$2.0 billion
from December
31, 2020.
The
increase
was
primarily
related
to
a
$1.8
billion
increase
in
investment
securities,
mainly
driven
by
purchases
of
U.S.
agencies
MBS and
U.S. agencies
callable and
bullet debentures
and an
increase of
$1.0 billion
in cash
equivalents attributable
to the
liquidity
obtained
from the
growth in
deposits and
loan repayments.
These variances
were partially
offset
by a
decrease of
$731.8 million
in
total loans, as further discussed below.

(1)
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, includes $145.0 million and
$406.0 million, respectively, of SBA
PPP loans.
As of
December 31,
2021, the
Corporation’s
total loan
portfolio, before
the ACL,
amounted to
$11.1
billion, a
decrease of
$731.8
million
when
compared
to
December
31,
2020. The
decrease
consisted
of
reductions
of
$611.6
million
in
the
Puerto
Rico
region,
$75.1
million
in
the
Virgin
Islands
region,
and
$45.1
million
in
the
Florida
region.
On
a
portfolio
basis,
the
decrease
consisted
of
reductions
of
$558.2
million
in
residential
mortgage
loans
and
$452.0
million
in
commercial
and
construction
loans
(including
a
$261.0 million decrease
in the SBA PPP loan
portfolio), partially offset
by an increase of
$278.4 million in consumer
loans, including
a
$377.1
million
increase
in
auto
loans
and
leases.
As
further
discussed
below,
the
decrease
in
commercial
and
construction
loans
reflects, among other
things, the effect
of the payoff
of loans related
to six large
commercial relationships totaling
$211.1 million
and
the
sale
of
four
criticized
commercial
loan
participations
totaling
$43.1
million
in
the Florida
region. The
decline
in
the
residential
mortgage loan
portfolio reflects
the $52.5
million bulk
sale of
nonaccrual loans,
as well
as repayments
and charge
-offs, which
more
than offset the volume of new loan originations kept on the balance
sheet.
As of December 31,
2021, the loans held
for the Corporation’s
investment portfolio was comprised
of commercial and construction
loans
(47%),
residential
real
estate
loans
(27%),
and
consumer
and
finance
leases
(26%).
Of
the
total
gross
loan
portfolio
held
for
investment
of
$11.1
billion
as
of
December
31,
2021,
the
Corporation
had
credit
risk
concentration
of
approximately
79%
in
the
Puerto Rico region,
18% in the
United States region
(mainly in the
state of Florida),
and 3% in
the Virgin
Islands region, as

Residential Real Estate Loans
As of December
31, 2021,
the Corporation’s
total residential mortgage
loan portfolio,
including held
for sale, decreased
by $558.2
million, as compared
to the balance
as of December
31, 2020. The
decline reflects reductions
in all regions
driven by repayments
and
charge-offs,
which
more than
offset
the volume
of new
loan
originations
kept
on the
balance
sheet. In
addition,
the decrease
in
the
residential mortgage loan portfolio
reflects the sale of $52.5 million
of non-performing residential mortgage
loans. Consistent with the
Corporation’s
strategies, the
residential mortgage
loan portfolio
decreased by
$439.5 million
in the
Puerto Rico
region, $93.1
million
in the Florida region, and $25.6
million in the Virgin
Islands region. Approximately 88%
of the $499.7 million in residential
mortgage
loan
originations
in
the
Puerto
Rico
region
during
consisted
of
conforming
loan
originations
and
refinancings.
Conforming
mortgage
loans
are
generally
originated
with
the
intent
to
sell
in
the
secondary
market
to
GNMA
and
U.S.
government-sponsored
agencies.
The majority
of the
Corporation’s
outstanding balance
of residential
mortgage loans
in the
Puerto Rico
and Virgin
Islands regions
consisted of
fixed-rate loans
that traditionally
carry higher yields
than residential
mortgage loans
in the
Florida region.
In the
Florida
region,
approximately
55%
of
the
residential
mortgage
loan
portfolio
consisted
of
hybrid
adjustable-rate
mortgages.
In
accordance
with the Corporation’s
underwriting guidelines,
residential mortgage
loans are primarily
fully-documented loans,
and the Corporation
does not originate negative amortization loans.
Residential
mortgage
loan
originations
for
the
year
ended
December
31,
amounted
to
$623.3
million,
compared
to
$560.0
million
for 2020.
The increase
in residential
mortgage loan
originations
of $63.3
million reflect
increases
of $96.0
million and
$1.6
million,
in
the
Puerto
Rico
and
Virgin
Islands
regions,
respectively,
partially
offset
by
a
decrease
of
$34.3
million
in
the
Florida
region.
The overall increase
reflects
the effect
of a higher
volume of
refinanced loans and
conforming loan
originations driven
by the
effect of lower mortgage
loan interest rates and increased home
purchase activity,
in particular during the first half
of the year,
and the
effect
in
of
disruptions in the
loan underwriting and
closing processes caused by
the almost
two-month lockdown related to
the
COVID-19 pandemic
that was
implemented
in Puerto
Rico on
March 16,
2020.
Commercial and Construction Loans
As of
December 31,
2021, the
Corporation’s
commercial and
construction loan
portfolio decreased
by $452.0
million (including
a
$261.0 million
decrease in
the SBA
PPP loan
portfolio),
to $5.2
billion, as
compared to
the balance
as of
December 31,
2020.
The
decrease
in commercial
and
construction
loans was
primarily
reflected
in the
Puerto
Rico region,
which declined
by $461.0
million
(including a $198.3
million decrease in the
SBA PPP loan portfolio),
as compared to the
balance as of December
31, 2020. Excluding
the $198.3 million
decrease in the SBA
PPP loan portfolio, commercial
and construction loans in
the Puerto Rico region
decreased by
$262.7
million,
driven
by
the
payoff
of
five
large
commercial
mortgage
loan
relationships
totaling
$156.8
million,
a
$22.9
million
decrease
in the
outstanding balance
of loans
extended
to municipalities
and
other government
units, a
$13.8
million decrease
in the
balance of
floor plan
lines of
credit, several
commercial and
industrial term
loans individually
in excess
of $3
million that
were paid
off
during
the
and
totaled
approximately
$26.5
million,
principal
repayments
that
reduced
by
$79.9
million
the
balance
of
revolving lines of credit related to ten commercial and industrial relationships
,
and additional repayments.
In the
Virgin
Islands region,
commercial and
construction loans
decreased by
$50.0 million
(including a
$19.2 million
decrease in
the SBA
PPP loan
portfolio) as
compared to
the balance
as of December
31, 2020.
Excluding the
$19.2 million
decrease in
the SBA
PPP loan portfolio,
commercial and construction
loans in the Virgin
Islands region decreased by
$30.8 million primarily
due to a $6.0
million repayment of a nonaccrual construction loan and the early payoff
of a $23.2 million government loan.
In the
Florida region,
commercial and
construction
loans increased
by $59.0
million (net
of a
$43.5
million
decrease in
the SBA
PPP loan
portfolio).
Excluding the
$43.0
million decrease
in the
SBA PPP
loan
portfolio, commercial
and construction
loans in
the
Florida region increased by $102.5 million, driven by
the origination of several commercial loans individually in excess of $10
million
related
to
thirteen
commercial
and
industrial
relationships
and
totaling
$249.5
million,
partially
offset
by
the
sale
of
four
criticized
commercial loan participations totaling $43.1 million and the early payoff
of a $54.3 million commercial loan.
As mentioned
above, the SBA
reactivated the
PPP in January
2021. The Corporation
originated additional
PPP loans up
to the end
of
the
program
on
May
31,
2021.
As
of
December
31,
2021,
SBA
PPP
loans,
net
of
unearned
fees
of
$7.9
million,
totaled
$145.0
million, compared
to $406.0
million as
of December
31, 2020.
In 2021,
the Corporation
originated $283.6
million in
PPP loans
and
received forgiveness remittances and customer payments
of approximately $543.6 million in the principal balance of PPP loans.
As of
December
31,
2021,
the Corporation
had
$178.4
million
outstanding
in
loans
extended
to
the Puerto
Rico
government,
its
municipalities
and
public
corporations,
compared
to
$201.3
million
as
of
December
31,
2020.
As
of
December
31,
2021,
approximately $100.3 million
consisted of loans
extended to municipalities
in Puerto Rico that
are supported by assigned
property tax
revenues
and
$32.2
million
consisted
of
municipal
special
obligation
bonds.
In
addition
to
loans
extended
to
municipalities,
the
Corporation’s exposure
to the Puerto Rico government
as of December 31, 2021
included $12.5 million in loans granted
to an affiliate
of PREPA
and $33.4 million in loans to an agency of the Puerto Rico central government.
The
Corporation
also
has
credit
exposure
to
USVI
government
entities.
As
of
December
31,
2021,
the
Corporation
had
$39.2
million in
loans to
USVI government
and public
corporations, compared
to $61.8
million as
of December
31, 2020.
All the
amount
outstanding
as
of
December
31,
2021,
is
owed
by
the
public
corporations
of
the
USVI.
As
of
December
31,
2021,
all
loans
were
currently performing and up to date on principal and interest payments.
As
of
December
31,
2021,
the
Corporation’s
total
exposure
to
shared
national
credit
(“SNC”)
loans
(including
unused
commitments)
amounted
to
$918.6
million,
compared
to
$882.9
million
as
of
December
31,
2020.
As
of
December
31,
2021,
approximately
$148.5
million
of
the
SNC
exposure
related
to
the
portfolio
in
Puerto
Rico
region
and
$770.1
million
related
to
the
portfolio in the Florida region.
Commercial
and
construction
loan
originations
(excluding
government
loans)
amounted
to
$3.1
billion
for
the
year
ended
December 31, 2021, compared to $2.8 billion
for 2020. Total commercial
and construction loan originations in 2021 include
SBA PPP
loan originations
of $283.6
million, compared
to $390.2
million in
2020.
Excluding SBA
PPP loans
and the
$184.4 million
of Main
Street
loans
originated
in
2020,
commercial
and
construction
loan
originations
increased
$510.9
million
compared
to
2020.
The
increase consisted of increases
of $184.9 million, $302.6
million, and $23.4 million
in the Puerto Rico, Florida,
and the Virgin
Islands
regions, respectively.
The increase
in 2021
reflects an
increase in
the utilization
of floor
plan and
other commercial
lines of
credit in
the Puerto Rico
region,
as compared to
2020, as well as
a higher volume
of commercial and
industrial loan originations
in the Florida
region. The increase also
reflects
the effect in 2020
of disruptions caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic and related
restrictive measures
on economic activities.
Government
loan
originations
for
amounted
to
$62.8
million,
compared
to
$41.3
million
for
2020.
Government
loan
originations
in
both
years
primarily
consisted
of
the
refinancing
and
renewal
of
certain
facilities
in
both
the
Virgin
Islands
and
the
Puerto
Rico
regions,
as
well
as
the
utilization
of
an
arranged
overdraft

of
credit
of
a
government
entity
in
the
Virgin
Islands
region.

Consumer Loans and Finance Leases
As of December
31, 2021, the
Corporation’s
consumer loan and
finance lease portfolio
increased by $278.4
million to $2.9
billion,
as compared
to the portfolio
balance of
$2.6 billion
as of December
31, 2020.
The increase
primarily reflects
increases in
auto loans,
and finance leases
which increased by
$275.1 million and
$102.0 million, respectively,
partially offset by
reductions in personal
loans
and credit cards loans of $61.8
million and $29.6 million, respectively.
The growth in consumer loans is
mainly reflected in the Puerto
Rico region and was driven by an increased level of loan originations
.
Originations
of
auto
loans
(including
finance
leases)
in
amounted
to
$932.7
million,
compared
to
$614.9
million
for
2020.
Personal
loan
originations
in
2021,
other
than
credit
card
loans,
amounted
to
$172.7
million,
compared
to
$123.8
million
in
2020. Most of
the increase
in consumer
loan originations
in 2021,
when compared
to 2020,
was in
the Puerto
Rico region,
reflecting
the
effect
in
of
quarantines
and
lockdowns
of
non-essential
businesses
in
connection
with
the
COVID-19
pandemic
during
2020. The utilization activity
on the outstanding
credit card portfolio in
amounted to approximately
$422.5 million, compared
to
$328.7 million in 2020.

Investment Activities
As part
of its
liquidity,
revenue
diversification,
and
interest rate
risk
strategies,
First BanCorp.
maintains
an investment
portfolio
that is
classified as
available-for-sale
or held
to maturity.
The Corporation’s
total available-for-sale
investment securities
portfolio as
of December
31, 2021
amounted to $6.5
billion, a $1.8
billion increase
from December
31, 2020. The
increase was mainly
driven by
purchases
of
approximately
$3.4
billion
of
U.S.
agencies
MBS and
U.S.
agencies
callable
and
bullet
debentures,
partially
offset
by
prepayments of
$1.1 billion
of U.S. agencies
MBS, approximately
$267.8 million
of U.S. agencies
bonds that
matured or were
called
prior to maturity
during 2021, and
a $143.1 million decrease
in the fair value
of available-for-sale investment
securities attributable to
changes in
market interest
rates. Long-term
market interest
remain at
low levels
but are
expected to
increase during
2022 and
2023,
which
could
impact
prepayment
speed
and
valuation
of
the
investment
portfolio.
These
risks
are
directly
linked
to
future
period
market interest rate fluctuations.
As
of
December
31,
2021,
approximately
99%
of
the
Corporation’s
available-for-sale
securities
portfolio
was
invested
in
U.S.
government
and
agencies
debentures
and
fixed-rate
GSEs’
MBS
(mainly
GNMA,
FNMA,
and
FHLMC
fixed-rate
securities).
In
addition, as
of December
31, 2021,
the Corporation
held a
bond issued
by the
PRHFA,
classified as
available for
sale, specifically
a
residential pass-through
MBS in
the aggregate
amount of
$3.6 million
(fair value
- $2.9
million). This
residential pass-through
MBS
issued
by
the
PRHFA
is
collateralized
by
certain
second
mortgages
originated
under
a
program
launched
by
the
Puerto
Rico
government
in
and
had
an
unrealized
loss
of
$0.7
million
as
of
December
31,
2021,
of
which
$0.3
million
is
due
to
credit
deterioration
and
was charged
against
earnings through
an ACL
during
2020.
Due to
deterioration
in the
delinquency
status of
the
underlying second mortgage loans of this MBS issued by the PRHFA,
the Corporation classified the investment in nonaccrual status in
the second quarter of 2021.
As of December
31, 2021,
the Corporation’s
held-to-maturity investment
securities portfolio,
before the
ACL, amounted
to $178.1
million, compared to $189.5 million
as of December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2021, the
ACL for held-to-maturity debt
securities
was $8.6
million, down
$0.2 million
from $8.8
million as of
December 31,
2020. Held-to-maturity
investment securities
consisted of
financing
arrangements
with
Puerto
Rico
municipalities
issued
in
bond
form,
which
the
Corporation
accounts
for
as securities,
but
which were underwritten as loans with
features that are typically found in commercial
loans. These obligations typically are
not issued
in
bearer
form,
are
not
registered
with
the
SEC,
and
are
not
rated
by
external
credit
agencies.
These
bonds
have
seniority
to
the
payment
of
operating
costs
and
expenses
of
the
municipality
and,
in
most
cases,
are
supported
by
assigned
property
tax
revenues.
Approximately
73% of
the Corporation’s
municipality
bonds consisted
of obligations
issued by
four of
the largest
municipalities
in
Puerto Rico.
The municipalities are
required by law
to levy special
property taxes
in such amounts
as are required
for the payment
of
all of their
respective general obligation
bonds and loans.
Given the uncertainties
as to the effects
that the fiscal
position of the
Puerto
Rico central government,
the COVID-19 pandemic,
and the measures taken,
or to be taken,
by other government entities
may have on
municipalities, the Corporation cannot be certain whether
future charges to the ACL on these securities will be required.

Net
interest
income
of
future
periods
could
be
affected
by
prepayments
of
MBS.
Any
acceleration
in
the
prepayments
of
MBS
would lower yields
on these securities,
since the amortization
of premiums paid
upon acquisition of
these securities would
accelerate.
Conversely,
acceleration
of
the
prepayments
of
MBS
would
increase
yields
on
securities
purchased
at
a
discount,
since
the
amortization of
the discount
would accelerate.
These risks
are directly
linked to
future period
market interest
rate fluctuations.
Also,
net

RISK MANAGEMENT
General
Risks
are
inherent
in
virtually
all
aspects
of
the
Corporation’s
business
activities
and
operations.
Consequently,
effective
risk
management
is
fundamental
to
the
success
of
the
Corporation.
The
primary
goals
of
risk
management
are
to
ensure
that
the
Corporation’s
risk-taking activities are
consistent with the
Corporation’s
objectives and risk
tolerance, and that
there is an appropriate
balance between risk and reward in order to maximize stockholder value.
The
Corporation
has
in
place
a
risk
management
framework
to
monitor,
evaluate
and
manage
the
principal
risks
assumed
in
conducting its activities. First BanCorp.’s
business is subject to 11 broad categories
of risks: (i) liquidity risk; (ii) interest rate risk; (iii)
market risk; (iv) credit risk; (v) operational risk;
(vi) legal and regulatory risk; (vii) reputational risk; (viii)
model risk; (ix) capital risk;
(x) strategic
risk; and
(xi) information
technology risk.
First BanCorp.
has adopted
policies and
procedures
designed to
identify and
manage the risks to which the Corporation is exposed.
Risk Definition
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from the possibility that the
Corporation will not have sufficient cash to meet
its short-term liquidity demands, such as from deposit redemptions or loan
commitments. See Liquidity Risk and Capital Adequacy
below for further details.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk arising from adverse movements in interest rates. See
Interest Rate Risk Management
below for further
details.
Market Risk
Market
risk
is
the
risk
arising
from
adverse
movements
in
market
rates
or
prices,
such
as
interest
rates
or
equity
prices.
The
Corporation
evaluates
market
risk
together
with
interest
rate
risk.
Both
changes
in
market
values
and
changes
in
interest
rates
are
evaluated and forecasted.
See
Interest Rate Risk Management
below for further details.
Credit Risk
Credit risk
is the
risk arising
from a
borrower’s or
a counterparty’s
failure to
meet the
terms of
a contract
with the
Corporation or
otherwise to perform as agreed. See
Credit Risk Management
below for further details.
Operational Risk
Operational
risk
is
the
risk
arising
from
problems
with
the
delivery
of
services
or
products.
This
risk
is
a
function
of
internal
controls,
information
systems,
employees
and
operating
processes.
It
also
includes
risks
associated
with
the
Corporation’s
preparedness
for
the
occurrence
of
an
unforeseen
event.
This
risk
is
inherent
across
all
functions,
products,
and
services
of
the
Corporation. See
Operational Risk
below for further details.
Legal and Regulatory Risk
Legal
and
regulatory
risk is
the risk
arising
from
the Corporation’s
failure
to comply
with laws
or
regulations
that can
adversely
affect the Corporation’s
reputation and/or increase its exposure to litigation or penalties.
Reputational Risk
Reputational
risk
is
the
risk
arising
from
any
adverse
effect
on
the
Corporation’s
market
value,
capital,
or
earnings
arising
from
negative public opinion,
whether true or not.
This risk affects the
Corporation’s
ability to establish new
relationships or services,
or to
continue servicing existing relationships.
Model Risk
Model risk
is the potential
for adverse
consequences from
decisions based
upon incorrect
or misused
model outputs
and reports
or
based upon
an incomplete or
inaccurate model.
The use of
models exposes the
Corporation to some
level of model
risk. Model errors
can
contribute
to
incorrect
valuations
and
lead
to
operational
errors,
inappropriate
business
decisions,
or
incorrect
financial
entries.
The Corporation seeks to reduce model risk through rigorous model identification
and validation.
Capital Risk
Capital risk
is the
risk that
the Corporation
may lose
value on
its capital
or have
an inadequate
capital plan,
which would
result in
insufficient capital
resources to meet
minimum regulatory
requirements (the Corporation’s
authority to operate
as a bank is dependent
upon the maintenance of adequate capital resources), support its credit rating,
or support its growth and strategic options.
Strategic Risk
Strategic
risk
is
the
risk
arising
from
adverse
business
decisions,
poor
implementation
of
business
decisions,
or
lack
of
responsiveness
to
changes
in
the
banking
industry,
and
operating
environment.
This
risk
is
a
function
of
the
compatibility
of
the
Corporation’s strategic
goals, the business strategies
developed to achieve
those goals, the resources deployed
against these goals, and
the quality of implementation.
Information Technology
Risk
Information technology
risk is
the risk
arising from
the loss of
confidentiality,
integrity,
or availability
of information
systems and
risk
of
cyber
incidents
or
data
breaches.
It
includes
business
risks
associated
with
the
use,
ownership,
operation,
involvement,
influence, and adoption of information technology within the Corporation.

Management Roles and Responsibilities
While
the
Board
of
Directors
has
the
responsibility
to
oversee
the
risk
governance
program,
management
is
responsible
for
implementing
the necessary
policies and
procedures,
and internal
controls. To
carry out
these responsibilities,
the Corporation
has a
clearly
defined
risk governance
culture. To
ensure that
risk management
is communicated
at all
levels of
the Corporation,
and each
area understands
its specific
role, the
Corporation has
established several
management level
committees to
support risk
oversight, as
follows:
Executive Risk Management Committee
The
Executive
Risk
Management
Committee
is
responsible
for
exercising
oversight
of
information
regarding
First
BanCorp.’s
enterprise
risk
management
framework,
including
the
significant
policies,
procedures,
and
practices
employed
to
manage
the
identified
risk
categories
(credit
risk,
operational
risk,
legal
and
regulatory
risk,
reputational
risk,
model
risk,
and
capital
risk).
In
carrying
out
its
oversight
responsibilities,
each
committee
member
is
entitled
to
rely
on
the
integrity
and
expertise
of
those
people
providing
information
to
the committee
and
on
the
accuracy
and
completeness
of
such
information,
absent
actual
knowledge
of
an
inaccuracy.
The
Chief
Executive
Officer
appoints
the
Executive
Risk Management
Committee
and members
of
the Corporation’s
senior
and
executive management have
the opportunity to
share their insights about
the types of risks
that could impede
the Corporation’s
ability
to achieve
its business
objectives. The
Chief Risk
Officer
of the
Corporation directs
the agenda
for
the meetings
and the
Enterprise
Risk Management
(“ERM”) and
Operational Risk
Director serves
as secretary
of the
committee and
maintains the
minutes on
behalf
of the committee. The General Auditor also participates of the committee as an
observer.
The
committee
provides
assistance
and
support
to
the
Chief
Risk
Officer
to
promote
effective
risk
management
throughout
the
Corporation.
The
Chief
Risk
Officer
and
the
ERM
and
Operational
Risk
Director
report
to
the
Committee
matters
related
to
the
enterprise risk management framework of the Corporation, including, but not
limited to:
●
The risk governance structure;
●
The risk competencies of the Corporation;
●
The Corporation’s risk appetite
statement and risk tolerance; and
●
The risk management
strategy and associated risk
management initiatives and
how both support
the business strategy
and business model of the Corporation.
Other Management Committees
As
part
of
its
governance
framework,
the
Corporation
has
various
additional
risk
management
related-committees.
These
committees are
jointly responsible
for ensuring
adequate risk
measurement and
management in
their respective
areas of authority.
At
the management level, these committees include:
●
Management’s
Investment and
Asset Liability Committee
(the
“MIALCO”) - oversees
interest rate
and market
risk, liquidity
management
and
other
related
matters.

Liquidity Risk and Capital Adequacy,
Interest Rate Risk, Credit Risk, Operational Risk,
Legal and Compliance Risk and
Concentration Risk Management
The
following
discussion
highlights
First
BanCorp.’s
adopted
policies
and
procedures
for
liquidity
risk
and
capital
adequacy,
interest rate risk, credit risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk,
and concentration risk.
Liquidity Risk and Capital Adequacy
Liquidity
risk
involves
the
ongoing
ability
to
accommodate
liability
maturities
and
deposit
withdrawals,
fund
asset growth
and
business operations,
and meet
contractual obligations
through unconstrained
access to funding
at reasonable
market rates. Liquidity
management
involves
forecasting
funding
requirements
and
maintaining
sufficient
capacity
to
meet
liquidity
needs
and
accommodate
fluctuations
in
asset
and
liability
levels
due
to
changes
in
the
Corporation’s
business
operations
or
unanticipated
events.
The Corporation
manages liquidity
at two
levels. The
first is
the liquidity
of the
parent company,
which is
the holding
company
that owns
the banking
and non-banking
subsidiaries.
The second
is the
liquidity of
the banking
subsidiary.
During the
year
ended
December 31, 2021, the
Corporation continued to pay
quarterly interest payments on
the subordinated debentures
associated with its
TRuPs, the
monthly dividend
income on
its non-cumulative
perpetual monthly
income preferred
stock, and
quarterly dividends
on
its
common
stock.
In
addition, since
the
inception of
the
$300
million stock
repurchase program through
December 31,
2021, the
Corporation has repurchased 16.74 million
shares at
a
cost of
$213.9 million and
redeemed all of
its outstanding shares of
Series A
through E
Preferred
Stock for
its liquidation
value of
$36.1 million.
The
Asset
and
Liability
Committee
of
the
Corporation’s
Board
of
Directors
is
responsible
for
overseeing
management’s
establishment
of
the
Corporation’s
liquidity
policy,
as
well
as
approving
operating
and
contingency
procedures
and
monitoring
liquidity on an ongoing basis. The
MIALCO, which reports to the Board
of Directors’ Asset and Liability Committee,
uses measures
of liquidity developed by management that involve
the use of several assumptions to review the Corporation’s
liquidity position on a
monthly basis. The MIALCO oversees liquidity management, interest
rate risk, and other related matters.
The MIALCO is composed of
senior management officers,
including the Chief Executive Officer,
the Chief Financial Officer,
the
Chief Risk
Officer,
the Business
Group
Director,
the Strategy
Management Director,
the Treasury
and Investments
Risk Manager,
the Financial Planning and ALM Director
,
and the Treasurer.
The Treasury and Investments
Division is responsible for planning and
executing the Corporation’s
funding activities and strategy,
monitoring liquidity availability on
a daily basis, and reviewing liquidity
measures
on
a
weekly
basis.
The
Treasury
and
Investments
Accounting
and
Operations
area
of
the
Comptroller’s
Department
is
responsible
for
calculating
the liquidity
measurements
used
by
the
Treasury
and
Investment
Division
to
review
the
Corporation’s
liquidity
position
on
a
monthly
basis.
The
Financial
Planning
and
ALM
Division
is
responsible
to
estimates
the
liquidity
gap
for
longer periods.
To
ensure
adequate liquidity
through the
full range
of potential
operating
environments and
market conditions,
the Corporation
conducts
its
liquidity
management
and
business
activities
in
a
manner
that
is
intended
to
preserve
and
enhance
funding
stability,
flexibility,
and
diversity.
Key
components
of
this
operating
strategy
include
a
strong
focus
on
the
continued
development
of
customer-based
funding, the
maintenance
of direct
relationships with
wholesale
market funding
providers, and
the maintenance
of
the ability to liquidate certain assets when, and if, requirements warrant.
The
Corporation
develops
and
maintains
contingency
funding
plans.
These
plans
evaluate
the
Corporation’s
liquidity
position
under various
operating circumstances
and are
designed to
help ensure
that the
Corporation will
be able
to operate
through periods
of stress when
access to normal
sources of funds
is constrained. The
plans project funding
requirements during
a potential period
of
stress, specify and
quantify sources of
liquidity,
outline actions and
procedures for effectively
managing liquidity through
a difficult
period, and define
roles and responsibilities
for the Corporation’s
employees. Under the
contingency funding plans,
the Corporation
stresses the
balance sheet
and the liquidity
position to
critical levels
that mimic
difficulties in
generating funds
or even maintaining
the current
funding position
of the
Corporation and
the Bank
and are
designed to
help ensure
the ability
of the
Corporation and
the
Bank to honor
their respective commitments.
The Corporation has
established liquidity
triggers that the
MIALCO monitors in
order
to
maintain
the
ordinary
funding
of
the
banking
business.
The
MIALCO
developed
contingency
funding
plans
for
the
following
three scenarios:
a credit
rating downgrade,
an economic
cycle downturn
event, and
a concentration
event. The
Board of
Directors’
Asset and Liability Committee reviews and approves these plans on an annual
basis.
The Corporation
manages its
liquidity in
a proactive
manner,
in an
effort to
maintain a
sound liquidity
position. It
uses multiple
measures
to
monitor
the
liquidity
position,
including
core
liquidity,
basic
liquidity,
and
time-based
reserve
measures.
As
of
December 31,
2021, the
estimated core
liquidity reserve
(which includes
cash and
free liquid
assets) was
$5.6 billion,
or 27.0%
of
total
assets,
compared
to
$4.1
billion,
or
21.6%
of
total
assets
as
of
December
31,
2020.
The
basic
liquidity
ratio
(which
adds
available secured lines of credit to the core liquidity)
was approximately 32.7% of total assets as of December 31,
2021, compared to
27.9% of total
assets as of
December
31, 2020.
As of December
31, 2021, the
Corporation had $1.2
billion available
for additional
credit from the
FHLB. Unpledged liquid
securities, mainly fixed-rate
MBS and U.S. agency
debentures, amounted to
approximately
$3.1
billion as of
December 31, 2021.
The Corporation does
not rely on
uncommitted inter-bank
lines of credit
(federal funds lines)
to fund its
operations and does
not include them
in the basic liquidity
measure. As of
December 31, 2021,
the holding company
had
$20.8
million
of
cash
and
cash
equivalents.
Cash
and
cash
equivalents
at
the
Bank
level
as
of
December
31,
were
approximately $2.5
billion. The Bank
had $100.4
million in brokered
CDs as of
December 31, 2021,
of which approximately
$63.6
million
mature
over
the
next
twelve
months.
In
addition,
the
Corporation
had
non-maturity
brokered
deposits
totaling
$247.5
million as of
December 31, 2021.
Liquidity at the
Bank level is
highly dependent
on bank deposits,
which fund
86% of the
Bank’s
assets (or 85%, excluding brokered CDs).
Furthermore, as
a provider of
financial services,
the Corporation routinely
enters into commitments
with off-balance
sheet risk to
meet the
financial needs
of its
customers. These
financial instruments
may include
loan commitments
and standby
letters of
credit.
These
commitments
are
subject
to
the
same
credit
policies
and
approval
processes
used
for
on-balance
sheet
instruments.
These
instruments involve, to varying degrees,
elements of credit and interest rate risk
in excess of the amount recognized in
the statements
of financial
condition. As
of December
31, 2021,
the Corporation’s
commitments to
extend credit
amounted to
approximately $2.3
billion,
of
which
$1.2
billion
related
to
credit
card
loans.
Commercial
and
financial
standby
letters
of
credit
amounted
to
approximately $151.1 million. Commitments
to extend credit are agreements
to lend to a customer
as long as there is
no violation of
any
condition
established
in
the
contract.
Since
certain
commitments
are
expected
to
expire
without
being
drawn
upon,
the
total
commitment
amount
does
not
necessarily
represent
future
cash
requirements.
For
most
of
the
commercial
lines
of
credit,
the
Corporation
has
the
option
to
reevaluate
the
agreement
prior
to
additional
disbursements.
There
have
been
no
significant
or
unexpected draws
on existing
commitments. In
the case
of credit
cards and
personal lines
of credit,
the Corporation
can cancel
the
unused credit facility at any time and without cause.
The
Corporation
engages
in
the ordinary
course
of business
in
other
financial
transactions
that
are not
recorded
on the
balance
sheet,
or
may
be
recorded
on
the
balance
sheet
in
amounts
that
are
different
from
the
full
contract
or
notional
amount
of
the
transaction and thus,
affecting the Corporation’s
liquidity position.
These transactions are
designed to (i)
meet the financial needs
of
customers, (ii) manage the
Corporation’s credit,
market and liquidity risks, (iii)
diversify the Corporation’s
funding sources, and (iv)
optimize capital.
In addition to the
aforementioned off-balance
sheet debt obligations
and unfunded commitments
to extend credit,
the Corporation
has obligations and commitments to make future
payments under contracts, amounting to approximately
$3.3 billion as of December
31,
2021.
Our
material
cash requirements
comprise
primarily
of
contractual
obligations
to
make
future
payments
related
to
time
deposits,
short-term
borrowings,
long-term
debt,
and
operating
lease
obligations.
We
also
have
other
contractual
cash
obligations
related
to
certain
binding
agreements
we
have
entered
into
for
services
including,
outsourcing
of
technology
services,
security,
advertising and
other services
which are
not material
to our
liquidity needs.
We
currently anticipate
that our
available funds,
credit
facilities, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient
to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.
Off-balance sheet
transactions are continuously
monitored to consider
their potential impact
to our liquidity
position and changes
are applied to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate
to maintain a sound liquidity position.
Sources of Funding
The
Corporation
utilizes
different
sources
of
funding
to
help
ensure
that
adequate
levels
of
liquidity
are
available
when
needed.
Diversification of
funding sources is
of great importance
to protect the
Corporation’s
liquidity from market
disruptions. The principal
sources
of
short-term
funds
are
deposits,
including
brokered
deposits,
securities
sold
under
agreements
to
repurchase,
and
lines
of
credit with the FHLB.
The Asset and Liability Committee
reviews credit availability on
a regular basis. The Corporation has
also sold mortgage loans as
a
supplementary source
of funding and
participates in the
Borrower-in-Custody (“BIC”)
Program of the
FED. The Corporation
has also
obtained long-term funding in the past through the issuance of notes
and long-term brokered CDs.
As of December
31, 2021,
the amounts of
brokered CDs had
decreased by
$115.8 million
to $100.4
million from brokered
CDs of
$216.2 million
as of
December 31,
2020.
Non-maturity brokered
deposits, such
as money
market accounts
maintained by
a deposit
broker,
increased in
2021 by
$22.0 million
to $247.5
million as
of December
31, 2021.
Consistent with
its strategy,
the Corporation
has
been
seeking
to
add
core
deposits.
As
of
December
31,
2021,
the
Corporation’s
deposits,
excluding
brokered
deposits
and
government deposits,
increased by $1.4 billion to $14.2
billion, compared to $12.8 billion as of
December 31, 2020. This increase
was
primarily reflected in both commercial and retail demand deposits, partially
offset by a decrease in retail CDs.
The
Corporation
continues
to
have
access
to
financing
through
counterparties
to
repurchase
agreements,
the
FHLB,
and
other
agents, such
as wholesale funding
brokers. While liquidity
is an ongoing
challenge for all
financial institutions,
management believes
that
the
Corporation’s
available
borrowing
capacity
and
efforts
to
grow
retail
deposits
will
be
adequate
to
provide
the
necessary
funding for the Corporation’s business
plans in the foreseeable future.
The Corporation’s principal
sources of funding are discussed below:

Estimate of
Uninsured
Deposits
-
At December
31,
2021 and
2020,
the estimated
amount of
uninsured
deposits totaled
$8.9
billion
and $6.8
billion, respectively,
generally representing
the portion
of deposits
in domestic
offices that
exceed the
FDIC insurance
limit
of $250,000
and amounts
in any
other uninsured
deposit account.
The amount
of uninsured
deposits is
calculated based
on the
same
methodologies and assumptions used for our bank regulatory reporting
requirements.
The following table presents by contractual maturities the amount of U.S. time deposits in
excess of FDIC insurance limits
(over $250,000) and other time deposits that are otherwise uninsured

Exclude $100.4 million
of CDs
issued to deposit
brokers in the
form of large
certificates of deposits
that are generally
participated out
by brokers in
shares of less
than the FDIC
insurance limit.
Brokered
CDs
- Total
brokered CDs decreased
during 2021
by $115.8
million to $100.4
million as of
December 31, 2021,
compared
to $216.2 million as of December 31, 2020.
The average remaining term to maturity of the brokered CDs outstanding
as of December 31, 2021 was approximately 1.2 years.
The
use
of
brokered
CDs
has
historically
been
an
additional
source
of
funding
for
the
Corporation.
It
provides
an
additional
efficient
channel
for
funding diversification
and
interest
rate management.
Brokered
CDs are
insured
by
the FDIC
up to
regulatory
limits; and can
be obtained faster than
regular retail deposits.
In addition, the
Corporation may obtain
funds from brokers deposited
in
non-maturity money market accounts tied to short-term money market rates
such as the Federal funds rate.
Government deposits
- As of
December 31,
2021, the Corporation
had $2.7 billion
of Puerto Rico
public sector deposits
($2.5 billion
in transactional accounts and $173.7 million
in time deposits), compared to $1.8 billion
as of December 31, 2020. Approximately
19%
of
the
public
sector
deposits
as
of
December
31,
was
from
municipalities
and
municipal
agencies
in
Puerto
Rico
and
81%
was from
public
corporations,
the
central
government
and
agencies,
and
U.S.
federal
government
agencies
in
Puerto
Rico.
The
increase was primarily
related to the
funding of
certain operational
reserve accounts
of PREPA
to operate
Puerto Rico’s
electric grid,
as well as
increases in the
balance of transactional
deposit accounts of
certain municipalities in
connection with the
American Rescue
Plan Act (“ARPA”)
funding for states and local governments.
In
addition,
as
of
December
31,
2021,
the
Corporation
had
$568.4
million
of
government
deposits
in
the
Virgin
Islands
region
(December
31,
- $280.2
million)
and
$9.6
million
in
the
Florida
region.
(December
31,
-
$9.7
million).
The increase
in
government deposits in
the Virgin
Islands region also
reflects the effect
of ARPA
federal funds received
by the central
government in
the second quarter of 2021.
Retail deposits
- The
Corporation’s
deposit products
also include
regular savings
accounts, demand
deposit accounts,
money market
accounts,
and
retail
CDs.
Total
deposits,
excluding
brokered
deposits
and
government
deposits,
increased
by
$1.4
billion
to
$14.2
billion from
a balance of
$12.8 billion as
of December 31,
2020, reflecting
increases of $1.1
billion in the
Puerto Rico region,
$196.2
million
in
the
Florida
region,
and
$98.1
million
in
the
Virgin
Islands
region.
On
a
deposit
type
basis,
the
increase
was
primarily
reflected
in both
commercial
and
retail demand
deposits,
partially
offset
by a
decrease
in retail
CDs. The
BSPR system
conversion
resulted in a
net reclassification
of approximately
$724 million
in balances from
interest-bearing demand
deposits, and certain
saving
products, to non-interest-bearing products at the time of conversion on July
12, 2021.
Refer to “Net Interest Income”
above for information about
average balances of interest-bearing
deposits, and the average interest
rate
paid on deposits for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Borrowings
As of December 31, 2021, total borrowings amounted to $683.8 million, compared
to $923.8 million
as of December 31, 2020.
The following table presents the composition of total borrowings as of the dates indicated:

Securities
sold
under
agreements
to
repurchase
-
The
Corporation’s
investment
portfolio
is
funded
in
part
with
repurchase
agreements.
The
Corporation’s
outstanding
securities
sold
under
repurchase
agreements
amounted
to
$300
million
as
of
each
of
December 31,
2021 and
2020, respectively.
One of the
Corporation’s
strategies has
been the
use of
structured repurchase
agreements
and
long-term
repurchase
agreements
to
reduce
liquidity
risk
and
manage
exposure
to
interest
rate
risk
by
lengthening
the
final
maturities
of
its
liabilities
while
keeping
funding
costs
at
reasonable
levels.
In
addition
to
these
repurchase
agreements,
the
Corporation
has
been
able
to
maintain
access
to
credit
by
using
cost-effective
sources
such
as
FHLB
advances.
See
Note
-
Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase, in the accompanying
audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of
this Form 10-K, for further details about repurchase agreements outstanding
by counterparty and maturities.
Under the Corporation’s
repurchase agreements, as
is the case with
derivative contracts,
the Corporation is
required to pledge
cash
or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements.
To the extent that the value
of securities previously pledged as collateral declines
due to changes in interest
rates, a liquidity crisis or
any other factor, the
Corporation is required to deposit
additional cash or securities
to meet its margin requirements, thereby adversely affecting
its liquidity.
Given
the
quality
of
the
collateral
pledged,
the
Corporation
has
not
experienced
margin
calls
from
counterparties
arising
from
credit-quality-related write-downs in valuations.
Advances from
the FHLB -
The Bank is
a member of
the FHLB system
and obtains advances
to fund its
operations under a
collateral
agreement with the FHLB that requires the Bank to maintain
qualifying mortgages
and/or investments as collateral for advances taken.
As of
December 31,
2021, the
outstanding balance
of long-term
fixed rate
FHLB advances
was $200.0
million, compared
to $440.0
million as of
December 31, 2020.
As of December
31, 2021, the
Corporation had $1.2
billion available for
additional credit on
FHLB
lines of credit.
Trust-Preferred
Securities
-
In
2004,
FBP
Statutory
Trust
I,
a
statutory
trust
that
is
wholly-owned
by
the
Corporation
and
not
consolidated
in
the
Corporation’s
financial
statements,
sold
to
institutional
investors
$100
million
of
its
variable-rate
TRuPs.
FBP
Statutory Trust
I used
the proceeds
of the
issuance, together
with the
proceeds of
the purchase
by the
Corporation of
$3.1 million
of
FBP Statutory
Trust
I
variable
rate
common
securities, to
purchase
$103.1
million
aggregate
principal
amount
of the
Corporation’s
junior subordinated deferrable debentures.
Also
in
2004,
FBP
Statutory
Trust
II,
a
statutory
trust
that
is
wholly-owned
by
the
Corporation
and
not
consolidated
in
the
Corporation’s
financial statements,
sold to institutional
investors $125
million of its
variable-rate TRuPs.
FBP Statutory
Trust II
used
the proceeds
of the
issuance, together
with the
proceeds of
the purchase
by the
Corporation of
$3.9 million
of FBP Statutory
Trust II
variable
rate
common
securities,
to
purchase
$128.9
million
aggregate
principal
amount
of
the
Corporation’s
junior
subordinated
deferrable debentures.
The subordinated debentures
are presented in
the Corporation’s
consolidated statements of
financial condition as
other borrowings.
The variable-rate TRuPs are fully and unconditionally
guaranteed by the Corporation. The $100 million
junior subordinated deferrable
debentures
issued
by
the
Corporation
in
April
and
the
$125
million
issued
in
September
mature
on
June
17,
and
September
20,
2034,
respectively;
however,
under
certain
circumstances,
the
maturity
of
the
subordinated
debentures
may
be
shortened (such shortening would result in a mandatory
redemption of the variable-rate TRuPs). The Collins Amendment of the Dodd-
Frank
Act
eliminated
certain
TRuPs
from
Tier
Capital.
Bank
holding
companies,
such
as
the
Corporation,
were
required
to
fully
phase out
these instruments
from Tier
I capital
by January
1, 2016;
however,
they may
remain in
Tier 2
capital until
the instruments
are redeemed or mature.
As of
each of
December 31,
and 2020,
the Corporation
had subordinated
debentures outstanding
in the
aggregate amount
of
$183.8
million.
As
of
December
31,
2021,
the
Corporation
was
current
on
all
interest
payments
due
related
to
its
subordinated
debentures.
Other Sources of
Funds and Liquidity
- The Corporation’s
principal uses of funds are for
the origination of loans and the repayment
of
maturing deposits and borrowings.
In connection with its mortgage banking
activities, the Corporation has invested
in technology and
personnel to enhance the Corporation’s
secondary mortgage market capabilities.
The enhanced
capabilities improve
the Corporation’s
liquidity profile
as they
allow the
Corporation
to derive
liquidity,
if needed,
from the sale
of mortgage loans
in the secondary
market. The U.S. (including
Puerto Rico) secondary
mortgage market is
still highly-
liquid, in
large part
because of
the sale
of mortgages
through guarantee
programs of
the FHA,
VA,
U.S. Department
of Housing
and
Urban Development
(“HUD”), FNMA, and
FHLMC. During
the year
ended December 31,
2021, the
Corporation sold approximately
$191.4
million of FHA/VA
mortgage loans to GNMA, which packages them into MBS.
In
addition,
the
FED
has
taken
several
steps to
promote
economic
and
financial
stability
in
response
to
the significant
economic
disruption
caused by
the COVID-19
pandemic.
These
actions are
intended
to stimulate
economic
activity
by reducing
interest
rates
and provide
liquidity to
financial markets
so that
participants have
access to
needed funding.
Federal funds
target rate
remained at
a
range of
0% to
0.25%, making
the Primary
Credit FED
Discount Window
Program a
cost-efficient
contingent source
of funding
for
the Corporation given
the highly-volatile market
conditions. Although
currently not in
use, as of
December 31, 2021,
the Corporation
had approximately $1.2 billion available for funding under the FED’s
BIC Program.
Effect of Credit Ratings on Access to Liquidity
The
Corporation’s
liquidity
is
contingent
upon
its
ability
to
obtain
external
sources
of
funding
to
finance
its
operations.
The
Corporation’s
current credit
ratings and any
downgrade in credit
ratings can hinder
the Corporation’s
access to new
forms of external
funding
and/or
cause
external
funding
to
be
more
expensive,
which
could,
in
turn,
adversely
affect
its
results
of
operations.
Also,
changes in
credit ratings
may further
affect the
fair value
of unsecured
derivatives whose
value takes
into account
the Corporation’s
own credit risk.
The Corporation
does not
have any
outstanding debt
or derivative
agreements that
would be
affected by
credit rating
downgrades.
Furthermore, given the Corporation’s
non-reliance on corporate debt or
other instruments directly linked in
terms of pricing or volume
to credit
ratings, the
liquidity of
the Corporation
has not been
affected in
any material
way by downgrades.
The Corporation’s
ability
to access new non-deposit sources of funding, however,
could be adversely affected by credit downgrades.
As of
the date
hereof,
the Corporation’s
credit as
a long-term
issuer is
rated
B+ by
S&P and
BB by
Fitch. As
of the
date hereof,
FirstBank’s
credit ratings
as a
long-term
issuer are
B1 by
Moody’s,
four notches
below their
definition
of investment
grade;
BB by
S&P,
two
notches
below
their
definition
of
investment
grade;
and
BB
by
Fitch,
two
notches
below
their
definition
of
investment
grade.
The
Corporation’s
credit
ratings
are
dependent
on
a
number
of
factors,
both
quantitative
and
qualitative,
and
are
subject
to
change
at any
time. The
disclosure of
credit ratings
is not
a recommendation
to buy,
sell, or
hold the
Corporation’s
securities. Each
rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
Cash Flows
Cash and cash
equivalents were $2.5
billion as of
December 31, 2021,
an increase of
$1.0 billion when
compared to the
balance as
of December
31, 2020.
The following
discussion highlights
the major
activities and
transactions that
affected
the Corporation’s
cash
flows during 2021 and 2020:
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
First BanCorp.’s
operating assets and
liabilities vary significantly
in the normal course
of business due to
the amount and timing
of
cash flows.
Management believes
that cash
flows from
operations, available
cash balances,
and the
Corporation’s
ability to
generate
cash through
short and long-term
borrowings will be
sufficient to
fund the Corporation’
s
operating liquidity
needs for the
foreseeable
future.
For the years ended December
31, 2021 and 2020, net
cash provided by operating activities
was $399.7 million and
$297.7 million,
respectively.
Net cash generated
from operating
activities was higher
than reported
net income,
largely as
a result of
adjustments for
items such as deferred
income tax, depreciation,
and amortization, as
well as the cash
generated from sales of
loans held for sale,
and,
in 2020, the provision for credit losses expense.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
The Corporation’s
investing activities primarily
relate to originating
loans to be
held for investment,
as well as
purchasing, selling,
and
repaying
available-for-sale
and
held-to-maturity investment
securities. For
the year
ended
December
31, 2021,
net cash
used in
investing
activities
was
$1.3
billion,
primarily
due
to
purchases
of
U.S.
agencies
investment
securities
and
liquidity
used
to
fund
commercial and
consumer loan
originations, partially
offset by
principal collected
on loans
and U.S.
agencies MBS
prepayments,
as
well as proceeds from U.S. agencies bonds called prior to
maturity, the bulk sale of
residential mortgage nonaccrual loans, and the sale
of criticized commercial and construction loans
.
For the year
ended December 31,
2020, net cash
used in investing
activities was $1.2
billion, primarily
resulting from purchases
of
U.S.
agencies,
MBS and
the funding
of
commercial
and
consumer
loan
originations,
partially
offset
by principal
collected
on loans
and
on
U.S. agencies
MBS prepayments,
proceeds from
U.S. agencies
bonds
that matured
or were
called
prior
to maturity,
and
the
excess of cash acquired in the BSPR acquisition over the cash consideration
paid at closing.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
The Corporation’s
financing activities
primarily
include the
receipt of
deposits and
the issuance
of brokered
CDs, the
issuance of
and payments
on long-term
debt, the
issuance of
equity instruments,
return of
capital, and
activities related
to its
short-term funding.
For
the
year
ended
December 31,
2021,
net
cash
provided
by
financing
activities
was $1.9
billion,
mainly
reflecting an
increase
in
non-brokered deposits, partially offset
by dividends paid on common and preferred
stock, repurchases of common and preferred
stock,
and repayment of matured FHLB advances and brokered CDs.
For the
year ended
December 31,
2020, net
cash provided by
financing activities
was $1.8
billion, mainly
reflecting an
increase in
non-brokered
deposits
and,
to
a
lesser
extent,
proceed
from
the
early
cancellation
of
long-term
reverse
repurchase
agreements
that
were previously
offset against
variable-rate repurchase
agreements, partially
offset by
dividends paid
on common and
preferred stock
and repayment of matured FHLB advances.
Capital
As of December 31, 2021, the Corporation’s
stockholders’ equity was $2.1 billion, a decrease
of $173.4 million from December 31,
2020. The decrease
was driven by
the approximately $317.8
million of capital
returned to the
Corporation’s
stockholders during 2021
consisting of:
(i) the
repurchase of
16.7 million
shares of
common stock
for a
total purchase
price of
approximately $213.9
million;
(ii) common
and preferred
stock dividends
totaling $67.8
million; and
(iii) the
redemption of
all of
its outstanding
shares of
Series A
through E
Preferred Stock
for its total
liquidation value
of $36.1
million. The
decrease in
total stockholders’
equity also
included the
effect of
a $139.5
million decrease
in Other
Comprehensive Income
mostly attributable
to the
decrease in
the fair
value of
available-
for-sale investment
securities. These variances
were partially offset
by earnings generated
during 2021.
The Corporation
increase its
common stock dividend
twice during 2021,
increasing the quarterly
dividend rate from
$0.05 in the fourth
quarter of 2020
to $0.07 in
the first
quarter of
2021 and
$0.10 in
the fourth
quarter of
2021.
The Corporation
intends to continue
to pay
quarterly dividends
on
common
stock.
The
Corporation’s
common
stock
dividends,
including
the
declaration,
timing
and
amount,
remain
subject
to
the
consideration and approval by the Corporation’s
Board of Directors at the relevant times.
On April
26, 2021,
the Corporation
announced that
its Board
of Directors
approved a
stock repurchase
program, under
which the
Corporation may
repurchase up
to $300 million
of its outstanding
stock, commencing
in the second
quarter of
2021 through June
30,
2022.
Repurchases
under
the
program
may
be
executed
through
open
market
purchases,
accelerated
share
repurchases,
and/or
privately
negotiated
transactions
or
plans,
including
under
plans
complying
with
Rule
10b5-1
under
the
Exchange
Act.
The
Corporation’s
stock
repurchase
program
will
be
subject
to
various
factors,
including
the
Corporation’s
capital
position,
liquidity,
financial performance and
alternative uses of capital, stock
trading price, and
general market conditions.
The repurchase program may
be modified,
extended, suspended,
or terminated
at any
time at the
Corporation’s
discretion and
includes the
redemption of
the $36.1
million
in
outstanding
shares
of
the
Corporation’s
Series
A
through
E
Noncumulative
Perpetual
Monthly
Income
Preferred
Stock.
The Corporation’s
share repurchase program
does not obligate
it to acquire
any specific number
of shares.
As of December
31, 2021,
the
Corporation
had
remaining
authorization
to repurchase
approximately
$50
million
of common
stock under
the
stock repurchase
program.
During
the first
quarter
of 2022,
the Corporation
repurchased
3.4
million
shares of
common
stock for
the
remaining $50
million
authorized under the aforementioned
$300 million stock repurchase
program.
The Parent Company has
no operations and depends
on
dividends,
distributions
and
other
payments
from
its
subsidiaries
to
fund
dividend
payments,
stock
repurchases,
and
to
fund
all
payments on its obligations, including debt obligations.

As permitted by the regulatory capital framework, the Corporation
elected to delay for two years the day-one impact related to
the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020
plus 25% of the change in the ACL from January 1, 2020 to
December 31, 2021. Such effects, will be phased
in at 25% per year beginning on January 1, 2022.
The
Corporation
and
FirstBank
compute
risk-weighted
assets
using
the
standardized
approach
required
by
U.S.
Basel
III
capital
rules (“Basel
III rules”).
The Basel
III rules
require the
Corporation to
maintain an
additional capital
conservation buffer
of 2.5%
of
additional
CET1 capital
to avoid
limitations
on both
(i) capital
distributions
(
e.g.
, repurchases
of
capital instruments,
dividends
and
interest
payments
on
capital
instruments),
and
(ii)
discretionary
bonus
payments
to
executive
officers
and
heads
of
major
business
lines.
Under
the
Basel
III
rules,
in
order
to
be
considered
adequately
capitalized
and
not
subject
to
the
above
noted
limitations,
the
Corporation is
required to
maintain: (i) a
minimum CET1
capital to risk-weighted
assets ratio of
at least 4.5%,
plus the 2.5%
“capital
conservation buffer,”
resulting in a required
minimum CET1 capital
ratio of at
least 7%; (ii) a
minimum ratio of
total Tier 1
capital to
risk-weighted assets of at least
6.0%, plus the 2.5%
capital conservation buffer,
resulting in a required minimum
Tier 1 capital ratio
of
8.5%;
(iii)
a
minimum
ratio
of
total
Tier
plus
Tier
capital
to
risk-weighted
assets
of
at
least
8.0%,
plus
the
2.5%
capital
conservation buffer,
resulting in
a required
minimum total
capital ratio
of 10.5%;
and (iv)
a required
minimum leverage
ratio of
4%,
calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average
on-balance sheet (non-risk adjusted) assets.
As part
of its
response to
the impact
of COVID-19,
on March
31, 2020,
the federal
banking agencies
issued an
interim final
rule
that
provided
the
option
to
temporarily
delay
the
effects
of
CECL
on
regulatory
capital
for
two
years,
followed
by
a
three-year
transition period.
The interim final
rule provides that,
at the election
of a qualified
banking organization,
the initial impact
to retained
earnings
related
to
the
adoption
of
CECL
plus 25%
of
the
change
in
the
ACL
(excluding
PCD
loans)
from
January
1,
to
December
31,
will
be
delayed
for
two
years
and
phased-in
at 25%
per
year
beginning
on
January
1,
over
a
three-year
period,
resulting
in
a
total
transition
period
of
five
years.
Accordingly,
as
of
December
31,
2021,
the
capital
measures
of
the
Corporation and
the Bank
shown in the
table above
excluded $64.8 million
that represents the
initial impact
to retained
earnings plus
25% of the increase in the ACL (as defined in the interim final rule)
from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021. The federal financial
regulatory agencies may
take other measures
affecting regulatory capital
to address the COVID-19
pandemic, although the
nature and
impact of such measures cannot be predicted at this time.

The Banking Law
of the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico requires that
a minimum of 10%
of FirstBank’s
net income for the
year be
transferred
to a
legal surplus
reserve
until such
surplus
equals the
total of
paid-in-capital on
common and
preferred stock.
Amounts
transferred
to
the
legal
surplus
reserve
from
retained
earnings
are
not
available
for
distribution
to
the
Corporation,
including
for
payment
as dividends
to the
stockholders,
without
the prior
consent
of the
Puerto Rico
Commissioner
of Financial
Institutions.
The
Puerto Rico Banking Law
provides that, when the
expenditures of a Puerto
Rico commercial bank are
greater than receipts, the excess
of
the
expenditures
over
receipts
must
be
charged
against
the
undistributed
profits
of
the
bank,
and
the
balance,
if
any,
must
be
charged against
the legal
surplus reserve,
as a
reduction thereof.
If the
legal surplus
reserve is
not sufficient
to cover
such balance
in
whole or
in part,
the outstanding
amount must
be charged
against the
capital account
and the
Bank cannot
pay dividends
until it
can
replenish the
legal surplus
reserve to
an amount
of at
least 20% of
the original
capital contributed.
During the
years ended
December
31, 2021 and
2020, the Corporation
transferred $28.3 million
and $11.7
million, respectively,
to the legal
surplus reserve. FirstBank’s
legal
surplus
reserve,
included
as
part
of
retained
earnings
in
the
Corporation’s
consolidated
statements
of
financial
condition,
amounted to $137.6 and $109.3 million as of December 31, 2021
and 2020, respectively.
Interest
Rate Risk
Management
First
BanCorp
manages
its
asset/liability
position
to
limit
the
effects
of
changes
in
interest
rates
on
net
interest
income
and
to
maintain a stable
level of profitability under
varying interest rate scenarios.
The MIALCO oversees
interest rate risk, and,
in doing so,
the
MIALCO assesses,
among
other things,
current and
expected conditions
in world
financial markets,
competition and
prevailing
rates in the local deposit market, liquidity,
the pipeline of loan originations, securities market values, recent
or proposed changes to the
investment
portfolio,
alternative
funding
sources and
related
costs,
hedging
and
the possible
purchase
of derivatives,
such
as swaps
and caps, and any
tax or regulatory issues
which may be pertinent
to these areas. The
MIALCO approves funding
decisions in light of
the Corporation’s overall strategies
and objectives.
On a monthly
and/or quarterly basis, the
Corporation performs a
consolidated net interest
income simulation analysis
to estimate the
potential change
in future
earnings from
projected changes
in interest
rates. These
simulations are
carried out
over a
one-to-five-year
time horizon and
assumes upward and
downward yield curve
shifts. The rate
scenarios considered in
these simulations reflect
gradual
upward
and
downward
interest
rate
movements
of
basis
points
during
a
twelve-month
period.
The
Corporation
carries
out
the
simulations in two ways:
(1) Using a static balance sheet, as the Corporation had on the simulation date,
and
(2) Using a dynamic balance sheet based on recent patterns and current
strategies.
The balance
sheet is
divided into
groups of
assets and
liabilities by
maturity or
re-pricing structure
and their
corresponding interest
yields and
costs. As interest
rates rise or
fall, these
simulations incorporate
expected future
lending rates,
current and
expected future
funding sources
and costs,
the possible
exercise of
options, changes
in prepayment
rates, deposit
decay and
other factors,
which may
be important in projecting net interest income.
The Corporation uses
a simulation model
to project future movements
in the Corporation’s
balance sheet and
income statement. The
starting point of the projections corresponds to the actual values on
the balance sheet on the date of the simulations.
These
simulations
are
highly complex
and
are based
on many
assumptions
that are
intended
to reflect
the general
behavior
of
the
balance sheet components over
the period in question.
It is unlikely that actual
events will match these
assumptions in most cases.
For
this reason,
the results of
these forward-looking
computations are only
approximations of the
true sensitivity of
net interest income
to
changes in
market interest
rates. The
Corporation uses
several benchmarks
and market rate
curves in
the modeling
process, primarily
the
LIBOR/SWAP
curve,
Prime
Rate,
Treasury,
FHLB
rates,
brokered
CDs
rates,
repurchase
agreements
rates
and
the
years
mortgage commitment rate.
As
of
December
31,
2021,
the
Corporation
forecasted
the
12-month
net
interest
income
assuming
January
31,
interest
rate
curves remain constant. Then,
net interest income was estimated
under rising and falling rates
scenarios. For rising rates
scenarios, the
Corporation
assumed
a
gradual
(ramp)
parallel
upward
shift
of
the
yield
curve
during
the
first
twelve
months
(the
“+200
ramp”
scenario). Conversely,
for the falling rates scenario,
it assumed a gradual (ramp) parallel downward
shift of the yield curves during
the
first
twelve
months
(the
“-200 ramp”
scenario).
However,
given
the current
low levels
of
interest
rates
and rate
compression
in
the
short term, along
with the current yield
curve slope, a
full downward shift
of 200 basis points
would represent an
unrealistic scenario.
Therefore,
under
the
falling
rate
scenario,
rates
move
downward
up
to
basis
points,
but
without
reaching
zero.
The
resulting
scenario shows interest rates close to zero in most cases, reflecting a flattening
yield curve instead of a parallel downward scenario.
The
Libor/Swap
curve
for
January
2022,
as
compared
to
December
2020,
reflected
a
basis
points
increase
in
the
short-term
horizon, between
one to 12
months, while market
rates increased by
126 basis points
in the medium
term, that is
between two
to five
years. In the
long-term, that is
over a five-year-time
horizon, market rates
increased by 93
basis points, as
compared to December
31,
levels.
A
similar
pattern
on
market
rates
changes
were
observed
in
the
Treasury
curve
for
the
short,
medium,
and
long-term
horizons mentioned above with
a 26 basis points increase
in the short-term horizon, 123
basis points increase in the
medium term, and
65 basis points increase in the long-term horizon.
The following table presents the results of the simulations as of December 31, 2021
and 2020.
Consistent with prior years, these
exclude non-cash changes in the fair value of derivatives:

The Corporation continues
to manage
its balance
sheet structure
to control
and limit
the overall
interest rate
risk. As
of December
31,
2021,
the
simulations
showed
that
the
Corporation
continues
to
maintain
an
asset-sensitive
position.
The
Corporation
has
continued repositioning the balance
sheet and improving the
funding mix, mainly driven
by increasing the average
balance of interest-
bearing deposits
with low-rate
elasticity and non
-interest-bearing deposits,
and reductions
in brokered
CDs, time deposits,
and FHLB
Advances.
The above-mentioned
growth in
deposits, along
with proceeds
from loan
repayments, U.S.
agency bonds
that matured
or
were
called
prior
to
maturity
and
prepayments
of
US
agency
MBS,
that
have
been
reinvested
contributed
to
fund
the
continued
increase in the investment securities portfolio, while maintaining higher
liquidity levels.
The increased
net interest
income sensitivity
for the +200bps
ramp as
compared to
December 31,
2020 was
driven by higher
cash
balances
with
short
term
repricing,
an
increase
in
the
investment
securities
portfolio
balance,
lower
prepayment
cash
flows
in
the
investment securities portfolio
due to the level
of securities purchased
during 2021 under a
low interest rate
environment as compared
to the higher
rates forecasted in
the short, medium
and long-term tenors,
and lower balances in
certificate of deposits.
The decrease in
net interest
income sensitivity
for the
-200bps ramp
under the
growing balance
sheet scenario
was driven
by the
current low
level of
interest
rates
that
resulted
in
reduced
prepayments
in
the
investment
securities
portfolio
lower
impact
from
short
term
repricing
categories.
Also, as
a result
of this
lower
rate environment,
near
floor levels,
a full
down parallel
movement of
-200bps will
not be
possible.
Taking
into consideration
the above-mentioned
facts for
modeling purposes,
as of December
31, 2021,
the net interest
income for
the
next
months
under
a
growing
balance
sheet
scenario
was
estimated
to
increase
by
$39.1
million
in
the
rising
rate
scenario,
compared to an
estimated increase of
$36.0 million as
of December 31,
2020.
Under the falling
rate, growing balance
sheet scenario,
the
net
interest
income
was
estimated
to
decrease
by
$13.5
million,
compared
to
an
estimated
decrease
of
$13.9
million
as
of
December 31, 2020,
reflecting the effect
of current low levels
of market interest
rates on the base
scenario and the model
assumptions
for the falling rate scenarios described above (i.e., no negative interest rates
modeled).
Derivatives
First
BanCorp.
uses derivative
instruments
and
other
strategies
to
manage
its exposure
to
interest
rate
risk
caused
by
changes
in
interest rates beyond management’s
control.
The following summarizes major strategies, including derivative activities
that the Corporation uses in managing interest rate risk:
Interest Rate
Cap Agreements
- Interest rate
cap agreements provide
the right to receive
cash if a referen
ce interest rate rises
above
a contractual
rate. The
value of
the interest
rate cap
increases as
the reference
interest rate
rises. The
Corporation enters
into interest
rate cap agreements for protection from rising interest rates.
Forward Contracts
- Forward contracts
are sales of TBA
MBS that will
settle over the
standard delivery date
and do not qualify
as
“regular-way”
security
trades.
Regular-way
security
trades
are
contracts
that
have
no
net
settlement
provision
and
no
market
mechanism
to
facilitate
net
settlement
and
that
provide
for
delivery
of
a
security
within
the
timeframe
generally
established
by
regulations
or
conventions
in
the
market-place
or
exchange
in
which
the
transaction
is
being
executed.
The
forward
sales
are
considered derivative
instruments that
need to be
marked-to-market. The
Corporation uses
these securities
to economically
hedge the
FHA/VA
residential
mortgage
loan
securitizations
of
the
mortgage-banking
operations.
The
Corporation
also
reports
as
forward
contracts the
mandatory mortgage
loan sales
commitments entered
into with
GSEs that
require or
permit net
settlement via
a pair-off
transaction
or
the
payment
of
a
pair-off
fee.
Unrealized
gains
(losses)
are
recognized
as
part
of
mortgage
banking
activities
in
the
consolidated statements of income.
Interest
Rate
Lock
Commitments
-
Interest
rate
lock
commitments
are
agreements
under
which
the
Corporation
agrees to
extend
credit to
a borrower
under certain
specified terms
and conditions
in which
the interest
rate and
the maximum
amount of
the loan
are
set prior
to funding.
Under each
agreement, the
Corporation commits
to lend
funds to
a potential
borrower generally
on a
fixed rate
basis, regardless of whether interest rates change in the market.
Interest rate
swaps
- The
Corporation acquired
interest rate
swaps as
a result
of the
BSPR acquisition.
An interest
rate swap
is an
agreement between
two entities to
exchange cash flows
in the future.
The agreements acquired
from BSPR consist
of the Corporation
offering
borrower-facing
derivative
products using
a “back-to-back”
structure in
which the
borrower-facing
derivative transaction
is
paired with
an identical,
offsetting transaction
with an
approved dealer-counterparty.
By using
a back-to-back
trading structure,
both
the commercial
borrower and
the Corporation
are largely
insulated from
market risk
and volatil
ity.
The agreements
set the
dates on
which the cash flows
will be paid and
the manner in which the
cash flows will be
calculated. The fair value
s
of interest rate swaps
are
recorded as components
of other assets
in the Corporation’s
consolidated statements
of financial condition.
Changes in the
fair values
of
interest
rate
swaps,
which
occur
due
to
changes
in
interest
rates,
are
recorded
in
the
consolidated
statements
of
income
as
a
component of interest income on loans.

Derivative instruments,
such as
interest rate
caps, are
subject to
market risk.
As is
the case
with investment
securities, the
market
value
of
derivative
instruments
is
largely
a
function
of the
financial
market’s
expectations
regarding
the future
direction
of
interest
rates.
Accordingly,
current
market
values
are
not
necessarily
indicative
of
the
future
impact
of
derivative
instruments
on
earnings.
This will depend, in part, on the level of interest rates, as well as the expectations
for rates in the future.
As
of
December
31,
and
2020,
the
Corporation
considered
all
of
its
derivative
instruments
to
be
undesignated
economic
hedges.
The
use
of
derivatives
involves
market
and
credit
risk.
The
market
risk
of
derivatives
stems
principally
from
the
potential
for
changes in
the value
of derivative
contracts based
on changes
in interest
rates. The
credit risk
of derivatives
arises from
the potential
for
default of
the counterparty.
To
manage
this credit
risk, the
Corporation
deals with
counterparties
that it
considers
to be
of good
credit
standing,
enters
into
master
netting
agreements
whenever
possible
and,
when
appropriate,
obtains
collateral.
Master
netting
agreements
incorporate
rights
of
set-off
that
provide
for
the
net
settlement
of
contracts
with
the
same
counterparty
in
the
event
of
default.
Credit Risk
Management
First BanCorp.
is subject to credit
risk mainly with
respect to its portfolio
of loans receivable
and off-balance-sheet
instruments,
mainly
loan commitments.
Loans receivable
represents loans
that First BanCorp.
holds for investment
and, therefore,
First BanCorp. is at risk for
the term of the loan. Loan commitments represent commitments
to extend credit, subject to specific conditions,
for specific amounts and
maturities. These commitments
may expose the Corporation to credit risk and are subject
to the same review and approval process as for
loans made by
the Bank. See
“Liquidity Risk and Capital Adequacy” above for
further details. The Corporation manages its credit risk
through its
credit policy,
underwriting,
independent
loan review
and quality
control
procedures,
statistical
analysis,
comprehensive
financial
analysis,
and
established
management
committees.
The
Corporation
also
employs
proactive
collection
and
loss
mitigation
efforts.
Furthermore, personnel
performing structured
loan workout functions are responsible
for mitigating defaults and minimizing
losses upon
default
within
each
region
and
for
each
business
segment. In
the
case
of
the
commercial and
industrial, commercial
mortgage and
construction
loan portfolios,
the Special Asset
Group (“SAG”)
focuses on strategies
for the accelerated
reduction of
non-performing
assets
through note
sales, short sales,
loss mitigation programs,
and sales of OREO. In addition to the management
of the resolution process
for
problem loans, the SAG oversees collection
efforts for all loans to prevent migration to the nonaccrual and/or adversely
classified status.
The SAG
utilizes
relationship
officers,
collection
specialists
and attorneys.
The Corporation
may also
have risk
of default
in the securities
portfolio.
The securities
held
by the Corporation
are principally
fixed-rate
U.S. agencies MBS and U.S. Treasury and agencies securities.
Thus, a substantial portion
of these instruments is backed
by mortgages, a
guarantee
of a U.S.
GSE or the
full faith
and credit
of the U.S.
government.
Management, consisting of the
Corporation’s Commercial Credit Risk
Officer, Retail
Credit Risk Officer,
Chief Credit Officer,
and
other senior executives, has the primary responsibility
for setting strategies to achieve the Corporation’s credit risk goals and objectives.
Management
has documented
these goals
and objectives
in the
Corporation’s
Credit Policy.
Allowance
for Credit
Losses and
Non-performing
Assets
Allowance
for Credit
Losses
for Loans
and Finance
Leases
The ACL
for loans
and finance
leases represents
the estimate
of the
level of
reserves appropriate
to absorb
expected credit
losses
over the estimated life of
the loans. The amount of the allowance
is determined using relevant available
information, from internal and
external sources, relating
to past events, current
conditions, and reasonable
and supportable forecasts.
Historical credit loss experience
is
a
significant
input
for
the
estimation
of
expected
credit
losses,
as
well
as
adjustments
to
historical
loss
information
made
for
differences in current loan-specific
risk characteristics, such as differences
in underwriting standards, portfolio mix,
delinquency level,
or
term.
Additionally,
the
Corporation’s
assessment
involves
evaluating
key
factors,
which
include
credit
and
macroeconomic
indicators,
such as
changes in
unemployment
rates, property
values, and
other relevant
factors to
account for
current and
forecasted
market conditions
that are
likely to
cause estimated
credit losses over
the life
of the
loans to differ
from historical
credit losses.
Such
factors are
subject to
regular review
and may
change to
reflect updated
performance trends
and expectations,
particularly in
times of
severe stress. The
process includes judgments
and quantitative elements
that may be
subject to significant
change. The ACL
for loans
and finance leases is reviewed at least on a quarterly basis as part of the Corporation’s
continued evaluation of its asset quality.
As
of
December
31,
2021,
the
ACL
for
loans
and
finance
leases
was
$269.0
million,
down
$116.9
million
from
December
31,
2020.
The
decrease
in
the
ACL
for
loans
and
finance
leases
primarily
reflects
an
improvement
in
the
outlook
of
macroeconomic
variables to
which the
reserve is
correlated,
as well
as charge-offs
taken against
the previously-established
$20.9 million
reserve for
residential
mortgage
nonaccrual
loans
sold
in
the
third
quarter
of
2021.
Refer
to
Note
-
Nature
of
Business
and
Summary
of
Significant Accounting Policies, in the audited consolidated financial
statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-
K, for additional information for description of the methodologies used
by the Corporation to determine the ACL.
The ratio
of the
ACL for
loans and
finance leases
to total
loans held
for investment
decreased to
2.43% as
of December
31, 2021,
compared to
3.28% as
of December
31, 2020.
On a
non-GAAP basis,
excluding SBA
PPP loans,
the ratio
of the
ACL for
loans and
finance leases to adjusted total
loans held for investment was 2.46%
as of December 31, 2021, compared
to 3.39% as of December 31,
2020.
For
the
definition
and
reconciliation
of
this
non-GAAP
financial
measure,
refer
to
the
discussion
in
“Basis
of
Presentation”
below. An explanation
of the change for each portfolio follows:
●
The
ACL
to
total
loans
ratio
for
the
residential
mortgage
portfolio
decreased
from
3.42%
as
of
December
31,
to
2.51% as of
December 31, 2021.
The reduction is mainly
related to the bulk
sale of residential mortgage
nonaccrual in the
third quarter, as well as reductions related to
the improvement in the outlook of macroeconomic variables.
●
The
ACL to
total
loans
ratio
for
the
commercial
mortgage
portfolio
decreased
from
4.90% as
of
December
31,
to
2.43%
as of December 31, 2021,
primarily reflecting an improvement
in the outlook of macroeconomic
variables to which
the
reserve
is
correlated,
including
improvements
in
the
commercial
real
estate
price
index
and
unemployment
rate
forecasts.
●
The ACL to total
loans ratio for the
commercial and industrial portfolio
increased slightly from 1.18%
as of December 31,
to
1.19%
as
of
December
31,
2021.
On
a
non-GAAP
basis,
excluding
SBA
PPP
loans,
the
ratio
of
the
ACL
for
commercial
and
industrial
loans
to
adjusted
total
commercial
and
industrial
loans
held
for
investment
was
1.25%
as
of
December 31, 2021, compared
to 1.36% as of December
31, 2020, primarily reflecting the
effect of an improvement
in the
outlook
of
macroeconomic
variables
to
which
the
reserve
is
correlated,
including
improvements
in
unemployment
rate
forecasts and overall continued growth of gross domestic product
in the U.S. mainland.
●
The ACL
to total
loans ratio
for the
construction loan
portfolio increased
from 2.53%
as of
December 31,
2020 to
2.91%
as
of
December
31,
2021,
primarily
reflecting
the
effect
of
updated
borrowers’
financial
metrics,
partially
offset
by
the
release of the
reserve previously-established
for the $6.0
million nonaccrual construction
loan repaid in
the first quarter
of
2021.
●
The ACL to
total loans ratio
for the consumer
loan portfolio decreased
from 4.33% as
of December
31, 2020
to 3.57% as
of
December
31,
2021,
primarily
related
to
improvements
in
macroeconomic
variables,
as
well
as
the
shift
in
the
composition
of
this
portfolio
that
experienced
increases
in auto
loans
and
finance
leases
and
reductions
in
personal
and
small loan portfolios that carried a higher ACL coverage.
The ratio
of the
total ACL
for loans
and finance
leases to
nonaccrual
loans held
for investment
was 242.99%
as of
December 31,
2021, compared to 188.16% as of December 31, 2020.
Substantially all of
the Corporation’s
loan portfolio is
located within the
boundaries of the
U.S. economy.
Whether the collateral
is
located in
Puerto Rico,
the U.S.
and British
Virgin
Islands, or
the U.S.
mainland (mainly
in the
state of
Florida), the
performance of
the Corporation’s
loan portfolio and
the value of
the collateral supporting
the transactions are
dependent upon the
performance of and
conditions
within each
specific area’s
real estate
market. The
Corporation believes
it sets
adequate loan-to-value
ratios following
its
regulatory and credit policy standards.
As shown
in the
following
table, the
ACL for
loans and
finance leases
amounted
to $269.0
million as
of December
31,
2021, or
2.43% of
total loans,
compared with
$385.9 million,
or 3.28%
of total
loans, as
of December
31, 2020.

Allowance
for Credit
Losses for
Unfunded
Loan Commitments
The Corporation
estimates
expected
credit losses
over the
contractual
period in
which the
Corporation
is exposed
to credit
risk as a
result
of a contractual obligation to extend credit, such as pursuant to unfunded loan commitments
and standby letters of credit for commercial
and
construction loans, unless
the
obligation is
unconditionally cancellable by
the
Corporation. The
ACL
for
off-balance sheet
credit
exposures is
adjusted as a
provision
for credit loss
expense. As
of December 31,
2021, the ACL for
off-balance
sheet credit
exposures was
$1.5
million, down
$3.6
million from
$5.1
million as
of
December 31,
2020.
The
decrease was
mainly
related to
improvements in
forecasted
macroeconomic
variables.
Allowance for Credit Losses for Held-to-Maturity
Debt Securities
As of December
31, 2021, the
held-to-maturity
securities
portfolio
consisted
of Puerto Rico
municipal
bonds. As of
December 31,
2021,
the ACL for
held-to-maturity
debt securities
was $8.6
million,
down $0.2
million from
$8.8 million
as of December
31, 2020.
The decrease
was mainly
related to
improvements in forecasted macroeconomic variables and the
repayment of certain
bonds during 2021,
partially
offset by
increases
related
to changes
in some
issuers’
financial
metrics
based on
their most
recent financial
statements.
Allowance
for Credit
Losses for
Available-for-Sale
Debt Securities
As of December 31, 2021, the
ACL for available-for-sale debt securities
was $1.1 million, down $0.2 million from $1.3 million as of
December
31, 2020.
Nonaccrual Loans and Non-performing Assets
Total
non-performing assets
consist of
nonaccrual loans
(generally loans
held
for
investment or
loans
held
for
sale
on
which
the
recognition
of interest
income was
discontinued
when the
loan became
90 days past
due or earlier
if the full
and timely
collection
of interest
or principal
is uncertain),
foreclosed
real estate and
other repossessed
properties,
and non-performing
investment
securities,
if any. When a
loan is placed in
nonaccrual status, any interest previously
recognized and not collected is reversed and charged against interest income.
Cash payments received
are recognized when
collected in accordance
with the contractual
terms of the loans. The principal
portion of the
payment is used to
reduce the principal balance of the loan, whereas the
interest portion is recognized on a cash basis
(when collected).
However,
when
management believes
that
the
ultimate
collectability of
principal is
in
doubt,
the
interest
portion
is
applied
to
the
outstanding principal.
The risk exposure of this portfolio is diversified as to individual borrowers and industries, among other factors.
In
addition,
a large portion
is secured
with real
estate collateral.
Nonaccrual Loans Policy
Residential Real Estate Loans
- The Corporation generally classifies real estate loans in
nonaccrual status when it has not received
interest and principal for a period of 90 days or more.
Commercial
and
Construction
Loans
-
The
Corporation
classifies
commercial
loans
(including
commercial
real
estate
and
construction loans) in nonaccrual
status when it has not
received interest and principal
for a period of 90
days or more or when
it does
not expect to collect all of the principal or interest due to deterioration in the financial
condition of the borrower.
Finance Leases
- The Corporation
classifies finance leases
in nonaccrual status
when it has not
received interest and
principal for
a period of 90 days or more.
Consumer Loans
- The Corporation
classifies consumer
loans in nonaccrual
status when it
has not received
interest and
principal
for a period of 90 days or more. Credit card loans continue to accrue finance
charges and fees until charged-off at 180
days delinquent.
Purchased Credit
Deteriorated Loans
- For PCD loans
the nonaccrual status
is determined in
the same manner
as for other loans,
except for PCD loans that
prior to the adoption of
CECL were classified as purchased
credit impaired (“PCI”) loans
and accounted for
under
ASC Subtopic
310-30, “Receivables
- Loans
and Debt
Securities Acquired
with Deteriorated
Credit Quality”
(ASC Subtopic
310-30). As allowed by CECL,
the Corporation elected to maintain
pools of loans accounted for under
ASC Subtopic 310-30 as “units
of
accounts,”
conceptually
treating
each
pool
as
a
single
asset.
Regarding
interest
income
recognition,
the
prospective
transition
approach
for
PCD
loans
was
applied
at
a
pool
level
which
froze
the
effective
interest
rate
of
the
pools
as
of
January
1,
2020.
According
to
regulatory
guidance,
the
determination
of
nonaccrual
or
accrual
status
for
PCD
loans
with
respect
to
which
the
Corporation
has
made
a
policy
election
to
maintain
previously
existing
pools
upon
adoption
of
CECL
should
be
made
at
the
pool
level,
not
the
individual
asset
level.
In
addition,
the
guidance
provides
that
the
Corporation
can
continue
accruing
interest
and
not
report
the PCD
loans as
being
in nonaccrual
status if
the following
criteria
are met:
(i) the
Corporation
can reasonably
estimate the
timing and amounts of
cash flows expected to
be collected, and (ii)
the Corporation did not
acquire the asset primarily
for the rewards
of ownership
of the
underlying collateral,
such as
the use
in operations
or improving
the collateral
for resale.
Thus, the
Corporation
continues to exclude these pools of PCD loans from nonaccrual loan statistics.
Other Real Estate Owned
OREO acquired
in settlement of
loans is carried
at fair value
less estimated costs
to sell off
the real estate.
Appraisals are obtained
periodically, generally
on an annual basis.
Other Repossessed Property
The
other
repossessed
property
category
generally
included
repossessed
boats
and
autos
acquired
in
settlement
of
loans.
Repossessed boats and autos are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair
value.
Other Non-Performing Assets
This
category
consisted
of a
residential
pass-through
MBS
issued
by
the
PRHFA placed
in
non-performing
status
in
the
second
quarter of 2021 based on the delinquency status of the underlying second
mortgage loans.
Loans Past-Due 90 Days and Still Accruing
These are accruing loans
that are contractually delinquent
90 days or more. These
past-due loans are either
current as to interest but
delinquent
as to
the payment
of
principal
or are
insured
or guaranteed
under
applicable FHA,
VA
,
or
other
government-guaranteed
programs for residential mortgage loans. Furthermore,
as required by instructions in regulatory reports, loans past due
90 days and still
accruing
include
loans
previously
pooled
into
GNMA
securities
for
which
the
Corporation
has
the
option
but
not
the
obligation
to
repurchase loans
that meet
GNMA’s
specified delinquency
criteria (
e.g.
, borrowers
fails to
make any
payment for
three consecutive
months).
For accounting
purposes, these
GNMA loans
subject to
the repurchase
option are
required to
be reflected
on the
financial
statements with an offsetting liability.
TDRs are
classified
as either
accrual
or nonaccrual
loans. A
loan
on nonaccrual
status and
restructured
as a
TDR will
remain
on
nonaccrual
status until
the borrower
has proven
the ability
to perform
under the
modified structure,
generally
for a
minimum
of six
months,
and there
is evidence
that
such payments
can and
are
likely
to continue
as agreed.
The Corporation
considers performance
prior to the restructuring, or significant events that coincide with the
restructuring, in assessing whether the borrower can meet the new
terms,
which
may
result
in
the
loan
being
returned
to
accrual
status
at
the
time
of
the
restructuring
or
after
a
shorter
performance
period. If
the borrower’s
ability to
meet the
revised payment
schedule is
uncertain, the
loan remains
classified as
a nonaccrual
loan.
For a discussion of permissible
loan modifications under the
amended CARES Act of 2020
for loans otherwise eligible for
TDR, refer

$13.8 million),
nonaccrual construction loans
totaling $33.0 million (net
of fair value write-downs
of $6.7 million) and
nonaccrual commercial and
industrial loans totaling $1.8
million (net of fair
value write-downs of $1.7 million). These loans were eventually
sold or paid in full during 2019 and 2018.

Excludes PCD loans
previously accounted for
under ASC Subtopic
310-30 for which
the Corporation made
the accounting policy
election of maintaining
pools of loans
accounted
for under ASC
Subtopic 310-30
as “units of
account” both at
the time of
adoption of
CECL on January
1, 2020 and
on an ongoing
basis for credit
loss measurement.
These loans
accrete interest
income based
on the
effective interest
rate of
the loan
pools determined
at the
time of
adoption of
CECL and
will continue
to be
excluded from
nonaccrual loan
statistics as long as
the Corporation can reasonably
estimate the timing and
amount of cash flows
expected to be collected
on the loan pools.
The amortized cost of
such loans as of
December 31, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017 amounted to $117.5
million, $130.9 million, $136.7 million, $146.6
million and $158.2 million, respectively.
(4)
Nonaccrual loans exclude
$363.4 million, $393.3
million, $398.3 million,
$478.9 million and
$374.7 million of
TDR loans that
were in compliance
with the modified
terms and in
accrual status as of December 31, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018
and 2017, respectively.
(5)
It is
the Corporation's
policy to
report delinquent
residential mortgage
loans insured
by the
FHA, guaranteed
by the
VA,
and other
government-insured loans
as loans
past-due 90
days and still accruing as opposed
to nonaccrual loans since the principal repayment
is insured. The Corporation continues accruing
interest on these loans until they have
passed the
15 months delinquency mark, taking into consideration
the FHA interest curtailment process.
These balances include $46.6 million of residential
mortgage loans insured by the FHA
that were over 15 months delinquent as of December 31, 2021.
(6)
These include rebooked
loans, which were previously
pooled into GNMA securities,
amounting to $7.2
million, $10.7 million, $35.3
million, $43.6 million, and
$62.1 million as of
December 31,
2021, 2020,
2019, 2018,
and 2017,
respectively.
Under the
GNMA program,
the Corporation
has the
option but
not the
obligation to
repurchase loans
that meet
GNMA’s
specified delinquency criteria. For accounting purposes,
the loans subject to the repurchase option are required
to be reflected on the financial statements
with an offsetting
liability.

The amortized
cost of such

December 31, 2021,
2020, 2019,
2018 and 2017
amounted to $117.5 million, $130.9 million,
$136.7 million, $146.6 million and $158.2 million, respectively.
(6)
These include rebooked

During
2018,
the
Corporation
transferred
to
held
for
sale
a
$30.0
million
nonaccrual
construction
loan
in
the
Virgin
Islands
region
(net
of
a
$5.1
million
fair
value
write-down).
The
construction loans transferred to held for sale was eventually
sold during the fourth quarter of 2018.
Total
nonaccrual
loans
were
$110.7
million
as
of
December
31,
2021.
This
represents
a
decrease
of
$94.4
million
from
$205.1
million as
of December
31, 2020.
The decrease
was primarily
related to
a $70.2
million reduction
in nonaccrual
residential mortgage
loans,
driven
by the
bulk
sale of
$52.5
million
of
nonaccrual residential
mortgage
loans
during
the
third
quarter
of
2021 as
further
described
below.
In
addition,
there
was
an
$18.3
million
decrease
in
nonaccrual
commercial
and
construction
nonaccrual
loans,
including through the repayment of
a $6.0 million construction loan relationship
in the Virgin
Islands region, the sale of a
$3.1 million
construction
loans
in
the
Puerto
Rico
region,
and
other
large
repayments
as
explained
below,
and
a
$5.8
million
decrease
in
nonaccrual consumer loans.
Nonaccrual commercial
mortgage loans decreased
by $4.3 million
to $25.3 million
as of December
31, 2021 from
$29.6 million as
of
December
31,
2020.
The
decrease
was
primarily
related
to
collections
of
approximately
$4.3
million
during
2021,
including
the
payoff of
two commercial mortgage
loan in the
Puerto Rico region
amounting to $2.4
million, charge-offs
and the transfer
of loans to
OREO,
partially
offset
by
inflows.
Total
inflows
of
nonaccrual
commercial
mortgage
loans
were
$5.1
million
for
the
year
ended
December 31, 2021, compared to $1.9 million for 2020.
Nonaccrual
commercial
and
industrial
loans
decreased
by
$3.8
million
to
$17.1
million
as
of
December
31,
from
$20.9
million as of December 31, 2020. The decrease was mainly
related to collections of approximately $6.5 million during
2021, including
a paydown that reduced
by $1.4 million the carrying
value of a nonaccrual
commercial and industrial loan
in the Puerto Rico region, a
$1.2 million nonaccrual commercial and industrial
loan paid off in the Puerto Rico region,
and the transfer of loans to OREO, partially
offset
by
inflows.
Total
inflows of
nonaccrual
commercial
and
industrial
loans
were
$4.4
million
for
the
year
ended December
31,
2021, compared to $11.4 million for 2020.
Nonaccrual construction
loans decreased
by $10.3
million to
$2.7 million
as of
December 31,
2021, compared
to $13.0
million as
of
December
31,
2020.
The
decrease
was
primarily
related
to
the
aforementioned
$6.0
million
repayment
of
a
construction
loan
relationship in the Virgin
Islands region and the sale of a $3.1 million loan in the Puerto Rico region.

restored to accrual status, as
well as collections, including
the repayment of two large
nonaccrual residential
mortgage
loans totaling
$3.9 million,
partially
offset
by
inflows. The
inflows
of nonaccrual
residential
mortgage
loans during
were $33.5 million, a decrease of $0.2 million, compared to inflows of $33.7 million
for 2020.
During
the
third
quarter
of
2021,
the
Corporation
sold
$52.5
million
of
non-performing
residential
mortgage
loans
and
related
servicing
advances
of
$2.0
million.
The
Corporation
received
$31.5
million,
or
58%
of
book
value
before
reserves,
for
the
$54.5
million
of non
-performing
loans and
related
servicing
advances.
Approximately
$20.9
million
of reserves
had
been allocated
to
the
loans
sold.
The
transaction
resulted
in
total
net
charge-offs
of
$23.1
million
and
an
additional
loss
of
approximately
$2.1
million
recorded
as
a
charge
to
the
provision
for
credit
losses
in
the
third
quarter. The
Corporation's
primary
goal
with
respect
to
this
transaction was to accelerate the disposition of non-performing
assets.

The amount
of nonaccrual
consumer loans,
including finance
leases, decreased
by $5.8
million to
$10.5
million as
December 31,
2021, compared to
$16.2 million as
of December 31,
2020. The decrease
was primarily in
auto loans, small
loans, and finance
leases,
driven by
collections and
charge-offs recorded
in 2021,
partially offset
by inflows.
The inflows
of nonaccrual
consumer loans
during
the year ended December 31, 2021
amounted to $37.6 million compared to inflows of $42.1 million in 2020.
As of
December
31,
2021,
approximately
$23.8
million
of the
loans
placed
in nonaccrual
status,
mainly
commercial
loans, were
current,
or
had
delinquencies
of
less
than
days
in
their
interest
payments,
including
$13.5
million
of
TDRs
maintained
in
nonaccrual
status
until
the
restructured
loans
meet
the
criteria
of
sustained
payment
performance
under
the
revised
terms
for
reinstatement to
accrual status
and there
is no
doubt about
full collectability.
Collections on
these loans
are being
recorded on
a cash
basis through earnings, or on a cost-recovery basis, as conditions warrant.
During
the
year
ended
December
31,
2021,
interest
income
of
approximately
$2.3
million
related
to
nonaccrual
loans
with
a
carrying value
of $37.3
million as
of December
31, 2021, mainly
nonaccrual construction
and commercial
loans, was applied
against
the related principal balances under the cost-recovery method.
Total
loans
in
early
delinquency
(
i.e.
, 30-89
days
past
due
loans,
as defined
in
regulatory
report
instructions)
amounted
to
$90.3
million as of December 31,
2021, a decrease of $58.5
million compared to $148.8 million
as of December 31, 2020.
The variances by
major portfolio categories follow:
●
Residential mortgage
loans in
early delinquency
decreased by
$32.3 million
to $34.2
million as
of December
31, 2021,
and
consumer
loans
in
early
delinquency
decreased
by
$6.3
million
to
$49.4
million
as
of
December
31,
2021.
The
decreases
reflect
the
combination
of
loans
brought
current
during
the
year
ended
December
31,
and
loans
that
migrated
to
nonaccrual status.
●
Commercial and construction loans in early delinquency decreased
by $19.2
million to $6.7 million as of December 31, 2021,
the decrease was primarily related to the refinancing of two matured
commercial loans.
In addition,
the Corporation provides
homeownership preservation
assistance to its
customers through
a loss mitigation
program in
Puerto Rico. Depending
upon the nature
of borrower’s
financial condition,
restructurings or loan
modifications through
this program,
as
well
as
other
restructurings
of
individual
commercial,
commercial
mortgage,
construction,
and
residential
mortgage
loans
fit
the
definition of
a TDR.
A restructuring
of a
debt constitutes
a TDR
if the
creditor,
for economic
or legal
reasons related
to the
debtor’s
financial difficulties,
grants a
concession to
the debtor
that it
would not
otherwise consider.
Modifications involve
changes in
one or
more of
the loan
terms that
bring a
defaulted loan
current and
provide sustainable
affordability.
Changes may
include, among
others,
the extension
of the
maturity of
the loan
and modifications
of the
loan rate.
See Note
8 -
Loans Held
for Investment,
to the
audited
consolidated
financial
statements
included
in
Item
of
this
Annual
Report
on
Form
10-K,
for
additional
information
and
statistics
about the Corporation’s TDR loans.
TDR
loans
are
classified
as
either
accrual
or
nonaccrual
loans.
Loans
in
accrual
status
may
remain
in
accrual
status
when
their
contractual terms
have been
modified in
a TDR
if the
loans had
demonstrated performance
prior to
the restructuring
and payment
in
full
under
the
restructured
terms
is
expected.
Otherwise,
a
loan
on
nonaccrual
status
and
restructured
as
a
TDR
will
remain
on
nonaccrual
status until
the borrower
has proven
the ability
to perform
under the
modified structure,
generally
for a
minimum
of six
months, and
there is evidence
that such payments
can, and are
likely to, continue
as agreed. Performance
prior to the
restructuring, or
significant events that coincide with the restructuring,
are included in assessing whether the borrower can meet
the new terms and may
result
in
the
loan
being
returned
to
accrual
status
at
the
time
of
the
restructuring
or
after
a
shorter
performance
period.
If
the
borrower’s
ability
to
meet
the
revised
payment
schedule
is
uncertain,
the
loan
remains
classified
as
a
nonaccrual
loan.
Loan
modifications
increase the
Corporation’s
interest income
by returning
a nonaccrual
loan to
performing
status, if
applicable,
increase
cash flows by providing for payments to be made by the borrower,
and limit increases in foreclosure and OREO costs.

Under the provisions
of the CARES
Act of 2020,
as amended by
the Consolidated Appropriations
Act, 2021 enacted
on December
27, 2020,
financial institutions
may permit
loan modifications
for borrowers
affected by
the COVID-19
pandemic through
January 1,
without categorizing
the modifications
as TDRs, as
long as the
loans meet certain
conditions, including
the requirement that
the
loan
was
not
more
than
days
past

arrangements
established
in
to
assist borrowers
affected by
the COVID-19
pandemic, as
of December

all loans
previously modified
under such
programs
have completed their deferral period.

Operational Risk
The
Corporation
faces
ongoing
and
emerging
risk
and
regulatory
pressure
related
to
the
activities
that
surround
the
delivery
of
banking
and
financial
products.
Coupled
with
external
influences,
such
as
market
conditions,
security
risks,
and
legal
risks,
the
potential for
operational and
reputational loss
has increased.
To
mitigate and
control operational
risk, the
Corporation has
developed,
and continues to
enhance, specific internal
controls, policies, and procedures
that are designed to
identify and manage operational
risk
at
appropriate
levels
throughout
the
organization.
The
purpose
of
these
mechanisms
is
to
provide
reasonable
assurance
that
the
Corporation’s business operations
are functioning within the policies and limits established by management.
The
Corporation
classifies operational
risk
into
two
major
categories:
business-specific
and
corporate-wide
affecting
all business
lines.
For
business
specific
risks,
a
risk
assessment
group
works
with
the
various
business
units
to
ensure
consistency
in
policies,
processes
and
assessments.
With
respect
to
corporate-wide
risks,
such
as
information
security,
business
recovery,
and
legal
and
compliance, the
Corporation has specialized
groups, such
as the Legal
Department, Information
Security,
Corporate Compliance,
and
Operations. These groups
assist the lines of
business in the
development and implementation
of risk management
practices specific to
the needs of the business groups.
Legal and Compliance Risk
Legal and compliance risk includes
the risk of noncompliance with applicable
legal and regulatory requirements, the
risk of adverse
legal
judgments
against
the
Corporation,
and
the
risk
that
a
counterparty’s
performance
obligations
will
be
unenforceable.
The
Corporation
is
subject
to
extensive
regulation
in
the
different
jurisdictions
in
which
it
conducts
its
business,
and
this
regulatory
scrutiny has
been significantly
increasing over
the years.
The Corporation
has established,
and continues
to enhance,
procedures that
are designed
to ensure
compliance with
all applicable
statutory,
regulatory
and any
other legal
requirements.
The Corporation
has a
Compliance
Director
who
reports
to
the
Chief
Risk
Officer
and
is
responsible
for
the
oversight
of
regulatory
compliance
and
implementation
of an
enterprise-wide compliance
risk assessment
process.
The Compliance
division
has officer
roles in
each major
business area with direct reporting responsibilities to the Corporate Compliance
Group.
Concentration Risk
The Corporation conducts
its operations in
a geographically concentrated
area, as its main
market is Puerto
Rico. Of the total
gross
loan portfolio
held for investment
of $11.1
billion as of
December 31, 2021,
the Corporation had
credit risk of
approximately 79%
in
the Puerto Rico region, 18% in the United States region, and 3% in the Virgin
Islands region.
Update on the Puerto Rico Fiscal Situation
A significant
portion
of the
Corporation’s
business activities
and credit
exposure
is concentrated
in the
Commonwealth of
Puerto
Rico, which has experienced an economic and fiscal crisis for more
than a decade.
Economic Indicators
According to
the latest
revised estimates
published by
the Puerto
Rico Planning
Board (“PRPB”)
in July
2021, Puerto
Rico’s
real
gross national product
(“GNP”) grew by 1.8%
during fiscal year
2019 (previously at
1.5%). Also, the
PRPB published its
preliminary
real
GNP
estimate
for
fiscal
year
2020,
suggesting
that
the
Puerto
Rico
economy
contracted
by
3.2%.
According
to the
PRPB,
the
economic
growth
seen
during fiscal
year
primarily
reflects the
economic
stimulus generated
by
the
influx of
federal
recovery
funds in response to
the natural disasters that affected
Puerto Rico in September
2017, while the contraction
experienced in fiscal year
2020 was primarily driven by the adverse impact of the COVID-19
pandemic and the related mandatory restrictions.
Fiscal Plan
On
January
27,
2022,
the
PROMESA
oversight
board
certified
the
Fiscal
Plan
for
Puerto
Rico.
Similar
to
previous
fiscal
plans,
the
Fiscal
Plan
incorporates
updated
information
related
to
the
macroeconomic
environment,
as
well
as
government
revenues,
expenditures,
structural
reform
efforts,
and
recent
increases
in
federal
funding.
More
importantly,
the
Fiscal
Plan
reflects the Commonwealth
Plan of Adjustment
recently confirmed by
the U.S. District Court
for the District
of Puerto Rico.
Relative
to the
previous
fiscal plan,
the 2022
Fiscal Plan
incorporates a
new set
of expenditure
projections that
factor in
the now-established
debt
service
requirements
pursuant
to
the
Plan of
Adjustment,
as well
as additional
investments
enabled
by the
increased resources
available
to
the
government.
The
Fiscal
Plan
prioritizes
resource
allocations
across
three
major
themes:
(i)
investing
in
the
operational capacity of
the government to deliver
services with Civil Service
Reform, (ii) prioritizing
obligations to current
and future
retirees, and (iii) creating a fiscally responsible post-bankruptcy government.
The
Fiscal
Plan
contains
an
updated
macroeconomic
forecast
that
reflects
the
adverse
impact
of
the
pandemic-induced
recession at
the end of
fiscal year
2020, followed
by a
forecasted rebound
and recovery
in fiscal years
2021 through
2023. Similar
to
the
previous
fiscal
plan,
the
Fiscal
Plan
incorporates
a
real
growth
series
that
was
adjusted
for
the
short-term
income
effects
resulting
from
the
extraordinary
unemployment
insurance
and
other
pandemic-related
direct
transfer
programs.
Specifically,
the
revised fiscal plan
estimates that Puerto
Rico’s GNP
will grow by
5.2% in the
current fiscal year
2022, followed by
a 0.6% growth
in
fiscal year
2023.
Excluding
the effect
on household
income from
the unprecedented
pandemic-related
federal government
stimulus,
the 2022 Fiscal Plan estimates that real GNP growth would be 2.6% and 0.9% in
fiscal years 2022 and 2023, respectively.
Over the
past few
years, Puerto
Rico has
received an
infusion of
historical levels
of federal
support, creating
new opportunities
to
address
high
priority
needs.
The
Fiscal
Plan
projects
that
approximately
$84
billion
of
disaster
relief
funding
in
total,
from
federal and
private sources,
will be disbursed
in the reconstruction
process over a
period of 18
years (2018 to
2035). Moreover,
since
the previous
fiscal plan
was certified
in 2021,
the Commonwealth’s
available resources
have significantly
increased principally
as a
result
of
two
major
developments:
(i)
incremental
federal
funding
for
health
care
as
a
result
of
the
recent
guidance
issued
by
the
Centers for
Medicare and
Medicaid Services
(“CMS”), which
increases the
federal funding
cap by
over $2
billion per
year,
and (ii)
improved local
revenue collections
as a
result of
a better-than-expected
recovery,
increased local
consumption and
economic activity
enabled by
enhanced income
support programs
(e.g. incremental
funding of
approximately $460
million for
the Nutrition
Assistance
Program). The 2022
Fiscal Plan provides
a roadmap to take
maximum advantage of
this unique opportunity,
create an environment
of
fiscal stability,
and develop the
conditions for long-term
growth and
economic development.
Nonetheless, the fiscal
plan continues to
underline the need to implement structural reforms to maximize the positive
impact of federal recovery funds.
Debt Restructuring
After more
than four years
since the
Commonwealth entered
Title III,
on January
18, 2022,
the U.S.
District Court
for the
District
of
Puerto
Rico
(the
“Court”)
issued
an
order
to
confirm
the PoA
to
restructure
approximately
$35
billion
of
debt
and
other
claims
against the
Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico,
the PBA,
and the
ERS; and
more than
$50 billion
of pension
liabilities. According
to the
PROMESA
oversight
board,
the
Plan
of
Adjustment
provides
a
one-time
cash
payment
to
creditors,
as
well
as
the
issuance
of
approximately $7.4
billion in new
debt and
contingent value
instruments (“CVIs”),
among other
items. In
addition, the PoA
provides
certain
Commonwealth
employees
with
various
benefits.
Confirmation
of
the
PoA
marks
a
major
milestone
in
the
overall
debt
restructuring process and creates a foundation for Puerto Rico’s
recovery and economic growth.
Key pending debt restructurings include
the PREPA,
for which the PROMESA oversight board
said in a status report filed with
the
Court
on
January
19,
2021,
that
it
intends
to
move
forward
with
the
settlement
set
forth
in
the
Restructuring
Support
Agreement
(“RSA”)
and
will
continue
efforts
to
propose
a
plan
of
adjustment
for
PREPA
by
the
end
of
March
2022;
however,
such
date
is
dependent
on
certain
factors
outside
the
government
parties’
control
that
might
push
the
filing
of
a
plan
into
the
second
quarter
of
2022.
Exposure to the Puerto Rico Government
As of December
31, 2021, the Corporation
had $360.1 million of
direct exposure to
the Puerto Rico government,
its municipalities,
and
public
corporations,
compared
to
$394.8
million
as
of
December
31,
2020.
As
of
December
31,
2021,
approximately
$187.8
million of the
exposure consisted of loans
and obligations of municipalities
in Puerto Rico that
are supported by assigned
property tax
revenues
and
for
which,
in
most
cases,
the
good
faith,
credit
and
unlimited
taxing
power
of
the
applicable
municipality
have
been
pledged to
their repayment,
and $122.8
million consisted
of municipal
revenue and
special obligation
bonds.
Approximately 61%
of
the Corporation’s
exposure to
Puerto Rico’s
government consisted
primarily of
senior priority
obligations concentrated
in four
of the
largest
municipalities
in
Puerto
Rico.
The
municipalities
are
required
by
law
to
levy
special
property
taxes
in
such
amounts
as
are
required for the payment
of all of their respective
general obligation bonds
and notes. Furthermore, municipalities
are also likely to be
affected
by
the
negative
economic
and
other
effects
resulting
from
the
COVID-19
pandemic,
as
well
as
expense,
revenue,
or
cash
management measures
taken to
address the
Puerto Rico
government’s
fiscal problems
and measures
included in
fiscal plans
of other
government
entities.
In
addition
to
municipalities,
the
total
direct
exposure
also
included
$12.5
million
in
loans
to
an
affiliate
of
PREPA,
$33.4 million
in loans
to an
agency of
the Puerto
Rico central
government,
and obligations
of the
Puerto Rico
government,
specifically a residential
pass-through MBS issued
by the PRHFA,
at an amortized
cost of $3.6 million
as part of its available-for
-sale
investment securities portfolio (fair value of $2.9 million as of December
31, 2021).
The
following

In
addition,
as
of
December
31,
2021,
the
Corporation
had
$92.8
million
in
exposure
to
residential
mortgage
loans
that
are
guaranteed by
the PRHFA,
a governmental
instrumentality that has
been designated as
a covered entity
under PROMESA (December
31,
-
$106.5 million).
Residential
mortgage
loans guaranteed
by
the
PRHFA
are
secured by
the underlying
properties
and
the
guarantees serve
to cover shortfalls
in collateral in
the event of
a borrower default.
The Puerto Rico
government guarantees
up to $75
million
of
the
principal
for
all
loans
under
the
mortgage
loan
insurance
program.
According
to
the
most
recently
released
audited
financial
statements
of
the
PRHFA,
as
of
June
30,
2019,
the
PRHFA’s
mortgage
loans
insurance
program
covered
loans
in
an
aggregate
amount
of
approximately
$557
million.
The
regulations
adopted
by
the
PRHFA
require
the
establishment
of
adequate
reserves
to
guarantee
the
solvency
of
the
mortgage
loan
insurance
fund.
As
of
June
30,
2019,
the
most
recent
date
as
to
which
information is available,
the PRHFA
was not in
compliance with the regulations
and had an unrestricted
deficit of approximately
$5.2
million in the mortgage loans insurance program.
As of December
31, 2021, the
Corporation had
$2.7 billion of
public sector deposits
in Puerto Rico,
compared to $1.8
billion as of
December
31,
2020.
Approximately
19%
of
the
public
sector
deposits
as
of
December
31,
was
from
municipalities
and
municipal
agencies
in
Puerto
Rico
and
81%
was
from
public
corporations,
the
central
government
and
agencies,
and
U.S.
federal
government agencies in Puerto Rico.
Exposure to USVI government
The Corporation has operations in the USVI and has credit exposure
to USVI government entities.
For
many
years,
the
USVI
has
been
experiencing
a
number
of
fiscal
and
economic
challenges
that
have
deteriorated
the
overall
financial and
economic conditions
in the area.
Between 2008 and
2017, the
USVI real GDP
contracted at
a compound annual
growth
rate of -4.2%. On May 26, 2021, the United States Bureau
of Economic Analysis (the “BEA”) released estimates
of GDP estimates for
the
USVI
for
2019.
According
to
the
BEA,
the
USVI’s
real
GDP
increased
2.2%
in
2019.
Also,
the
BEA
revised
the
previously
published real
GDP growth
estimate for
2018 from
1.5% to 1.6%.
Growth in
2019 was
primarily driven
by increases
in private
fixed
investment,
exports
and
consumer
spending.
These
increases
were
partially
offset
by
decreases
in
inventory
investment
and
government spending.
Private fixed investment
doubled from the
previous year,
reflecting growth in
business purchases of
equipment
and
in
construction,
including
homes.
In
addition,
disaster-related
insurance
payouts
and
federal
assistance
supported
the
reconstruction
and
major
repairs
of
businesses
and
homes
that
were
destroyed
or
heavily
damaged
by
the
two
major
hurricanes
in
September 2017.
Although economic
activity in the
USVI showed signs
of improvements during
2018 and 2019,
the economic threat
resulting
from
the
COVID-19
pandemic
is
anticipated
to
diminish
growth
throughout
and
2021.
Notwithstanding,
similar
to
Puerto Rico,
the USVI
has benefited
from the
various rounds
of economic
stimulus programs
deployed by
the Federal
Government.
Overall total pandemic-related relief funding allocated to
the USVI exceeds $1.5 billion.
On
October
28,
2021,
the U.S.
Census
Bureau
released
the 2020
Census
population
and housing
unit
count
for
the USVI.
As of
April
1,
2020,
the
USVI’s
population
was 87,146,
representing
a
18.1%
decline
from
the 2010
Census
population
of 106,405.
The
housing unit count was 57,257 in 2020, representing an increase of 2.4%
from the 2010 Census housing unit count of 55,901.
PROMESA
does
not
apply
to
the
USVI
and,
as
such,
there
is
currently
no
federal
legislation
permitting
the
restructuring
of
the
debts of
the USVI
and
its public
corporations
and instrumentalities.
To
the extent
that the
fiscal condition
of the
USVI government
continues to
deteriorate, the
U.S. Congress
or the government
of the
USVI may enact
legislation allowing
for the restructuring
of the
financial
obligations
of
the
USVI
government
entities
or
imposing
a
stay
on
creditor
remedies,
including
by
making
PROMESA
applicable to the USVI.
On
February
8,
2022,
the
Virgin
Islands
Public
Finance
Authority
(“VIPFA”)
issued
a
voluntary
notice
to
inform
that
the
Government of the
Virgin
Islands (the “GVI”)
is evaluating a refinancing
of all the outstanding
matching revenue fund revenue
bonds
issued by
the VIPFA
as part of
a broader
plan to increase
liquidity to
the GVI
in order
to provide
additional dedicated
funding to
the
Employees’
Retirement
System
of
the
Virgin
Islands.
According
to
the
VIPFA,
the
proposed
refinancing
would
be
accomplished
through
a
securitization
of
the
matching
fund
revenues,
with
the
proceeds
of
one
or
more
new
series
of
bonds
(the
“Securitization
Bonds”)
expected
to
be
issued
by
the
Matching
Fund
Special
Purpose
Securitization
Corporation
(the
“Issuer”),
a
special
purpose
vehicle
created
pursuant
to
recently
enacted
legislation.
Such
securitization,
if
pursued,
is
expected
to
include
the
repayment,
refunding or defeasance
of all of the
outstanding matching
fund revenue bonds
through the issuance
of such Securitization
Bonds and
possibly
a
cash
tender
for
the
outstanding
matching
fund
revenue
bonds
and/or
an
exchange
of
such
outstanding
matching
fund
revenue bonds for Securitization Bonds.
As
of
December
31,
2021,
the
Corporation
had
$39.2
million
in
loans
to
USVI
government
instrumentalities
and
public
corporations, compared
to $61.8
million as
of December
31, 2020.
All the
amount outstanding
as of
December 31,
2021, is
owed by
the public
corporations of
the USVI.
As of
December 31,
2021, all
loans were
currently performing
and up
to date
on principal
and
interest payments.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The Corporation
has included
in this
Form 10-K
the following
financial measures
that are
not recognized
under GAAP,
which are
referred to as non-GAAP financial measures:
1.
Net
interest
income,
interest
rate
spread,
and
net
interest
margin
excluding
the
changes
in
the
fair
value
of
derivative
instruments
and
on
a
tax-equivalent
basis
are
reported
in
order
to
provide
to
investors
additional
information
about
the
Corporation’s
net
interest
income
that
management
uses
and
believes
should
facilitate comparability
and
analysis
of
the
periods presented.
The changes in the
fair value of
derivative instruments have
no effect on
interest due or
interest earned on
interest-bearing
liabilities
or
interest-earning
assets,
respectively.
The
tax-equivalent
adjustment
to
net
interest
income
recognizes
the income
tax savings
when comparing
taxable and
tax-exempt
assets and
assumes a
marginal
income tax
rate.
Income
from tax-exempt
earning assets
is increased
by an
amount equivalent
to the
taxes that
would have
been paid
if this
income
had
been
taxable
at
statutory
rates.
Management
believes
that
it
is
a
standard
practice
in
the
banking
industry
to
present net
interest income,
interest rate spread,
and net interest
margin on
a fully tax-equivalent
basis. This
adjustment puts
all earning assets, most notab
ly tax-exempt securities and tax-exempt
loans, on a common basis that
facilitates comparison of
results to
the results
of peers.
See “Results
of Operations
- Net
Interest
Income”
above for
the table
that reconciles
the net
interest
income
calculated
and
presented
in
accordance
with
GAAP
with
the
non-GAAP
financial
measure
“net
interest
income excluding
fair value
changes and
on a tax-equivalent
basis.” The table
also reconciles
net interest
spread and
margin
calculated and
presented in
accordance with
GAAP with
the non-GAAP
financial measures
“net interest
spread and
margin
excluding fair value changes and on a tax-equivalent basis.”
2.
The
tangible
common
equity
ratio
and
tangible
book
value
per
common
share
are
non-GAAP
financial
measures
that
management believes
are generally
used by
the financial
community to
evaluate capital
adequacy.
Tangible
common equity
is
total
equity
less
preferred
equity,
goodwill,
core
deposit
intangibles,
and
other
intangibles,
such
as
the
purchased
credit
card relationship
intangible and the
insurance customer
relationship intangible.
Tangible
assets are total
assets less goodwill,
core
deposit
intangibles,
and
other
intangibles,
such
as
the
purchased
credit
card
relationship
intangible
and
the
insurance
customer
relationship
intangible.
Management
and
many
stock
analysts
use
the
tangible
common
equity
ratio
and
tangible
book
value
per
common
share
in
conjunction
with
more
traditional
bank
capital
ratios
to
compare
the
capital
adequacy
of
banking organizations with
significant amounts of goodwill
or other intangible assets,
typically stemming from
the use of the
purchase method
of accounting for
mergers and
acquisitions. Accordingly,
the Corporation
believes that
disclosures of
these
financial measures
may be
useful to
investors. Neither
tangible common
equity nor
tangible assets,
or the
related measures,
should be
considered in
isolation or
as a
substitute for
stockholders’
equity,
total assets,
or any
other measure
calculated in
accordance
with
GAAP.
Moreover,
the
manner
in
which
the
Corporation
calculates
its
tangible
common
equity,
tangible
assets, and
any other
related measures
may differ
from that
of other
companies reporting
measures with
similar names.
See
“Risk Management - Capital” above for a reconciliation of the Corporation’s
tangible common equity and tangible assets.

ACL
for
loans
and
finance
leases
to
adjusted
total
loans
held
for
investment
ratio
is
a
non-GAAP
financial
measure
that
excludes SBA PPP
loans amounting
to $145.0 million
and $406.0 million
as of December 31, 2021
and December 31,
2020,
respectively.
The SBA PPP loans
are fully-guaranteed
by the SBA, and
the principal amount
of the loans
may be forgiven
in
full
or
in
part,
thus
presenting
less credit
risk
than
a
non-SBA
PPP
loan.
Management
believes
the
use
of
this non
-GAAP
measure
provides
additional
understanding
when
assessing
the
Corporation’s
reserve
coverage
and
facilitates
comparison
with other periods. See below for
the reconciliation of the GAAP ratio
of ACL for loans and finance
leases to total loans held
for investment to the Non-GAAP ratio of the ACL for loans and finance leases to adjusted
total loans held for investment.

Adjusted
provision
for
credit losses
for
loans
and
finance
leases to
net
charge-offs
ratio is
a
non-GAAP
financial
measure
that
excludes
the
effect
related
to
the
net
loan
loss reserve
release
of
$6.4
million
and
$16.9
million
recorded
in
the years
ended December 31, 2019
and 2018, respectively,
and the $71.3 million charge
to the provision for the
year ended December
31, 2017, resulting from
revised estimates of the qualitative
reserve associated with the
effects of Hurricanes Irma
and Maria.
Management believes
that this
information helps
investors understand
the adjusted
measure without
regard to
items that
are
not expected
to reoccur
with any
regularity or
may reoccur
at uncertain
times and
in uncertain
amounts on
reported
results
and facilitates comparisons with
other periods.
See below for the reconciliation
of the GAAP ratio of
the provision for credit
losses for
loans and
finance leases
to net
charge-offs
to the
Non-GAAP
ratio of
the adjusted
provision
for credit
losses for
loans and finance leases to net charge-offs.
5.
To
supplement
the
Corporation’s
financial
statements
presented
in
accordance
with
GAAP,
the
Corporation
uses,
and
believes that investors would benefit
from disclosure of, non-GAAP financial measures
that reflect adjustments to net income
and non
-interest expenses
to exclude
items that
management
identifies as
Special Items
because management
believes they
are not
reflective of
core operating
performance, are
not expected
to reoccur with
any regularity or
may reoccur
at uncertain
times
and
in
uncertain
amounts.
This
Form
10-K
includes
the
following
non-GAAP
financial
measures
for
the
year
ended
December 31, 2021 and 2020 that reflect the described items that were excluded
for one of those reasons.
Adjusted net income reflects the effect of the following
exclusions:

tax rate of 37.5%).
−
Tax
benefit
of
$1.1
million
and
$2.0
million
in

realized
on
the
repurchase
of
TRuPs
in
recorded

Management
believes that
the presentation

adjusted non-interest
expenses
and
adjustments to
the various

and the
ratio
of adjusted
provision for
credit losses
for loans

the ability
of analysts
and investors
to
analyze
trends
in
the
