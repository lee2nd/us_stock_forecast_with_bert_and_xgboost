ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
(Amounts in tables in thousands of dollars, except for per share data)
Executive Overview
The following discussion of Results of Operations includes certain non-GAAP financial data and measures such as adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and adjusted earnings per share amounts which exclude non-cash pension settlement charges in 2021 and 2020. Management utilizes these adjusted financial data and measures to assess comparative operations against those of prior periods without the distortion of non-comparable factors. The Gorman-Rupp Company believes that these non-GAAP financial data and measures also will be useful to investors in assessing the strength of the Company’s underlying operations from period to period. Provided below is a reconciliation of adjusted earnings per share amounts and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
The Gorman-Rupp Company (“we”, “our”, “Gorman-Rupp” or the “Company”) is a leading designer, manufacturer and international marketer of pumps and pump systems for use in diverse water, wastewater, construction, dewatering, industrial, petroleum, original equipment, agriculture, fire protection, heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC), military and other liquid-handling applications. The Company attributes its success to long-term product quality, applications and performance combined with timely delivery and service, and continually seeks to develop initiatives to improve performance in these key areas.
Gorman-Rupp actively pursues growth opportunities through organic growth, international business expansion and acquisitions.
We regularly invest in training for our employees, in new product development and in modern manufacturing equipment, technology and facilities all designed to increase production efficiency and capacity and drive growth by delivering innovative solutions to our customers. We believe that the diversity of our markets is a major contributor to the generally stable financial growth we have produced for more than 85 years.
The Company places a strong emphasis on cash flow generation and maintaining excellent liquidity and financial flexibility. This focus has afforded us the ability to reinvest our cash resources and preserve a strong balance sheet to position us for future acquisition and product development opportunities. The Company had no bank debt as of December 31, 2021. The $158.8 million of aggregate cash generated by operating activities over the past three years was utilized primarily to pay dividends and the purchase of productivity-enhancing capital equipment. The Company’s cash position increased $17.0 million during 2021 to $125.2 million at December 31, 2021.
The Company generated $51.5 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization during 2021. From these earnings, the Company invested $9.8 million primarily in buildings, machinery and equipment and returned $16.6 million in dividends to shareholders.
Capital expenditures for 2022 are planned to be in the range of $15-$20 million primarily for machinery and equipment purchases, and are expected to be financed through internally-generated funds.
Net sales for 2021 were $378.3 million compared to $349.0 million for 2020, an increase of 8.4% or $29.3 million. Domestic sales of $260.7 million increased 5.6% while international sales of $117.6 million increased 15.3% compared to 2020.
Gross profit was $95.9 million for 2021, resulting in gross margin of 25.3%, compared to gross profit of $89.6 million and gross margin of 25.7% for 2020. The 40 basis point decrease in gross margin was driven by a 140 basis point increase in cost of material, which included an unfavorable LIFO impact of 180 basis points, partially offset by a 100 basis point improvement on labor and overhead resulting from increased sales volume.
SG&A expenses were $56.5 million and 14.9% of net sales for 2021 compared to $53.8 million and 15.4% of net sales for 2020. SG&A expenses increased 5.1% or $2.7 million as a result of compensation, travel and other expense items returning closer to pre-pandemic levels as operational activities return to normal but improved 50 basis points as a percentage of sales primarily as a result of leverage on fixed costs from increased sales volume.
Operating income was $39.4 million for 2021, resulting in an operating margin of 10.4%, compared to operating income of $35.8 million and operating margin of 10.2% for 2020. Operating margin improved 20 basis points primarily as a result of improved leverage on fixed costs from increased sales volume partially offset by an unfavorable LIFO impact.
Other income (expense), net was $2.1 million of expense for 2021 compared to expense of $4.5 million for the same period in 2020. The decrease in expense was due primarily to a non-cash pension settlement charge of $2.3 million in 2021 compared to a charge of $4.6 million in 2020.
Net income was $29.9 million for 2021 compared to $25.2 million in 2020, and earnings per share were $1.14 for 2021 and $0.97 for 2020. Earnings per share included non-cash pension settlement charges of $0.07 and $0.14 per share for 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2021, earnings included an unfavorable LIFO impact of $0.20 per share compared to $0.03 per share in 2020.
The Company’s backlog of orders was $186.0 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $113.1 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of 64.4%. Approximately 92.0% of the Company’s backlog of unfilled orders is scheduled to be shipped during 2022, with the remainder principally during the first half of 2023.
Incoming orders increased 26.9% for the full year and increased 33.0% for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. Incoming orders were up across most markets the Company serves.
On January 27, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized the payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share, representing the 288th consecutive quarterly dividend to be paid by the Company. During 2021, the Company again paid increased dividends and thereby attained its 49th consecutive year of increased dividends. These consecutive years of increases continue to position Gorman-Rupp in the top 50 of all U.S. public companies with respect to number of years of increased dividend payments. The regular dividend yield at December 31, 2021 was 1.5%.
The Company currently expects to continue its exceptional history of paying regular quarterly dividends and increased annual dividends. However, any future dividends will be reviewed individually and declared by our Board of Directors at its discretion, dependent on our assessment of the Company’s financial condition and business outlook at the applicable time.
On October 29, 2021, the Company announced a share repurchase program of up to $50.0 million of the Company’s common shares. Shares may be repurchased from time to time by the Company through a variety of methods, which may include open-market transactions, pre-set trading plans designed in accordance with Rule 10b5-1, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase transactions, or any combination of such methods. The actual number of shares repurchased will depend on prevailing market conditions, alternative uses of capital and other factors, and will be determined at management’s discretion. The Company is not obligated to make any purchases under the program, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The program does not have an expiration date.
Effective January 1, 2022, the role of Chief Executive Officer transitioned from Jeffrey S. Gorman to Scott A. King, who served as the Company’s President and Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Gorman served as CEO since 1998 and following the CEO transition, will continue to serve as the Company’s Executive Chairman of the Board to assist with the Company’s overall strategy and acquisition efforts. Mr. King has been with the Company since 2004 and has held various operational leadership roles of increasing responsibility during this time.
Outlook
Our incoming order trend continues to be very strong while sales during the fourth quarter of 2021 were somewhat impacted by customer-initiated shipment delays. Our team has continued to do a good job of managing the ongoing global supply chain challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused and, as a result, we have seen minimal disruption. We have passed on price increases to offset inflationary pressures on material costs and wages and have leveraged our SG&A expenses as sales volumes have increased.
We enter 2022 with a very healthy backlog and are well positioned to continue to deliver top-line growth. We remain optimistic about the long-term outlook and believe our diverse markets, strong balance sheet, and highly-skilled workforce position us well to continue to deliver shareholder value.
Results of Operations - 2021 Compared to 2020:
Net Sales
Net sales for 2021 were $378.3 million compared to $349.0 million for 2020, an increase of 8.4% or $29.3 million. Domestic sales of $260.7 million increased 5.6% while international sales of $117.6 million increased 15.3% compared to 2020.
Sales in our water markets increased 7.7% or $19.2 million in 2021 compared to 2020. Sales increased $10.1 million in the fire market, $9.2 million in the construction market, $7.7 million in the repair market, and $2.2 million in the agriculture market. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of $10.0 million in the municipal market. The decrease in municipal market sales is primarily due to timing, as both incoming orders and backlog have increased compared to the prior year.
Sales in our non-water markets increased 10.2% or $10.1 million in 2021 compared to 2020. Sales in the OEM market increased $6.5 million, sales in the petroleum market increased $2.2 million, and sales in the industrial market increased $1.4 million.
International sales were $117.6 million in 2021 compared to $102.1 million in 2020 and represented 31% and 29% of total sales for the Company, respectively. As the global economy continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, international sales have increased across nearly all of our markets.
Cost of Products Sold and Gross Profit
Gross profit was $95.9 million for 2021, resulting in gross margin of 25.3%, compared to gross profit of $89.6 million and gross margin of 25.7% for 2020. The 40 basis point decrease in gross margin was driven by a 140 basis point increase in cost of material, which included an unfavorable LIFO impact of 180 basis points, partially offset by a 100 basis point improvement on labor and overhead resulting from increased sales volume.
Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses
SG&A expenses were $56.5 million and 14.9% of net sales for 2021 compared to $53.8 million and 15.4% of net sales for 2020. SG&A expenses increased 5.1% or $2.7 million as a result of compensation, travel and other expense items returning closer to pre-pandemic levels as operational activities return to normal but improved 50 basis points as a percentage of sales primarily as a result of leverage on fixed costs from increased sales volume.
Operating Income
Operating income was $39.4 million for 2021, resulting in an operating margin of 10.4%, compared to operating income of $35.8 million and operating margin of 10.2% for 2020. Operating margin improved 20 basis points primarily as a result of improved leverage on fixed costs from increased sales volume partially offset by an unfavorable LIFO impact.
Net Income
The Company’s effective tax rate was 19.9% for 2021 compared to 19.4% for 2020. The effective tax rate for 2021 was impacted by decreased benefits from credits and permanent items with higher pretax income. We expect our effective tax rate for 2022 to be between 20.0% and 22.0%.
The increase of $4.7 million in net income in 2021 compared to 2020 was due primarily to increased sales.
Earnings per share included non-cash pension settlement charges of $0.07 and $0.14 per share for 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2021, earnings included an unfavorable LIFO impact of $0.20 per share compared to $0.03 per share in 2020.
Results of Operations - 2020 Compared to 2019:
Net Sales
Net sales for 2020 were $349.0 million compared to $398.2 million for 2019, a decrease of 12.4% or $49.2 million. Domestic sales decreased 10.3% or $28.4 million while international sales decreased 17.0% or $20.8 million compared to 2019. From 2019 to 2020 sales decreased across most of our markets primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, along with a slowdown in the oil and gas industry.
Sales in our water markets decreased 9.4% or $25.9 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Sales in the agriculture market increased $1.5 million. This increase was offset by decreases in the construction market of $11.3 million driven primarily by softness in oil and gas drilling activity. Decreases in the repair market of $5.6 million, municipal market of $5.3 million, and fire protection market of $5.2 million were a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sales in our non-water markets decreased 18.9% or $23.3 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, along with reduced demand from midstream and downstream oil and gas customers and softness in oil and gas drilling activity. Sales in the OEM market decreased $8.3 million, sales in the industrial market decreased $7.8 million and sales in the petroleum market decreased $7.2 million.
International sales were $102.1 million in 2020 compared to $122.9 million in 2019 and represented 29% and 31% of total sales for the Company, respectively. In 2020, international sales decreased most notably in the fire protection and all non-water markets.
Cost of Products Sold and Gross Profit
Gross profit was $89.6 million for 2020, resulting in gross margin of 25.7%, compared to gross profit of $102.7 million and gross margin of 25.8% for 2019. Gross margin in 2020 decreased 10 basis points largely due to an unfavorable LIFO impact of 60 basis points compared to 2019 and decreased 120 basis points from the loss of leverage on fixed labor and overhead attributable to lower sales volume. Largely offsetting these items were lower material costs of 170 basis points compared to 2019.
Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses
SG&A expenses were $53.8 million and 15.4% of net sales for 2020 compared to $58.8 million and 14.8% of net sales for 2019. SG&A expenses decreased 8.6% or $5.0 million due to reduced payroll related and travel expenses combined with overall expense management. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales increased 60 basis points primarily as a result of loss of leverage from lower sales volume.
Operating Income
Operating income was $35.8 million for 2020, resulting in an operating margin of 10.2%, compared to operating income of $43.8 million and operating margin of 11.0% for 2019. Operating margin decreased 80 basis points primarily as a result of loss of leverage from lower sales volume.
Net Income
The Company’s effective tax rate was 19.4% for 2020 compared to 20.7% for 2019. The effective tax rate for 2020 was impacted by an increased benefit from credits and permanent items over a lower pretax income as well as a favorable tax rate benefit on foreign operations.
The decrease of $10.6 million in net income in 2020 compared to 2019 was due primarily to lower sales volume and a non-cash pension settlement charge of $3.7 million net of income taxes. Net income in 2019 included a favorable LIFO impact of $0.9 million.
Earnings per share in 2020 included a non-cash pension settlement charge of $0.14 per share. In 2019, earnings benefited from a favorable LIFO impact of $0.04 per share.
Liquidity and Sources of Capital
Cash and cash equivalents totaled $125.2 million and there was no outstanding bank debt at December 31, 2021. In addition, at December 31, 2021, the Company had $23.2 million of borrowing capacity available in bank lines of credit after deducting $6.3 million in outstanding letters of credit primarily related to customer orders. The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants, including limits on additional borrowings and maintenance of certain operating and financial ratios, at all times in 2021 and 2020.
Capital expenditures for 2022, which are expected to consist principally of machinery and equipment purchases, are estimated to be in the range of $15 - $20 million and are expected to be financed through internally generated funds. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company financed its capital improvements and working capital requirements principally through internally generated funds.
We expect to continue to generate cash in excess of our operating needs. We believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy.
The Company expects to contribute up to $2.0 million to its defined benefit pension plan in 2022.
Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure for reporting cash flow, is defined by the Company as adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization, less capital expenditures and dividends. The Company believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on cash available for investments, acquisitions and working capital requirements.
The following table reconciles adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization as reconciled above to free cash flow:
Financial Cash Flow
The change in cash provided by operating activities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to increased accounts receivable compared to a decrease in the prior period. The change in accounts receivable was partially offset by an increase in net income, an increase in accounts payable, and an increase in prepaid assets. The change in cash provided by operating activities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to lower income in 2020 compared to 2019 driven by decreased sales. Cash outflows increased in 2020 due to a reduction in accounts payable primarily from reduced SG&A spend, increased inventory to prepare for customer demand, and increased pension contributions. These cash outflows were offset by cash inflows from reduced accounts receivable driven by decreased sales and a higher deferred tax provision.
During 2021, investing activities of $9.1 million primarily consisted of $9.8 million of capital expenditures for buildings, machinery and equipment. During 2020, investing activities of $7.7 million primarily consisted of $8.0 million of capital expenditures for buildings, machinery and equipment. During 2019, investing activities of $10.8 million primarily consisted of $10.9 million of capital expenditures for buildings, machinery and equipment.
During 2021, financing activities of $18.6 million consisted primarily of dividend payments of $16.6 million and open market share repurchases of $1.2 million. During 2020, financing activities of $16.1 million consisted primarily of dividend payments of $15.4 million. During 2019, financing activities of $17.4 million consisted primarily of dividend payments of $14.4 million and a privately-arranged market value purchase of Company shares in the amount of $2.5 million from a Rupp family estate.
The Company currently expects to continue its exceptional history of paying regular quarterly dividends and increased annual dividends. However, any future dividends will be reviewed individually and declared by our Board of Directors at its discretion, dependent on our assessment of the Company’s financial condition and business outlook at the applicable time.
The Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $50.0 million of the Company’s common shares, of which approximately $49.0 million has yet to be repurchased. The actual number of shares repurchased will depend on prevailing market conditions, alternative uses of capital and other factors, and will be determined at management’s discretion. The Company is not obligated to make any purchases under the program, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
Contractual Obligations
Capital commitments in the table below include contractual commitments to purchase machinery and equipment that have been approved by the Board of Directors. The capital commitments do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future but represent only those substantive items for which the Company is contractually obligated as of December 31, 2021. Also, the Company has operating leases and two financing leases for certain offices, manufacturing facilities, land, office equipment and automobiles. Rental expenses relating to these leases were $0.9 million in 2021, $0.9 million in 2020 and $1.0 million in 2019.
The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations at December 31, 2021:
Critical Accounting Policies
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, management selects the principle or method that is appropriate in the Company’s specific circumstances. Application of these accounting principles requires management to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.
In preparing these Consolidated Financial Statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, giving due regard to materiality. The Company does not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions pertaining to the accounting policies described below.
Revenue Recognition
The Company accounts for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” under which the unit of account is a performance obligation. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from fixed-price customer contracts and the majority of our customer contracts have a single performance obligation. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. For customer contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, which is generally determined based on standalone selling prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus margin.
The transaction price for a customer contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the Company’s performance obligation is satisfied. All of the Company's performance obligations, and associated revenue, are generally satisfied at a point in time, with the exception of certain highly customized pump products, which are satisfied over time as work progresses.
Accounting for long-term contracts involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenue and costs. For long-term contracts, the Company estimates the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete a contract and recognizes that profit as performance obligations are satisfied. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that could span longer than one year. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials and the performance of subcontractors as applicable.
As a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts, the Company reviews and updates its contract-related estimates regularly. Adjustments in estimated profit on contracts are accounted for under the cumulative catch-up method. Under this method, the impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified. Revenue and profit in future periods of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors including both current and historical information. In circumstances where the Company is aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company (e.g., bankruptcy filings, substantial downgrading of credit scores), the Company records a specific allowance for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes will be collected. For all other customers, the Company recognizes allowances for bad debts primarily based on the length of time the receivables are past due. If circumstances change (e.g., an unexpected material adverse change in a large customer’s ability to meet its financial obligations), the Company’s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material amount. Historically, the Company’s collection history has been good.
Inventories and Related Allowance
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories. The estimated allowance is based on a variety of factors, including historical inventory usage and management evaluations. Historically, the Company has not experienced substantive write-offs due to obsolescence. The Company uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for the majority of its inventories.
Product Warranties
A liability is established for estimated future warranty and service claims based on historical claims experience and specific product failures.
Pension Plan and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans
The Company recognizes the obligations associated with its defined benefit pension plan and defined benefit health care plans in its Consolidated Financial Statements. The measurement of liabilities related to its pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans is based on management’s assumptions related to future events including interest rates, return on pension plan assets, rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates. Actual pension plan asset performance will either reduce or increase pension losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which ultimately affects net income. The discount rates used to determine the present value of future benefits are based on estimated yields of investment grade fixed income investments.
The discount rates used to value pension plan obligations were 2.44% and 1.97% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The discount rates used to value postretirement obligations were 2.70% and 2.25% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The discount rates were determined by constructing a zero-coupon spot yield curve derived from a universe of high-quality bonds as of the measurement date. The expected rate of return on pension assets is designed to be a long-term assumption that will be subject to year-to-year variability. The rate for 2021 was 5.10% and 2020 was 5.36%. Actual pension plan asset performance will either reduce or increase unamortized losses included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, which will ultimately affect net income. The assumed rate of compensation increase was 3.50% in both 2021 and 2020.
Substantially all retirees elect to take lump sum settlements of their pension plan benefits. When interest rates are low as they have been the last five years, this subjects the Company to the risk of exceeding an actuarial threshold computed on an annual basis and triggering a GAAP-required non-cash pension settlement loss, which occurred in 2021 and 2020.
The assumption used for the rate of increase in medical costs over the next five years was 5% in both 2021 and 2020.
Income Taxes
The basic principles related to accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns.
Realization of the Company’s deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon the Company’s achievement of projected future taxable income, which management believes will be sufficient to fully utilize the deferred tax assets recorded, with the exception of deferred tax associated with certain state tax credits for which a valuation allowance has been recognized.
The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. Income tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2017.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense for all periods presented. The Company accrued approximately $0.2 million, $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the payment of interest and penalties at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Goodwill and Other Intangibles
The Company accounts for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. Business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized. Amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated useful lives.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment as of October 1, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate there may be a possible permanent loss of value in accordance with ASC 350, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.”
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level and is based on the net assets for each reporting unit, including goodwill and intangible assets. The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing a quantitative impairment assessment is unnecessary.
In assessing the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we identify and assess relevant drivers of fair value and events and circumstances that may impact the fair value and the carrying amount of the reporting unit. The identification of relevant events and circumstances and how these may impact a reporting unit’s fair value or carrying amount involve significant judgments and assumptions. The judgments and assumptions include the identification of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, Company-specific events and share price trends and making the assessment on whether each relevant factor will impact the impairment test positively or negatively and the magnitude of any such impact.
When performing a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment if necessary, or in years where we elect to do so, a discounted cash flow model is used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit, which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an estimated weighted-average cost of capital. The forecasted cash flows are based on the Company’s long-term operating plan and the weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return. Other valuation techniques including comparative market multiples are used when appropriate. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units.
The Company performed a qualitative analyses as of October 1, 2021 and 2020 for all of its reporting units except for one and concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units continues to exceed the respective carrying amounts.
The Company performed a quantitative impairment analysis as of October 1, 2021 for the National Pump Company (“National”) reporting unit and concluded that National’s fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 45% and therefore was not impaired. A sensitivity analysis was performed for the National reporting unit, assuming a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in the expected long-term growth rate or a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital, and both scenarios independently yielded an estimated fair value for the National reporting unit above carrying value. If National fails to experience growth or revises its long-term projections downward, it could be subject to impairment charges in the future. Goodwill relating to the National reporting unit is $13.6 million, 3.2% of the Company’s December 31, 2021 total assets. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
Other indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks and trade names. The fair value of these assets is also tested annually for impairment as of October 1, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate there may be a possible permanent loss of value. The fair value of these assets is determined using a royalty relief methodology similar to that employed when the associated assets were acquired, but using updated estimates of future sales, cash flows and profitability. For 2021 and 2020, the fair value of all indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded the respective carrying values.
Finite-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recovered through future net cash flows generated by the assets. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by such assets. The Company was not aware of any events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value of its finite-lived assets may not be recoverable. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
Other Matters
Certain transactions with related parties occur in the ordinary course of business and are not considered to be material to the Company’s consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows.
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, financings or other relationships with unconsolidated “special purpose entities.”
The Company is not a party to any long-term debt agreements, or any material leases or purchase obligations.
