Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company (including the Notes thereto) included elsewhere in this report. Dollar amounts are in thousands, except for per share amounts.
The Company generates revenues primarily from the sale, leasing, licensing, shipping and installation of precast concrete products and systems for the construction, utility and farming industries. The Company’s operating strategy has involved producing and marketing innovative and proprietary products, including SlenderWall™, a patent pending, lightweight, energy efficient concrete and steel exterior wall panel for use in building construction; J-J Hooks® Barrier, a patented positive-connected highway safety barrier; Sierra Wall™, a patented sound barrier primarily for roadside use; transportable concrete buildings; and SoftSound™, a highway sound attenuation system. In addition, the Company produces utility vaults; farm products such as cattleguards; and custom order precast concrete products with various architectural surfaces.
As a part of the construction industry, the Company’s sales and net income may vary greatly from quarter to quarter over a given year. Because of the cyclical nature of the construction industry, many factors outside of the Company’s control, such as weather and project delays, affect the Company’s production schedule, possibly causing a momentary slowdown in sales and net income. As a result of these factors, the Company is not always able to earn a profit for each period, therefore, please read Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the accompanying financial statements with these factors in mind.
On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China (the “COVID-19 outbreak”) and the risks to the international community as the virus spread globally beyond its point of origin. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure globally.
The full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, including a recent resurgence in the United States, continues to evolve as of the date of this report. As such, it is uncertain as to the full magnitude that the pandemic will have on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity, and future results of operations. The Company had previously experienced an adverse impact to its business by a reduction in revenues in 2020 from that of 2019, a reduction in backlog during 2020 from that in 2019, lower production volumes, employee absences during 2020 and 2021, and bidding restrictions within certain key states such as Maryland and North Carolina. The Company is currently experiencing delays in receipt of materials through its supply chain. The Company may be further negatively impacted in the following respects:
a)
by the potential inability of customers of the Company to pay amounts owed to the Company for products or services already provided should their businesses suffer setbacks; this risk is heightened by the relatively long lag time experienced by the Company in collecting accounts receivable (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below);
b)
by potential supply side issues should our vendors experience hardships, and have to reduce or terminate operations, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, impacting the Company’s sourcing of materials;
c)
by increased adverse effects on our workforce due to contracting or taking care of a relative who has contracted COVID-19, or have been quarantined by a medical professional; in this respect, our workforce had previously been impacted as of the financial statement date with an effect on operations at all locations, but this impact has substantially diminished as of the filing date, but no assurance can be provided as to future impacts, particularly in view of potential new coronavirus outbreaks;
d)
in the event that any of the three states in which we have facilities provide for the quarantine of our manufacturing employees, our production manufacturing will be significantly affected;
e)
in the event that any of the states in which we sell our products and services may eliminate, cancel, or delay projects due to monetary limitations resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak; in this respect, the Company had previously seen a reduction in bidding activity;
f)
the reduction of state infrastructure budgets due to the reduction in funding through the gas tax, or other funding sources;
g)
the increase in the overall loan defaults, which in turn impacts the banking sector’s ability to fund projects in which the Company’s products may be utilized; and
h)
in the event that economic hardships force the Company to default on loan payments, our loans may be called and our ability to borrow under our bank line of credit could cease;
Management is actively monitoring the global situation on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry, and workforce. Although the Company experienced a loss in the first quarter of 2020 and reduced revenues for the year 2020 as compared to 2019, as well as experiencing factors described above, given the daily evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak and the global responses to curb its spread, the Company is not able to ultimately estimate the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on its results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity for future years.
The discussions below, including without limitation with respect to liquidity, are subject to the future effects of the COVID-19 outbreak. In this respect, should the outbreak cause serious economic harm in our areas of operation, our revenue expectations are unlikely to be fulfilled.
Overview
Overall, the Company’s financial bottom line performance was significantly higher in 2021 when compared to 2020. The Company had net income for 2021 in the amount of $7,570 compared to net income of $2,665 for 2020. Sales increased by $6,780 to $50,642 in 2021 from $43,862 in 2020. The increase in sales is mainly from barrier rentals, which included multiple short-term special barrier rental projects in the first quarter 2021 and, to a lesser extent, an increase in linear feet rented over the prior year of the core rental fleet. Future barrier rental revenues are not expected to continue to trend at the same rate as in the first quarter of 2021 due to the nature and frequency of the short-term special barrier projects, although the Company anticipates continued growth of core rental revenues. Product sales, royalty income, and shipping and installation revenue also increased in 2021 as compared to 2020. The significant increase in barrier rentals also favorably impacted gross margins, excluding royalties, with an increase to 25% in 2021 from 22% in 2020. Operating expenses for 2021 increased over 2020 mainly due to increased non-cash stock compensation expense and increased selling costs associated with additional sales personnel. Fourth quarter 2021 revenues were $10,017 compared to $11,073 in the fourth quarter 2020. The net income for the fourth quarter 2021 was $24 compared to $713 in the fourth quarter 2020. The decrease in revenue and net income for the fourth quarter 2021 as compared to the fourth quarter 2020 was primarily due to one-time special projects occurring in the fourth quarter 2020, delays in customer approvals for production, and to a lesser extent an increase in material and labor costs due to inflationary factors. The Company expects the first quarter 2022 to experience similar inflationary factors and customer approval delays as the fourth quarter 2021. With the increase in backlog in March 2022, as compared to the prior year, from approximately $19.6 million to $29.0 million, the Company anticipates greater sales volumes in the second and third quarter 2022, although no assurance can be provided. The Company continues to increase marketing and sales efforts towards SlenderWall sales and barrier rentals, in line with long-term strategic objectives.
Results of Operations
Year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had total revenue of $50,642 compared to total revenue of $43,862 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $6,780, or 15%. Revenue includes product sales, barrier rentals, royalty income, and shipping and installation revenues. Product sales are further divided into soundwall, architectural and SlenderWall™ panels, miscellaneous wall panels, highway barrier, Easi-Set®/Easi-Span® buildings, utility products, and miscellaneous precast products. The following table summarizes the revenue by type and a comparison for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):
The revenue items: soundwall sales, architectural panel sales, SlenderWall sales, miscellaneous wall sales, miscellaneous sales, barrier rentals, and royalty income are recognized as revenue over time. The revenue items: barrier sales, Easi-Set and Easi-Span building sales, utility sales, and shipping and installation revenue are recognized as revenue at a point in time.
Soundwall Sales - Soundwall panel sales slightly increased by 7% in 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to increased production during 2021 at the North Carolina and South Carolina facilities as compared to 2020, and continued production at the Virginia plant for the largest soundwall contract in Company history, which was initially awarded during 2018. The Company expects soundwall panel sales to be similar in 2022 as compared to 2021, although no assurance can be provided.
Architectural Sales - Architectural panel sales increased by 34% in 2021 compared to 2020. The Company was awarded a large architectural project which began production in the fourth quarter of 2020, with the majority of production occurring in 2021. Architectural sales are expected to decrease during 2022, as compared to 2021, with an anticipated shift to more SlenderWall sales, although no assurance can be provided.
SlenderWall Sales - SlenderWall panel sales increased by 89% in 2021 when compared to 2020. SlenderWall sales are generated on a project basis, and success is determined by the number and dollar value of projects awarded and produced in any particular period. The increase is mainly attributable to one large project which started production at the end of the second quarter 2021. Currently, the Company has the largest quantity of bids out for the SlenderWall product in history and expects to be awarded multiple projects in the near future. The Company continues to focus sales initiatives on SlenderWall, but no assurance can be given as to the success of this endeavor.
Miscellaneous Wall Sales - Miscellaneous wall sales can be highly customized precast concrete products or retaining and lagging panels that do not fit other product categories. Miscellaneous wall sales decreased by 30% in 2021 when compared to 2020 due to the decreased amount of retaining wall projects in production. Miscellaneous sales are expected to trend similar in 2022, as compared to 2021, although no assurance can be provided.
Barrier Sales - Barrier sales decreased by 15% in 2021 when compared to 2020. The main reason for the decrease is due to reduced barrier production demand in North Carolina and South Carolina, combined with the increase in the core fleet of barrier rentals. Aligning with the Company’s strategy to shift to barrier rentals versus barrier sales in the Delaware to Virginia region, barrier sales are expected to trend lower in 2022 than previous years.
Easi-Set® and Easi-Span® Building Sales - The Easi-Set® Buildings program includes Easi-Set®, plant assembled and Easi-Span®, site assembled, and an extensive line of pre-engineered restrooms. Building sales slightly increased by 3% in 2021 as compared to 2020. Building and restroom sales are expected to continue to trend similar during 2022 as compared to 2021, although no assurance can be provided.
Utility Sales - Utility products are mainly comprised of underground utility vaults used in infrastructure construction. Utility product sales increased by 88% in 2021 compared to 2020. The Company continues to competitively bid on utility projects to gain market share and has recently won multiple data center projects increasing the sales volume of dry utility vaults. Utility sales are expected to increase for 2022 as compared to 2021, although no assurance can be provided.
Miscellaneous Product Sales - Miscellaneous products are products that are produced or sold that do not meet the criteria defined for other revenue categories. Examples would include precast concrete slabs, blocks or small add-on items. For 2021, miscellaneous product sales decreased by 22% when compared to 2020. The change is mainly attributed to specialty concrete blocks produced at the North Carolina plant which began in 2020 and significantly decreased during the third quarter 2021. Miscellaneous product sales are expected to decrease in 2022 as compared to 2021, although no assurance can be provided.
Barrier Rentals - Barrier rentals increased significantly in 2021 as compared to 2020 due to the higher quantity of linear feet rented over the previous year and, to a greater extent, a few short-term special projects during 2021. A substantial portion of the total revenue from these special projects was earned in the first quarter 2021. As indicated above, the Company is shifting its focus to barrier rentals compared to barrier sales with the significant increase in the rental fleet beginning in late 2019, and continued plans to significantly increase the fleet during 2022. Future barrier rental revenues are not expected to continue trending at the same rate as in 2021 due to the nature and frequency of the short-term special barrier projects in the early part of that period, however the Company generally expects increased barrier rentals of the core rental fleet for future periods, although no assurance can be given.
Royalty Income - Royalties significantly increased by 31% in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase in royalties is mainly due to the increase in barrier royalties during 2021 compared to 2020. Infrastructure spending continues to drive royalties, and the Company anticipates 2022 royalties to increase compared to 2021 with the approval of the J-J Hooks barrier in California and Florida, although no assurance can be given.
Shipping and Installation - Shipping revenue results from shipping our products to the customers’ final destination and is recognized when the shipping services take place. Installation activities include installation of our products at the customers’ construction site. Installation revenue results when attaching architectural wall panels to a building, installing an Easi-Set® building at a customers’ site, setting highway barrier, or setting any of our other precast products at a site specific to the requirements of the owner. Shipping and installation revenues increased by 17% for 2021 when compared to 2020. The increase is mainly attributed to the increase in shipping, setting, and offloading associated with core barrier rentals during 2021 as compared to the prior year.
Cost of Goods Sold - Total cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $36,222, an increase of $3,402, or 10%, from $32,820 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Total cost of goods sold as a percentage of total revenue, not including royalties, decreased to 75% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 78% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue, not including royalties, is mainly due to the increase in barrier rental revenues, which typically have higher margins than product sales, and the increase in short-term special barrier rental projects, which carry slightly higher margins due to the complexity and risk of the projects.
General and Administrative Expenses - For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s general and administrative expenses increased by $427, or 9%, to $5,416 from $4,989 during the same period in 2020. The increase is mainly attributed to an increase in non-cash stock compensation awarded and vested in 2021 as compared to 2020.
Selling Expenses - Selling expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $542, or 24%, to $2,836 from $2,294 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Selling expenses increased during 2021 due to additional salespersons hired and increased advertising expenses. The Company expects selling expenses to increase in future periods with the plan for additional sales associates and increased advertising spending aligning with the strategy to increase SlenderWall sales and barrier rentals.
Operating Income - The Company had operating income for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $6,168 compared to operating income of $3,759 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $2,409, or 64%. The increase in operating income was mainly due to the increase in gross profit associated with the increase in total revenue, mainly deriving from royalties and barrier rentals. Operating results for the 2020 periods were also adversely affected due to COVID-19 related factors.
Interest Expense - Interest expense was $190 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $217 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease of $27, or 12%, was due primarily to the payoff of two long-term notes during 2021. Interest expense for 2022 is expected to increase, as compared to 2021, with the financing of real property acquired during the fourth quarter 2021.
Income Tax Expense - The Company had income tax expense of $1,524 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to income tax expense of $1,127 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company had an effective rate of 16.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to an effective rate of 29.7% for the same period in 2020. The decrease in the effective tax rate is mainly attributed to the exclusion of $2,692 from federal taxable income related to PPP loan forgiveness under section 1106(i) of the CARES Act.
Net Income - The Company had net income of $7,570 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to net income of $2,665 for the same period in 2020. The basic and diluted earnings per share was $1.45 for 2021 compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.51 for the year ended December 31, 2020. There were 5,205 basic and 5,232 diluted weighted average shares outstanding in 2021, and 5,185 basic and 5,187 diluted weighted average shares outstanding in 2020. Profitability for the year ended December 31, 2021 was positively impacted by the forgiveness of the PPP loan (described below in Liquidity and Capital Resources) in the amount of $2,692.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company financed its capital expenditures requirements for 2021 with cash flows from operations, cash balances on hand and notes payable to a bank. The Company had $4,192 of debt obligations at December 31, 2021, of which $468 is scheduled to mature within twelve months. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the Company made repayments of outstanding debt in the amount $793 and received $49 in proceeds of borrowings deriving from the financing of a vehicle. The Company did not draw on the line of credit during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.
The Company has a mortgage note payable to Summit Community Bank (the “Bank”) for the construction of its North Carolina facility. The note carries a ten year term at a fixed interest rate of 3.64% annually per the Promissory Note Rate Conversion Agreement, with monthly payments of $22, and is secured by all of the assets of Smith-Carolina and a guarantee by the Company. The balance of the note payable at December 31, 2021 was $1,812.
On March 27, 2020, the Company completed the refinancing of existing loans with a note payable to the Bank in the amount of $2,701. A portion of the funds in the amount of $678 were secured for improvements to an existing five acre parcel for additional storage at the Midland, Virginia plant. The loan is collateralized by a first lien position on the Virginia property, building, and assets. The refinance also released the lien on the Smith-Columbia plant in Hopkins, South Carolina (Columbia). The interest rate per the Promissory Note is fixed at 3.99% per annum, with principal and interest payments payable monthly over 120 months in the amount of $27. The loan matures on March 27, 2030. The balance of the note payable at December 31, 2021 was $2,304.
Additionally, the Company has 3 smaller installment loans with annual interest rates between 2.9% and 4.5%, maturing between 2022 and 2025, with varying balances totaling $76.
Subsequent to December 31, 2021, on February 10, 2022, the Company completed the financing for its prior acquisition of certain real property in Midland, VA totaling approximately 29.8 acres with a note payable to the Bank in the amount of $2,805. The loan is collateralized by a first lien position on the above-referenced real property. The interest rate is fixed at 4.09% per annum, with principal and interest payments payable monthly over 180 months in the amount of $21. The loan matures on February 10, 2037.
Under the loan covenants with the Bank, the Company is limited to annual capital expenditures of $3,500 and must maintain tangible net worth of $10,000. The Company received a special exception to the capital expenditure covenant from the Bank to purchase certain real property during 2021 in the amount of $3,300. The Company is in compliance with all covenants pursuant to the loan agreements as of December 31, 2021.
In addition to the notes payable discussed above, on April 16, 2020, the Company obtained a loan, evidenced by a promissory note, under the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) from the Bank in the amount of $2,692. The PPP provides for loans to qualifying businesses, the proceeds of which may only be used for payroll costs, rent, utilities, mortgage interest, and interest on other pre-existing indebtedness. The interest rate per the promissory note, dated April 16, 2020 and executed by the Company in favor of the Bank, was fixed at 1.00% per annum, with principal and interest payments starting thirty (30) days after the amount of forgiveness is determined under section 1106 of the CARES Act. The proceeds of the loan were required to be utilized pursuant to the requirements of the PPP, and all or a portion of the loan could be forgiven in accordance with the PPP applicable rules, regulations, and guidelines. On July 9, 2021, the Company received loan forgiveness for the full amount of the loan of $2,692.
The Company also has a $4,000 line of credit with the Bank with no balance outstanding as of December 31, 2021. The line of credit is evidenced by a commercial revolving promissory note which carries a variable interest rate of prime and matures on October 1, 2022. The loan is collateralized by a first lien position on the Company’s accounts receivable and inventory and a second lien position on all other business assets. Key provisions of the line of credit require the Company (i) to obtain bank approval for capital expenditures in excess of $3,500 during the term of the loan; and (ii) to obtain bank approval prior to its funding any acquisition. On October 21, 2021, the Company received a Commitment Letter from the Bank to provide a guidance line of credit specifically to purchase business equipment in an amount up to $1,500. The commitment provides for the purchase of equipment for which a note payable will be executed with a term not to exceed five years with an interest rate at the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus 0.50% with a floor of 3.50% per annum. The loan is collateralized by a first lien position on all equipment purchased under the line. The commitment for the guidance line of credit matures on October 21, 2022. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had not purchased any equipment pursuant to the $1,500 commitment.
At December 31, 2021, the Company had cash totaling $13,492 and no investment securities available for sale compared to cash totaling $8,764 and $1,228 of investment securities available for sale at December 31, 2020. Investment securities at December 31, 2020 consisted of shares of USVAX (a Virginia Bond Fund). In the fourth quarter 2021, the Company sold all of the investment securities. During 2021, the Company’s operating activities provided $9,126 of cash due mainly to operating income, collection of accounts receivable, cash received for deferred revenue, and accrued but unpaid income taxes. In 2021, investing activities used $3,654 in cash primarily for the purchase of additional land in Virginia, the purchase of rental barrier, manufacturing equipment, and a vehicle, partially offset by the sale of the USVAX shares in the fourth quarter 2021. Financing activities used $744 in cash in 2021 mainly as a result of repaying long-term debt.
Capital spending, including financed additions, increased from $2,627 in 2020 to $5,367 in 2021. Capital expenditures in 2021 included spending for additional land in Virginia, rental barrier, manufacturing equipment, and a vehicle. While the Company anticipates capital spending for 2022 to be approximately $8,000, which includes a significant expansion in the barrier rental fleet with approximate costs of $5,000, and approximately $3,000 for yard development and miscellaneous manufacturing equipment, excluding acquisitions and plant expansions (which none are anticipated at this time), such plans may change if the Company is adversely effected by the coronavirus outbreak.
The Company’s notes payable are financed at fixed rates of interest. This leaves the Company almost impervious to fluctuating interest rates. Increases in such rates will only affect the interest paid by the Company if new debt is obtained with a variable interest rate.
The Company’s cash flow from operations is affected by production schedules set by contractors, which generally provide for payment 45 to 75 days after the products are produced and with some architectural contracts, retainage may be held until the entire project is completed. This payment schedule could result in liquidity problems for the Company because it must bear the cost of production for its products before it receives payment. The Company’s days sales outstanding (DSO) in 2021 and 2020 were 91 and 89 days, respectively. Although no assurances can be given, the Company believes that its current cash resources, anticipated cash flow from operations, and the availability under the line of credit will be sufficient to finance the Company’s operations for at least the next 12 months.
The Company’s inventory at December 31, 2021 was $2,845 and at December 31, 2020 was $2,194, an increase of $651. The annual inventory turns for 2021 and 2020 were 15.4 and 13.9, respectively. Finished goods inventory slightly increased for 2021 as compared to 2020.
Critical Accounting Policies
The Company’s significant accounting policies are more fully described in its Summary of Accounting Policies to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted within the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. The Company does not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below, however, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.
The Company evaluates the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of each quarter. In performing this evaluation, the Company analyzes the payment history of its significant past due accounts, subsequent cash collections on these accounts, comparative accounts receivable aging statistics, and other customer specific considerations existing and known as of the time of the analysis. Based on this information, along with other related factors, the Company develops what it considers to be a reasonable estimate of the uncollectible amounts included in accounts receivable. This estimate involves significant judgment by the management of the Company. Actual uncollectible amounts may differ from the Company’s estimate.
The Company recognizes revenue on the sale of its standard precast concrete products, and the associated shipping and installation revenue, at shipment date, including revenue derived from any projects to be completed under short-term contracts. Leasing and royalties are recognized as revenue over time. Certain sales of soundwall, SlenderWall, and other architectural concrete products are recognized over time because as the Company’s performance creates or enhances customer controlled assets or creates or enhances an asset with no alternative use, and the Company has an enforceable right to receive compensation. Over time product contracts are estimated based on the number of units produced (output method) during the period multiplied by the unit rate stated in the contract. As the output method is driven by units produced, the Company recognizes revenues based on the value transferred to the customer relative to the remaining value to be transferred. The Company also matches the costs associated with the units produced. If a contract is projected to result in a loss, the entire contract loss is recognized in the period when the loss was first determined and the amount of the loss updated in subsequent reporting periods. Revenue recognition also includes an amount related to a contract asset or contract liability. If the recognized revenue is greater than the amount billed to the customer, a contract asset is recorded in accounts receivable trade - unbilled. Conversely, if the amount billed to the customer is greater than the recognized revenue, a contract liability is recorded in customer deposits. Changes in the job performance, job conditions and final contract settlements are factors that influence management’s assessment of total contract value and therefore, profit and revenue recognition.
Seasonality
The Company services the construction industry primarily in areas of the United States where construction activity may be inhibited by adverse weather during the winter. As a result, the Company may experience reduced revenues from December through February and realize the substantial part of its revenues during the other months of the year. The Company may experience lower profits, or losses, during the winter months, and as such, must have sufficient working capital to fund its operations at a reduced level until the spring construction season. The failure to generate or obtain sufficient working capital during the winter may have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Inflation
Management believes that the Company’s operations were affected by inflation in 2021 and 2020, particularly in the purchases of certain raw materials such as cement and aggregates, steel, and also with labor costs. The Company believes that raw material pricing and labor costs will increase in 2022, although no assurance can be given regarding future pricing or costs.
Backlog
As of March 14, 2022 the Company’s sales backlog was approximately $29.0 million as compared to approximately $19.6 million at approximately the same time in 2021. It is estimated that most of the projects in the sales backlog will be produced within 12 months, but a few will be produced over multiple years. The increase in backlog was due to an increase in orders for products to be produced at all three manufacturing facilities, as well as an increase in the barrier rental backlog, as compared to the prior year. The Company expects the backlog to increase with continued bidding on large infrastructure and SlenderWall/architectural projects, although no assurance can be given.
The risk exists that recessionary economic conditions and the coronavirus outbreak may adversely affect the Company more than it has experienced to date. To mitigate these economic and other risks, the Company has a broader product offering than most competitors and has historically been a leader in innovation and new product development in the industry. The Company is continuing this strategy through the development, marketing and sales efforts for its new products.
The Company continues to evaluate both production and administrative processes, and has streamlined many of these processes through lean activities. During 2021 and 2020, the Company, through lean activities, continued to see positive effects in production and office areas. The lean business philosophy is a long-term, customer focused approach to continuous improvement by eliminating waste and providing value. It is management’s intention to continue on the lean journey while implementing a lean culture throughout the Company to help reach our goals for 2022. The Company’s lean efforts are aimed to increase quality to the customer, significantly reduce defects, while increasing production capacity and sales volume. In order to meet these goals, substantial improvements through lean tools and lean thinking are being implemented company wide.
