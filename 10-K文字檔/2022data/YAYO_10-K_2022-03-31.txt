ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION
Our Corporate History and Background
EVmo was initially formed on June 21, 2016 as a Delaware limited liability company under the name “YayYo, LLC.” The Company was subsequently converted into a Delaware corporation pursuant to Section 265 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”). The Company now operates as a “C” corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware.
We became a reporting company when, on March 17, 2017, an offering circular on Form 1-A relating to a best-efforts offering of our Common Stock pursuant to “Regulation A+” of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), was qualified by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Then, on November 15, 2019, we completed an initial public offering of 2,625,000 shares of Common Stock, at $4.00 per share, for gross proceeds, before underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses, of $10.5 million and our Common Stock was listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the ticker symbol “YAYO.”
On February 10, 2020, after being advised by Nasdaq that it believed we no longer met the conditions for continued listing, the Company announced its intent to voluntarily delist its Common Stock. Since delisting from Nasdaq, our Common Stock has been quoted and traded on the Pink Open Market, which is operated by OTC Markets Group, under the same ticker symbol. The delisting was effective on March 1, 2020.
In September 2020, we changed our name from YayYo, Inc. to Rideshare Rental, Inc., in order for our corporate brand to better reflect our principal businesses, ridesharing and vehicle rentals. In February 2021, we again changed our name to EVmo, Inc., to underscore our commitment to making a full transition to electric vehicles by the end of 2024.
We are a holding company operating principally through two wholly-owned subsidiaries: Rideshare and Distinct Cars. The Rideshare Platform provides TNC drivers with an online booking platform, while Distinct Cars maintains a fleet of passenger vehicles and transit vans for use in the last-mile logistical space for rent to our TNC driver customers, enabling such drivers to meet the vehicle suitability and other requirements of rideshare and delivery gig companies such as Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and Grubhub. Through Rideshare and Distinct Cars, we seek to become a leading provider of rental vehicles to drivers in the ridesharing and delivery gig spaces, and an industry leader in supplying transit vans for last-mile logistics.
Impact of COVID-19 on our business
On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern,” and on March 11, 2020, it characterized the outbreak as a “pandemic.” In response, numerous states and cities ordered their residents to cease traveling to non-essential jobs and to curtail all unnecessary travel, and similar restrictions were recommended by the federal government. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, which saw the initial rapid spread of COVID-19, rideshare companies were severely and negatively impacted, as demand plummeted. Consequently, the Company experienced a decline in revenue during the first half of 2020, which had a negative impact on our cash flows, but we then saw a positive upward movement in revenue during the second half of 2020, which continued through fiscal 2021. This was consistent with the experience of the TNCs whose drivers we service. According to Bloomberg Second Measure, Uber and Lyft sales were up 104% and 84% year-over-year, respectively, in February 2022 from one year earlier, even in spite of the Delta and Omicron variants that resulted in spikes of infections through periods of 2021.
Given the current prevalence of FDA-approved eligible vaccines across most age groups, the marked decrease in the number of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths in the first quarter of 2022, and the resulting easement of pandemic restrictions in our active markets, we are optimistic that COVID-19 will not have a material impact on our operations in the current fiscal year. However, certain factors- including, for example, a new, more aggressive and deadly variant that is resistant to the vaccines- could reverse the positive trends of recent months and alter our prediction.
Principles of consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Distinct Cars and RideShare. (As of the date of this Report, our other wholly-owned subsidiary, EV Vehicles, has no material assets and generates no revenue,) All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
Consolidated Results of Operations-Year ended December 31, 2020, Compared to Year ended December 31, 2019.
Total Revenues
Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $10,235,630, an increase of $2,614,450 or 34.3% compared to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $7,621,180. The increase is attributed to improved operating results stemming from, in part, drivers who regularly extend their vehicle rentals through Rideshare and an increase in the size of Distinct Cars’ vehicle fleet.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $8,551,454, an increase of $3,287,980 or 62.5% compared to cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $5,263,474. Depreciation expense on the vehicles is included in cost of revenues. The increase is due to higher depreciation expense due to an increase in fleet size and higher repairs and maintenance, including bodyshop expenses to redeploy vehicles. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 our cost of revenue was 83.5% and 69.1% of our revenue, respectively. The increase in the cost of revenue is mainly attributed to an increase in bodyshop-related expenses in the second half of the fiscal year, as we repaired a number of fleet vehicles, as well as an increase in insurance costs due to more vehicles added to the fleet.
Selling and Marketing Expenses
Selling and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $283,181, representing a decrease of $207,222 or 42.3% over the year ended December 31, 2020 of $490,403. The decrease is attributed to more efficient marketing efforts as we utilize platforms and channels more effectively.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $8,397,149, representing an increase of $3,108,833 or 58.8% over the year ended December 31, 2020 of $5,288,316. This increase is principally attributed to higher payroll expenses and increased legal fees in connection with our financings and litigation matters.
Total Operating Expenses
Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $8,880,083, representing an increase of $3,101,364 or 53.7% compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 of $5,778,719. The increase is due to the aggregate reasons described in the expense-related disclosure above.
Interest Expense, Net
Interest and financing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $7,880,512 compared to $265,839 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest and financing cost for the year ended December 31, 2021 was due to costs in connection with our debt and term loan financings in April and July 2021 and, to a lesser extent, to the leasehold arrangements for our vehicle fleet.
Gain on Forgiveness of Debt
Gain on forgiveness of debt for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $8,000 as compared to $184,775 for the same period in 2020, as, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the entire amount of the loan we received under the Paycheck Protection Program of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act was forgiven, and in the year ended December 31, 2021, a small balance remaining on an Economic Impact Disaster Loan granted by the Small Business Administration Loan was also forgiven.
Net Loss
The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $14,984,878, representing an increase of $11,482,801 or 327.9% compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 of $3,502,077. The increase is due to the aggregate reasons described in the expense-related disclosure above.
Liquidity, Capital Resources and Plan of Operations
In November 2019, we completed our initial public offering of Common Stock, sold a total of 2,625,000 common shares at a price of $4.00 per share. Total gross proceeds from the offering were $10,500,000, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. In January 2022, we completed a follow-on offering of 27,400,000 shares of Common Stock at a price of $0.50 per share, for total gross proceeds of $13,700,000.
In January 2021, we received $500,000 from one of our stockholders in exchange for a convertible note. The note was convertible into shares of Common Stock at $0.50 per share, and was converted into 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock in February 2021.
In April 2021, as part of a securities purchase agreement, we issued and sold to an investor a 12.5% original issue discount convertible promissory note and a Common Stock purchase warrant. The note had an original principal amount of $2,250,000, with an original issue discount of $250,000. It bore interest at a fixed rate of ten percent (10%), was convertible into shares of Common Stock at a price of $3.00 per share (subject to adjustment), and was to mature on January 12, 2022. The warrant granted the investor the right to purchase 187,500 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $3.00, subject to adjustment; it is exercisable at any time within five (5) years of the date of issuance and additional warrants, each for 93,750 shares of Common Stock with an exercise price of $3.00 per share, were to be issued by the Company to the investor each month that the note remains outstanding.
In July 2021, we entered into a term loan, guarantee and security agreement we entered into with EICF Agent LLC, as agent for the lenders, and Energy Impact Credit Fund I, LP, as lender, providing for a secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $15.0 million, consisting of a $7.5 million closing date term loan facility and up to $7.5 million of borrowings under a delayed draw term loan facility. The initial loan was fully drawn on the closing date. The term loan agreement will mature on July 9, 2026.
In connection with the term loan, we entered into an exchange agreement with the investor who we entered into the securities purchase agreement in April 2021. As part of the exchange agreement, the investor agreed to exchange the note we issued to it in April 2021 for 230,375 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, and a warrant. The warrant granted the investor the right to purchase 93,750 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $3.00, subject to adjustment. This warrant is exercisable in full at any time within five (5) years of the date of issuance. Additional warrants on substantially identical terms were issued by the Company to the investor monthly until such time as the Preferred Stock was redeemed or converted in full, after which a final warrant was issued. As of the date of this Report, all shares of Series B Preferred Stock have been converted by their holder into shares of Common Stock, or redeemed by us.
Current Assets, Liabilities and Working Capital
At December 31, 2021, the Company’s current assets totaled $4,077,934, current liabilities totaled $7,051,073, and working capital was a deficit of $2,973,139. At December 31, 2020, the Company’s current assets totaled $215,990, current liabilities totaled $4,461,560, and working capital was a deficit of $4,245,570.
Regarding current liabilities, the amounts categorized as accounts payable and accrued expenses totaled $4,940,580 and $2,119,003 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $2,821,577 or 133.2%.
Since inception, our principal sources of operating funds have been: (i) proceeds from equity financings, including two public offerings of our Common Stock and the private sales of our Common Stock to certain investors in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act; and (ii) the term loan for $7.5 million described above. As of the date of this Report, we believe that we have sufficient working capital to finance our operating expenses for this fiscal year and to implement the 2022 phase of our electric vehicles growth strategy, or the EV strategy. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $1,853,928 in cash, and shortly thereafter we completed our second public offering of Common Stock.
Capital Expenditures
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had capital expenditures of $5,907,439 in leased vehicles. Most of the Company’s vehicles are financed with leases. At December 31, 2021 the Company had $13,514,619 of rental vehicles, net of accumulated depreciation in the amount of $4,627,300, totaling $8,887,319 in net rental vehicles. At December 31, 2020 the Company had $9,067,885 of rental vehicles, net of accumulated depreciation in the amount of $2,871,452, totaling $6,196,433 in net rental vehicles. The Company’s rental vehicles are depreciated over their estimated useful life of five years. The lease terms for those rental vehicles that are leased are generally for one to three years and the Company has the right to purchase the leased vehicle at the end of the lease terms.
Statement of Cash Flows
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash expended by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $(2,501,609), which was a decrease of $1,964,886 from the net cash generated from operating activities of $536,723 for the same period in 2020. The increase is principally due to the increase in total operating expenses described above.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash generated from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $4,329,698, which was a change of $6,049,960 from the net cash expended in financing activities of $(1,720,262) for the same period in 2020. The change is principally due to the debt and equity financings we completed in April and July 2021, respectively.
Current Plan of Operations
Our plan of operations is currently focused on the growth and ongoing development of our operating businesses: (i) the Rideshare Platform, offered through Rideshare, and (ii) our vehicle fleet, which is commercially available through Distinct Cars. We expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future for the continuing operations of our businesses. Moreover, we have embarked on our EV strategy, in which we intend to replace our entire fleet of vehicles with all electric vehicles by 2024. At this time, we cannot reliably estimate the timing or aggregate amount of all of the costs associated with these efforts.
Although, as we state above, we believe we have sufficient working capital to finance our operations in fiscal 2022 and to execute the 2022 phase of our EV strategy, it is possible that our expansion plan may require us to raise significant additional capital within a short period of time.
We continually reevaluate our plan of operations to determine how we can most effectively utilize our resources. The completion of any aspect of our plan of operations is highly dependent upon the ready availability of cash to implement that aspect of the plan and other factors, several of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our current capital resources will be adequate to continue to fund our ongoing operations, nor can there be any assurance that, should we require additional capital, we will successfully obtain it on favorable terms, or at all. The potential inadequacy of our existing capital or the inability to secure additional capital could have a material adverse effect on us, including the possibility that we would have to sell or forego a portion or all of our assets or cease operations. If we discontinue our operations, we may not have sufficient funds to pay any amounts to our stockholders.
If our operating businesses fail to achieve anticipated financial results, our existing capital will likely be depleted more quickly than we anticipate and our ability to raise additional capital in the future to fund our operations would likely be seriously impaired. If in the future we are not able to demonstrate favorable financial results or projections from our operating businesses, we may not be able to raise the capital we need to continue operations.
Similarly, because our working capital requirements depend upon numerous factors there can be no assurance that our current cash resources will be sufficient to fund our operations.
Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies
The Company periodically enters into a series of monthly vehicle leasing agreements with ACME Auto Leasing and Utica Leasing Company, each with an approximate lease term of 12 to 36 months. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had total principal lease obligations before residuals in the amount of $3,989,210 and $2,400,565, respectively. The Company owes monthly payments under each lease agreement ranging from approximately $285 per month to $1,150 per month. At the end of the term of each lease agreement, we have the right to purchase ownership and title of the subject vehicle for a nominal payment. In addition, the lease agreements are subject to and secured by a grant of a purchase money security interest on each leased vehicle. We expect the useful life of each vehicle to be approximately five years but also expect to cycle vehicles at three years.
We lease and maintain our principal offices at 195 South Robertson Blvd., Beverly Hills, CA 90211, where the majority of our operational staff conducts its activities on a day-to-day basis. We do not currently own any real estate.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
In the ordinary course of our business, we are not exposed to market risk of the sort that may arise from changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates, or that may otherwise arise from transactions in derivatives.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. Preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. In many instances, we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. This applies in particular to useful lives of non-current assets and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving our judgments and estimates.
Equipment and Rental Vehicles
Equipment and Rental Vehicles are stated at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings as incurred; additions, renewals and betterments are capitalized. When equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Depreciation of equipment and rental vehicles is provided using the straight-line method for substantially all assets with estimated lives as follows:
The Company has not changed its estimate for the useful lives of its equipment and rental vehicles, but would expect that a decrease in the estimated useful lives of equipment and rental vehicles of one year would result in an annual increase to depreciation expense of approximately $675,000, and an increase in the estimated useful lives of equipment and rental vehicles of one year would result in an annual decrease to depreciation expense of approximately $450,000.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. ASC 740 requires a company to use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The Company has not changed it methodology for estimating the valuation allowance. A change in valuation allowance affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made and could be significant due to the large valuation allowance currently established.
Under ASC 740, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. The adoption had no effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue from renting its fleet of cars to ridesharing and delivery gig drivers. Revenue is recognized based on the rental agreements which are generally on a weekly basis. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers.
We consider a signed contract or other similar documentation reflecting the terms and conditions under which products will be provided to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement. Collectability is assessed based on a number of factors, including payment history and the creditworthiness of a customer. If it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured, revenue is not recognized until collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. FASB ASC Topic 718 requires companies to measure compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation at fair value at the grant date and recognize the expense over the employee’s requisite service period. The Company recognizes in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees and non-employees.
Contingencies
Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company’s management, in consultation with its legal counsel as appropriate, assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company, in consultation with legal counsel, evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims, as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable, but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss, if determinable and material, would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.
