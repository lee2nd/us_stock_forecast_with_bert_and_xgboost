Overview
We are engaged in the development and sale of alcohol and non-alcohol brands that are “better-for-you” (“BFY”) and “better-for-the-planet”. TopPop, our wholly owned subsidiary, produces low calorie, “ready to go” products, ready-to-freeze (“RTF”) products and ready-to-drink (“RTD”) products in sustainable, flexible and stand-up pouch packaging. TopPop is also a leader in the “cocktails-to-go” pouches and alcohol ice-pop market. Our brands include “Bellissima” by Christie Brinkley, a premium BFY collection of Prosecco, Sparkling Wines, and Still Wines, all certified vegan and made with organic grapes. Bellissima is strategically positioned with its Zero Sugar Wines. We operate in multiple states, sell and distribute across the globe and have Fortune 500 customers that include some of the world’s largest alcohol beverage companies and brands. United Distributors, Inc., (“United”) is our 100% owned subsidiary which sells our Bellissima, Bella, Sonja Sangria and other alcohol beverages to state distributors. United holds all applicable state and federal licenses in order to sell these products to state distributors in accordance with the United States three tier distribution platform.
We have expertise in developing, from product inception to wholesale distribution or direct to consumer through the QVC distribution channel, and in branding alcohol beverages for our company and for third parties. We market and place products into national distribution through long-standing industry relationships approximately 45 national or regional alcoholic beverage distributors. We currently market and sell the following product lines:
·
Bellissima Prosecco - these products comprise a line of all-natural and vegan Prosecco and Sparkling Wines made with organic grapes, including a Zero Sugar, Zero Carb option, a DOC Brut and a Sparkling Rose. The Bellissima line of Prosecco and Sparkling Wines includes two new flavor profiles, a Zero Sugar/Zero Carb Sparkling Rose and a Rose Prosecco;
·
Bellissima Zero Sugar Still Wines - this line of five still wines was launched in March 2022 and are certified vegan and are made with organic grapes.
·
Bella Sprizz Aperitifs - these products comprise a line of aperitifs consisting of three different expressions, a classic Italian aperitif, an all-natural elderflower aperitif and a classic Italian bitter;
·
Ready-to-Freeze and Ready-to-Drink Alcoholic Products - these products are currently produced under contract for third-party national and regional brands and for our Boozy Pops® product line; and
·
BiVi Vodka - a celebrity-branded vodka that we have sold since 2018 under the brand “BiVi 100 percent Sicilian Vodka” and which currently does not represent a material portion of our sales.
In addition, we develop and market private label spirits for established domestic and international chains.
As a result of our July 2021 acquisition of 100% of the equity of TopPop, we are now a vertically integrated company for the development, production and distribution of alcoholic brands. TopPop is a premier product development, contract manufacturing and packaging company that specializes in flexible packaging applications in the food, beverage and health categories. It has the federal and state licenses necessary to manufacture and blend malt, wine and spirits-based products. In June 2020, TopPop opened a 27,000-square-foot FDA-approved manufacturing facility in Marlton, New Jersey with a Safe Quality Food certification. In September 2021, TopPop leased an additional 65,000 square feet facility for manufacturing in Pennsauken, New Jersey. Construction is now complete, and the facility reached full-scale production capability at the end of March 2022. The facility includes approximately $4 million of high-speed packaging equipment and is expected to triple our production capacity.
For its first product line, TopPop identified the single serve, RTD and RTF as ripe for product and packaging innovation. TopPop introduced an alcohol-infused ice pop in June 2020 and began marketing the concept to major alcohol companies. In addition, it developed its own product line trademarked under the name BoozyPopz® which is expected to be sold through e-commerce platforms and wholesaled directly to sports and entertainment venues. TopPop manufactured approximately 8 million ice pops from its launch in June 2020 through December 31, 2020 and manufactured approximately 42 million ice pops during the year ended December 31, 2021. TopPop has also developed a pipeline for the single serve, RTD alcohol cocktail market and anticipates launching a line of products in this market in 2022. TopPop designs and markets flexible packaging for its RTD and RTF products with formulations that are low calorie and contain healthy and natural ingredients. With the opening of TopPop’s new facility at the end of the first quarter of 2022, we expect to have the capacity to manufacture over 150 million units in 2022.
We believe TopPop brings to us additional synergies and opportunities for cross-promoting new and existing products to a broader customer base and better positions our company to establish and support our brands and to create sustainable packaging solutions to the consumable goods market. We believe our focus on lifestyle branding and the rising “Better-for-You,” “Better-for-the-Planet” consumer categories has made us a leader in developing celebrity brands worldwide, such as our Bellissima Prosecco by Christie Brinkley. Our mission is to be an industry leader in the brand development, marketing and sales of alcoholic beverages and related products by capitalizing on our ability to procure products from around the world and to develop unique and innovative packaging to create brand and product line extensions. We plan to leverage our relationships to add value to our products and to create brand awareness in unbranded niche categories.
Recent Developments
COVID-19
As a result of COVID-19, we have seen a shift away from the traditional brick-and-mortar business to a direct-to-consumer business. Although we expect brick-and-mortar to rebound, we also expect the director-to-consumer model to stay post-COVID-19, as consumers embrace the convenience of having their alcoholic beverages delivered to their doorstep. As we expand our relationship with QVC and our own direct-to-consumer platform through our website, we believe we are well positioned to execute on this opportunity.
TopPop Acquisition
On July 26, 2021, we completed the acquisition of TopPop. In connection with such acquisition, the former TopPop members received, in the aggregate(a) $3,694,273 in cash, net of cash acquired, by transfer of immediately available funds, (b) 26,009,600 shares of our common stock, which shares were valued in the aggregate at $10,143,744, or $0.39 per share, (c) $5,042,467 aggregate principal amount of our promissory notes and (d) future additional payments as earnout consideration valued at $20,204,505 to be paid in cash and stock. The earn-out payments, if any, will be made (i) following the 12-month period commencing on August 1, 2021, in an aggregate amount equal to the excess, if any, of: (A) 1.96 times TopPop’s EBITDA for the period over (B) the aggregate amount of the closing promissory notes repaid in cash during period; provided, however, no such amount shall be payable if (i)(A) does not exceed (i)(B); and (ii) following the 12-month period commencing on August 1, 2022, in an aggregate amount equal to the excess, if any, of: (A) 1.96 times TopPop’s EBITDA for such period over (B) the aggregate amount of the closing promissory notes repaid in cash during the period; provided, however, no such amount shall be payable if (ii)(A) does not exceed (ii)(B). The earn-out payments will be made, at the election of each former TopPop member, in cash or in shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, less any reserve for possible indemnification payments, provided that not less than 45% of the value of each earn-out payment shall be paid in common stock. If paid in shares of common stock, such shares shall be valued at the then-prevailing market rate.
Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock Financing
On July 26, 2021, we entered into securities purchase agreements dated as of July 26, 2021 with certain accredited investors for the sale of our newly-created Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series A-2 Preferred Stock”), shares of common stock, and warrants to purchase shares of common stock.
Pursuant to the purchase agreements, the shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock, common stock and warrants were sold in two tranches, the first of which closed on July 26, 2021 for gross proceeds of $18,372,354 for the sale of an aggregate of 18,800 shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock, an aggregate of 6,711,997 shares of common stock, and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 73,338,203 shares of common stock.

Such net proceeds are expected to be used by the Company for domestic and international expansion of its Bellissima brand, the expansion of the production facilities of the Company’s TopPop subsidiary, new product launches, marketing, and other general working capital purposes.
The warrants are exercisable for a period of five years from the date of issuance at an exercise price of $0.3125 per share. The Warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis if the shares of common stock underlying the warrants are not then registered for resale pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act.

Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Introduction
We had sales of $4,960,016 and $2,848,913 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our cost of sales was $4,628,734 and $1,330,441 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our operating expenses were $10,592,867 and $4,716,564, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our operating expenses consisted mostly of salaries, professional fees, royalties and fulfilment costs along with marketing and advertising costs, occupancy costs, and travel and entertainment.
Revenues and Net Operating Loss
Our revenues, operating expenses, and net operating loss for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:
Sales
Our sales are comprised of sales of BiVi Sicilian Vodka, Bellissima Prosecco and Sparkling Wine, the line of Hooters brand products and our RTF TopPop products. Sales were $4,960,016 and $2,848,913 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which resulted in an increase of $2,111,103 or approximately 74%. The increase was due primarily to $2,192,119 sales from our newly acquired TopPop products.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales was $4,628,734, or approximately 93% of sales, and $1,330,441, or approximately 47% of sales, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cost of sales includes the cost of the products purchased from our suppliers, freight-in costs and import duties. Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 for our alcohol sales was approximately 51% of sales, which was similar to the prior year, while the costs associated with our TopPop acquisition were approximately 151% of sales. The increase was due to TopPop increased costs of production since July 25, 2021 from (i) significant labor costs and scrap costs from a large rework of a customer order due to an isolated error in blending of batched raw materials and lot coding by a vendor of TopPop, (ii) write down of perishable inventory as the summer production season wound down and a customer who ended production early who would not reimburse TopPop for unused raw materials. The targeted cost of goods for TopPop products is approximately 51% and we expect to achieve that margin in future years. Four semi-automated cartoning machines were purchased by TopPop to significantly reduce labor costs and will be installed during 1st quarter 2022 and the referenced batching and coding errors by the vendor have been process corrected and approved by the customer.
Officers Compensation
Officers’ compensation was $627,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $415,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase of $212,000 was due to bonus payments and additional compensation for new officers.
Fulfillment Costs
Fulfillment costs were $287,466 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $536,255 for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease of $248,789 was primarily due to lower QVC sales in 2021.
Professional and Consulting Fees
Professional and consulting fees were $2,874,968 for the year ended December 31, 2021, and $962,481 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $1,912,487. Professional and consulting fees consist primarily of legal and, accounting services. The increase from 2020 to 2021 was primarily related to additional expenses of approximately $1.6 million from the newly acquired TopPop in 2021.
Royalties and Gain from Cancellation of Accrued Royalties
We accrued royalty expenses of $160,119 and recognized a gain from the cancellation of royalties of $577,590 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to expenses of $497,253 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Royalties decreased due primarily to the cancellation of accrued, but unpaid, royalties as part of the amended licensing agreement with Hooters signed in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Selling and Marketing
Selling and Marketing expenses were $716,727 and $801,445 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which was a decrease of $84,718, or 11%. Decrease is primarily due to the concentration of operating expenses towards the acquisition of TopPop in 2021 rather than on marketing activities. We expect marketing expenses to increase somewhat in 2022.
Travel and Entertainment
Travel and entertainment expenses were $194,785 and $41,208 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $153,577, or 373%, between the periods. The increase was a result of limited travel during the year ended December 31, 2020, due to the COVID-19 environment. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our personnel attended numerous product development events.
Other Operating Expenses
Other operating expenses were $6,309,392 and $1,462,922 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $4,846,470, or 373%, between the periods. The increase was primarily related to amortization of intangibles of approximately $1,300,000, payroll costs of approximately $2,200,000, equity based compensation to employees of approximately $891,000 and rent expense of 424,523. Payroll costs have increased due to hiring additional personnel and with the acquisition of TopPop in 2021.
Net Operating Loss
We had a loss from operations of $10,261,585 for the year ended December 31, 2021, and $3,198,092 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $7,063,493 or approximately 221%. Net operating loss increased as set forth above.
Other Income (Expense)
We had other nonoperating expenses of $243,291 for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to interest expense of $271,749, while we had a loss on investment in and receivable from Can B Corp of $483,472 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Net (income) Loss attributable to Noncontrolling Interests in Subsidiaries
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries represented 49% of the net income of Bellissima and BiVi (of which we own 51%) and is accounted for as a increase in the net loss attributable to us. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $40,882 compared to net loss of $109,962 for the year ended December 31, 2020. With the acquisition of United, there is no longer a noncontrolling interest associated with this entity, as it is now a 100%-owned subsidiary, see note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Net Loss Attributable to Iconic Brands, Inc.
The net loss attributable to Iconic Brands, Inc. was $10,463,994 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $3,571,602 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $6,892,392 or approximately 193%. The net loss from Iconic Brands increased primarily because of the items described above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Introduction
During the year ended December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, we had negative operating cash flows. Our cash on hand as of December 31, 2021, was $2,190,814. During 2021, cash used in operations was $4,090,659. Of the equity financing that we entered into on July 26, 2021, the Company received approximately $15.6 million, net of fees, from the first tranche and approximately $10.8 million, net of fees, from the second tranche which closed on January 5, 2022. With the funding of the second tranche of the equity financing, we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our operations in the near term.
Going Concern
Our cash, current assets, total assets, current liabilities, and total liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, are as follows:
Our cash increased $1,733,773 and total current assets increased $3,047,004 because of our equity financing and acquisition of TopPop, respectively. Our total current liabilities increased $13,467,894 primarily because of the current portion of contingent consideration, notes payable issued to the former owners of TopPop as consideration in the acquisition and operating lease liabilities from the warehouses that TopPop leases. Our total liabilities increased $28,410,586 as a result of recognition of contingent payments associated with the TopPop acquisition of $20,204,505. Our stockholders’ equity increased from a deficit of $1,828,123 to an equity balance of $19,113,055 due primarily to the issuance of stock associated with the TopPop acquisition and the equity financing.
In order to repay our obligations in full or in part when due, we may be required to raise significant capital from other sources and to execute on our business plans for TopPop. There is no assurance, however, that we will be successful in these efforts. Please see the Risk Factors beginning on page 12 of this Annual Report Form 10-K.
Cash Requirements
Our cash on hand as of December 31, 2021 was $2,190,814. On January 5, 2022, the Company closed the second tranche of the equity financing and sold 12,257 shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock, 4,781,004 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 40,018,583 shares of common stock for approximately $10.8 million, net of fees. Such net proceeds are expected to be used by the Company for domestic and international expansion of its Bellissima brand, the expansion of the production facilities of the Company’s TopPop subsidiary, new product launches, marketing, and other general working capital purposes. We anticipate that the funding from financing activities and product sales will be enough to sustain us for the next 12 months from the date of this filing.
