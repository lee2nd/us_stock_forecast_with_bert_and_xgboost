Additionally, the information provided is expected to better allow investors to view the registrant from management’s perspective including using quarterly data supporting management’s discussion. In 2021, we were focused on execution, while managing the continued challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Business Overview
The aviation and aerospace industries as well as markets for the Company’s consumer products continually face evolving challenges on a global basis. The operations of the Company can be affected by the trends of the economy, including interest rates, income tax laws, government regulation, legislation, and other factors. In addition, uncertainties in today’s global economy, competition from expanding manufacturing capabilities and technical sophistication of low-cost developing countries and emerging markets, currency policies in relation to the U.S. dollar of some major foreign exporting countries, the effect of terrorism, difficulty in predicting defense and other government appropriations, the vitality of the commercial aviation industry and its ability to purchase new aircraft, the willingness and ability of the Company’s customers to fund long-term purchase programs, volatile market demand and the continued market acceptance of the Company’s advanced technology and cutlery products make it difficult to predict the impact on future financial results.
Both the ATG and CPG markets are sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and policies, which may create volatility in operating results from period to period. For example, the airline industry is sensitive to fuel price increases and economic conditions. These factors directly impact the demand for aircraft production as well as the amount of repair and overhaul required on in-service aircraft.
The Company’s suppliers are also subject to all the pressures and volatility being generated by the current global economic conditions. Any interruption of the Company’s continuous flow of material and product parts that are required for the manufacture of the Company’s products could adversely impact the Company’s ability to meet the Company’s customers’ delivery requirements. Consistent with the evolving requirements of the aerospace industry, companies are increasingly being requested to operate under long-term agreements with their customers on the basis of fixed prices, targeted year to year price reductions and/or year to year price adjustments predicated on mutually agreed indices and/or a combination of some or all of the above described pricing arrangements and/or otherwise. Therefore, productivity improvements and cost containment strategies are continuously sought within the Company’s concept of continuous improvement. The Company’s products are labor intensive and as such productivity improvements are expected to have positive effects on the Company’s operating results. However, increased costs for raw material, purchased parts and/or labor will have the reverse effect.
If any adverse economic events reduce the number of Airliners and/or Aircraft being produced by the Company’s relevant prime contractors, the negative effects of that reduction will in turn flow down through the supply chain. Also, certain major manufacturers have successfully imposed extended payment terms to their suppliers. At times, these extended payment terms are not available to the Company when purchasing raw material such as aluminum, magnetic material, steel and/or other product support items and services. If the Company’s customers delay their payments until after the extended due date or fail to pay, it could adversely impact the Company’s operating results.
Maximizing the Company’s operations and resources requires continued dedicated performances from the Company’s key and other personnel. In the Company’s markets and business arenas there is substantial competition for the services of the highest performing individuals. Competitors, customers and other companies who may have interest in the Company’s most experienced and educated/highly trained personnel (i.e., managerial, engineering and accounting/administrative) are a continuing consequence of the Company’s history of successful operational performance. Any unplanned replacement of such personnel may require the hiring of new personnel on an expedited basis (provided they are available) and may temporarily interrupt the Company’s operations and efforts for continuous improvement.
Management Discussion
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, approximately 78% and 82%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated revenues were derived from the ATG sale of product to a small base of customers. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, approximately 22% and 18% of the Company’s consolidated revenues were derived from the CPG sale of product to a large base of retail customers. There was a decrease in revenue in 2021 from 2020 of approximately $9,105,000 at the ATG and approximately $181,000 at the CPG.
The Company’s commercial business is affected by such factors as uncertainties in today’s global economy, global competition, the vitality and ability of the commercial aviation industry to purchase new aircraft, the effects and threats of terrorism, market demand and acceptance both for the Company’s products and its customers’ products which incorporate Company made components. The ATG engages its business development efforts in its primary markets and is broadening its activities to include new domestic and foreign markets that are consistent with its core competencies. We believe our business remains particularly well positioned in the strong commercial aircraft market driven by the replacement of older aircraft with more fuel efficient alternatives and the recovery of demand for air travel. Although the ATG backlog continues to be strong, actual scheduled shipments may be delayed/changed as a function of the Company’s customers’ final delivery determinations based on changes in the global economy and other factors.

Results of Operations
The following table compares the Company’s consolidated statements of income data for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 ($000’s omitted).
Revenue and Gross Margin
Revenue
The Company’s consolidated revenues from operations decreased approximately $9,286,000 or (18.6)% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2021 when compared to the same period in 2020. This is due to a decrease at both the ATG of approximately $9,105,000 or (22.3)% and at the CPG of approximately $181,000 or (2.0)%.
The consolidated decrease for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2021 when compared to the same twelve month period ended December 31, 2020 is attributable primarily to a decrease in units shipped at the ATG of approximately $10,189,000 offset by an increase in price/mix of units shipped of approximately $1,084,000. Throughout 2021 the ATG experienced a gradual increase in revenues, quarter over quarter sequentially, with a slight drop in the last three months ended December 31, 2021. Despite the slight drop in the last three months of 2021, the ATG revenues increased approximately 8.3% over the same three month period in 2020.
Additionally, there was a decrease in shipments at the CPG of approximately $410,000 offset by an increase in price/mix of units shipped of approximately $229,000. The CPG experienced an increase in revenues of approximately 8.1% for the first nine months of 2021 as compared to the same nine month period in 2020, with an approximate 22.0% decrease in revenues during the remaining three month period ending December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to the push-out of revenue due to contractual terms.
Gross Margin
The Company’s consolidated gross margins from operations decreased approximately $2,252,000 or (27.3)% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2021 when compared to the same period in 2020.
The ATG gross margin decreased in the twelve month period due to an increase in the costs per units shipped of approximately $1,840,000 partially offset by the price increases of those units shipped of approximately $1,084,000, as mentioned above. The gross margin also decreased approximately $2,534,000 due to the decrease in the number of units shipped at the ATG. The gross margin improved by approximately $1,696,000 due to the mix of the units produced and sold in the twelve month period ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same time period in 2020.
Additionally, the CPG gross margin decreased in the twelve month period due to an increase in the costs per units shipped of approximately $1,627,000 partially offset by the price increases of those units shipped of approximately $229,000, as mentioned above. The gross margin also decreased approximately $67,000 due to the decrease in the number of units shipped at the CPG. The gross margin improved by approximately $807,000 due to the mix of the units produced and sold in the twelve month period ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same time period in 2020.
Since mid-2020, both Segments have experienced the challenge of fully utilizing their production resources, increasing the cost per unit produced. Additionally, the increased costs of raw materials and shipping costs associated with the production of our products have increased the costs per unit. The Segments have been closely monitoring all other purchases.
As the ATG revenue volume increases it is expected that the utilization of the production resources will improve and improve gross margin percentages similar to the first half of 2020. Since the ATG has production at both the Elma and Franklinville facilities, we also expect to see improvement in the CPG gross margin percentages.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses and Operating Income
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) increased approximately $3,315,000 or 41.4% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2021 when compared to the same period in 2020. SG&A expenses at the ATG increased approximately $3,216,000 or 51.5%. The increase is due to a legal settlement of approximately $1,800,000, as previously disclosed; legal fees of approximately $1,508,000 and professional fees of approximately $598,000 offset by a decrease of employee wages and benefits of approximately $833,000. There was a net increase of all other ATG SG&A expenses of approximately $143,000 as compared to the same period in 2020. In addition, SG&A expenses at the CPG increased approximately $99,000 or 5.6%. The increase is due to a legal settlement of approximately $90,000, as previously disclosed and employee wages and benefits of approximately $138,000 offset by a decrease of assessed support from the ATG of approximately $103,000. There was a net decrease of approximately $26,000 of all other CPG SG&A expenses as compared to the same period in 2020.
In 2021, both Segments experienced an increase in SG&A as a percentage of revenues. Management expects the ATG SG&A percentage to revenue to drop significantly, when adjusted for nonrecurring legal settlement costs, legal fees and professional fees, in conjunction with the anticipated increase of revenue volume. The CPG SG&A percentage to revenue is not expected to improve significantly, except for adjusting for nonrecurring legal settlement costs.
Operating Losses
Losses from operations increased approximately $5,567,000 or (2300.4%) when comparing the twelve month period ended December 31, 2021 to the same period in 2020. Operating losses increased at both the ATG and CPG approximately $4,810,000 and $757,000, respectively, as compared to the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020. Operating losses for the three months ended December 31, 2021 at the ATG slightly improved by approximately $171,000 partially offset by additional operating losses at the CPG by approximately $127,000 as compared to the same time period in 2020.
The consolidated increase in operating losses is primarily the result in the decreases in revenue and increases in SG&A expenditures, as discussed above.
Other Income:
ERC and PPP loan forgiveness
As previously discussed, the Company evaluated its eligibility for the employee retention credit. It was determined that the Company qualified for the ERC for all quarters allowed under the Federal Government programs. As a result, the Company recognized approximately $5,622,000 on a consolidated basis, for the period ended December 31, 2021.
In addition, on September 24, 2021 the Small Business Administration notified the Company that the full amount of the PPP loan was forgiven. The amount of $4,000,000 was recorded in other income.
By participating in state and federal programs the ATG was able to avoid an involuntary reduction in workforce and maintain production for ontime delivery to our customers.
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased approximately $7,000 or 3.9% primarily due to the line of credit and equipment financing lease obligations at the ATG for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. See also Note 4, Long-Term Debt, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on long-term debt.
Income Taxes
The Company’s effective tax rate for operations was (1.1)% in 2021 and (61.3)% in 2020. The effective tax rate reflects federal and state income taxes, permanent non-deductible expenditures, non-taxable PPP loan foregiveness income, the deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (FDII), and the federal tax credit for research and development expenditures. The increase in the effective tax rate between 2020 and 2021 is a result of a decrease in the ratio of tax benefits to net income before taxes. See also Note 6, Income Taxes, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information concerning income taxes.
Net Income
Net income for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2021 increased approximately $3,955,000 or 3955.0% when compared to the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020. Net income at the ATG was higher by approximately $4,075,000 while the net loss at the CPG increased by approximately $120,000. The consolidated increase is primarily the result of the consolidated operating losses offset by the ERC and the PPP forgiveness, as discussed earlier.
Liquidity and Capital Resources:
(1) NET OF PROCEEDS FROM SALE OF EQUIPMENT AND EQUIPMAENT FINANCING
Operating Activities:
The Company generated approximately $4,591,000 in cash from operations during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2021 as compared to generating approximately $826,000 for the same period in 2020. At December 31, 2021, the Company had working capital of approximately $34,067,000 ($31,074,000 - December 2020) of which approximately $9,546,000 ($5,935,000 - December 2020) was comprised of cash.
The increase in working capital is primarily attributable to an increase in net income partially offset by adjustments to reconcile net income to cash generated of approximately $958,000. In addition, there was a decrease of inventory at the ATG of approximately $3,252,000. The Company continues to focus on inventory management in light of this period of uncertainty with respect to short and
long-term industry demand. The balances of all other operating accounts were a net increase to working capital of approximately $381,000.
The Company’s cash flow from operations and available line of credit capacity provide the Company with the financial resources needed to run the Company’s operations and reinvest in its business. The Company’s ability to maintain sufficient liquidity is highly dependent upon achieving expected operating results. Failure to achieve expected operating results could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity, its ability to obtain financing, and our operations in the future.
Investing Activities:
The Company generated approximately $3,000 in cash from investing activities during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2021 as compared to a usage of cash of approximately $729,000 during the same period in 2020. Cash was generated primarily through the sale of equipment. The sale of the equipment was due to the lower return on investment achieve than initially expected when purchased.
Financing Activities:
The Company’s primary usage of cash in its financing activities in the twelve month period ended December 31, 2021 include the principal payments on long-term debt and equipment financing obligations of approximately $1,786,000 partially offset by proceeds from equipment financing and proceeds from the line of credit of approximately $884,000. Approximately $81,000 was used for the purchase of treasury shares to satisfy tax obligations for the employee vested restricted stock shares.
As of March 20, 2020, the Company increased its line of credit from $4,000,000 to $6,000,000. As of July 31, 2020, the Company extended the line of credit from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022. On January 11, 2022, the Company executed an amendment to the loan agreement, which extended the line of credit availability period from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023. The amended agreement suspended the Debt Service Coverage Ratio loan covenant up through and including the third quarter of 2022. A Quarterly Minimum Cash Flow measurement loan covenant replaced the Debt Service Coverage Ratio loan covenant. Minimum Cash Flow means net income, plus depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense, plus interest expense, plus non-cash expense related to the Servotronics, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan, plus non-cash stock and stock option transactions.
Through the third quarter of 2022, the amended agreement requires the Company to maintain a minimum liquidity, defined as cash on hand plus line of credit availability of at least $9,000,000.
The interest rate is a rate per year equal to the sum of (i) the greater of the Bloomberg’s Short-Term Bank Yield (BSBY) Daily Floating Rate or the Index Floor, plus (ii) 1.65 percentage point(s). For purposes of this paragraph, “Index Floor” means 0.5 percent.
The line of credit is secured by all personal property of the Company with the exception of certain equipment that was purchased from proceeds of government grants. There was $4,250,000 balance outstanding at December 31, 2021 and $3,750,000 balance at December 31, 2020. The phase out of LIBOR and transition to the BSBY Daily Floating Rate is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s operating results, financial position, or cash flows as the only outstanding debt is the line of credit.
The Company had an equipment loan facility in the amount of $1,000,000 available until July 9, 2021. This line was non-revolving and non-renewable. The loan term for the equipment covered by the agreement is 60 months. Monthly payments are fixed for the term of each funding based upon the Lender’s lease pricing in effect at the time of such funding. There is approximately $712,000 outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and $534,000 outstanding at December 31, 2020.
On April 21, 2020, the Company executed a promissory note (the “Note”) in the amount of $4,000,000 as part of the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP Loan”) administered by the Small Business Administration (the “SBA”) and authorized under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act”). The PPP Loan was made through the Bank of America, NA (the “Lender”). The term of the PPP Loan was two years with an annual interest rate of 1.00%. Payments of principal and interest on the PPP Loan were deferred until the SBA remits the loan forgiveness amount to the lender. The Company used approximately 60% of the amount of the PPP Loan proceeds to pay for payroll costs and the balance on other eligible qualifying expenses consistent with the terms of the PPP and submitted its forgiveness application to the Lender during the third quarter of 2021. During the third quarter, the
entire loan was forgiven by the SBA and a gain of $4,000,000 was recorded in “Other income (expense)” in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.
Management believes that it should retain the capital generated from operating activities for investment in research and development and programs to retain the Company’s human resources talent. Accordingly, there are no plans to institute a cash dividend within the next year.
The Company believes its cash generating capability and financial condition, together with available credit facilities will be adequate to meet our future operating and investing needs.
The COVID-19 pandemic could impact our liquidity. Lower production schedules, possible inability of our customers to make timely payments to us, and similar factors could lower cash generated from operations and adversely affect our financial position.

Critical Accounting Policies
The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). As such, the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Note 1, Business Description and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
