ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION
Management's Discussion and Analysis
The following selected financial data was derived from the Company's audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements. The information set forth below should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this registration statement. In addition, upon completion of the Evasyst Acquisition, of which there is no assurance, the Company expects to focus its resources on the development of Evasyst's video streaming business and the Company's own Gaming business. These businesses are significantly different from the domain name and web development business that the Company has historically been engaged in. As a result, historical results and capital requirements are not expected to be reflective of the Company's financial results and capital requirements moving forward.
Summary of Results
Results of Operation
Revenue
The Company recognized a gain of $913,246 from the sale of a domain name during the year ended December 31, 2021 (2020 - $117,466). The Company did not recognize recurring revenues during its 2021 or 2020 fiscal years. The Company continues to market its domain names in its portfolio and considers offers received for domain names in its portfolio. The Company believes its portfolio of domain names will continue to maintain its value over time. The Company does not anticipate earning significant advertising revenue from SPRT MTRX or Trivia Matrix in the 2022 fiscal year.
The Company has an accumulated deficit of $17,888,257 at December 31, 2021. The Company is presently in the development stage of its business and cannot provide any assurances that it will be able to generate regular or recurring revenues in the near future.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $639,735 as compared to $283,775 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of approximately $356,000. The change is mainly due to an increase in development costs associated with Trivia Matrix and an increase in marketing activities and impairment expense related to SPRT MTRX.
Net Loss
The Company recorded a net loss of $150,615 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and net profit of $231,999 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The majority of the difference is the result of two transactions as follows: During the year ended December 31, 2021 the Company had a net gain of $913,246 from the sale of domain names compared to a net gain of $117,466 in the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2021 the equity investment resulting from the sale of the eBalance distribution rights described below decreased in value by $346,253 compared to an increase of $47,147 in 2020. In addition, in 2020 the Company recorded a one time gain on the sale of a licence related to the eBalance distribution rights transaction of $351,134. And in 2021 the Company recorded $95,722 in stock based compensation relating to the issuance of options to management, directors and consultants.
On January 29, 2020, the Company made the decision to exit the medical device distribution business and agreed to sell back to Cell MedX Corp. ("Cell MedX") the exclusive worldwide distribution rights to Cell MedX's eBalance microcurrent device, acquired in 2019 (the "Distribution Rights"). Under the terms of the agreement, the Company sold the Distribution Rights back to Cell MedX in consideration for a royalty on future sales of the eBalance device capped at US$507,500, plus warrants to purchase up to 2,000,000 shares in the common stock of Cell MedX (the "Warrants") exercisable for a period of three (3) years. 1,000,000 of the Warrants are exercisable at a price of $US0.50 per share (the "$0.50 Warrants"), with the remaining 1,000,000 Warrants exercisable at US$1.00 per share (the "$1.00 Warrants"). The Warrants are subject to an acceleration right, with the $0.50 Warrants being subject to acceleration if Cell MedX's common stock trades at or above $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, and the $1.00 Warrants being subject to acceleration if Cell MedX's common stock trades at or above $1.75 per share for 30 consecutive trading days.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2021, the Company had a working capital surplus of $566,159, compared to $41,938 at December 31, 2020. The Company's only source of cashflow during the year ended December 31, 2021 was through the sale of domain names totaling $913,246. Due to the fact that the Company has incurred recurring losses and anticipates incurring further losses in the future, the Company has determined there is substantial doubt as to its ability to continue as a going concern.
In February 2022, the Company completed the February 2022 Convertible Note Offering for gross proceeds of $1,500,000, and in March 2022, the Company completed the March 2022 Convertible Note Offering for gross proceeds of $886,000. See "Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities" for additional details regarding the February 2022 Convertible Note Offering and the March 2022 Convertible Note Offering.
The Company does not anticipate purchasing any plant or significant equipment in the immediate future.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company has no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to shareholders.
Critical Accounting Policies
Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the SEC did not, or are not believed by management to, have a material impact on the Company's present or future financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
