Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes, and other financial information included in this Form 10-K.
Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking. Words such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “potential,” “believes,” “seeks,” “hopes,” “estimates,” “should,” “may,” “will,” “with a view to” and variations of these words or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national, and local general economic and market conditions; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; change in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; the risk of foreign currency exchange rates; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Although the forward-looking statements in this Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects.
Overview
Our Company is a provider of health and nutritional supplements and personal care products. Currently, we are mainly selling our products over the internet directly to end-user customers through our website, at www.merionus.com, and to wholesale distributors through phone and electronic communication. Our major customers of our nutritional and beauty products are located in the Asian market, predominantly in the People’s Republic of China. Our major customers of our OEM and packaging products are located in the United States.
Since June 2014, we have been selling our products primarily over the internet directly to end-user customers and by phone/email orders directly to our wholesale distributors. Certain miscellaneous sales are made directly to customers who walk into the Company offices and customers who call the Company directly for products. We are now focusing on selling health and nutritional supplements and personal care products directly on the internet through our website at www.merionus.com and to our OEM and packaging customers. As of the date of this report, we market eight individual nutritional supplement products, three and five of which were introduced in 2018 and 2019 respectively, and one beauty product, which was also introduced in 2018, on our website. We are no longer selling similar products of third parties on our website.
In January 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with SUSS Technology Corporation, a Nevada corporation (the “Seller”), pursuant to which the Seller agreed to sell to the Company substantially all of the assets associated with the Seller’s manufacture of dietary supplements (the “Nevada Factory”) for an aggregate purchase price (the “Purchase Price”) of $1,000,000 and 333,334 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Purchase Shares”) valued at $320,000. The Seller was one of our major suppliers during the year ended December 31, 2017. Upon purchasing these assets from the Seller, we started to manufacture some of the nutritional supplements that we sold until May 2021. In May 2021, we determined that it would be more beneficial to outsource to third-party manufacturers the production of our branded and OEM products rather than manufacturing through our Nevada Factory. As a result, we disposed of our factory machinery and terminated our Nevada Factory lease in May 2021. As we have significant continuing involvement in the sale of our branded and OEM products through our third-party manufacturers, this restructuring did not constitute a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. Therefore, the results of operations for our Nevada Factory were not reported as discontinued operations under the guidance of FASB ASC 205.
In January 2018, we introduced a new beauty product, Noir Naturel, a gentle formula for grey coverage from the first application into hair care.
In September 2018, we introduced three different types of natural aphrodisiac supplements, Viwooba (1-3) for men that may support kidney health, improve immunity, enhance physical fitness, eliminate fatigue, improve sexual desire and enhance body energy, strength and sexual ability.
In March 2019, we introduced 1) Lady-S, a female dietary supplement that may assist with weight loss, 2) Gold King, a nutritional supplement that may provide antioxidant support and liver health, 3) New Power, a nutritional supplement that may support heart health, and 4) Taibao, a nutritional supplement that may enhance physical performance and energy metabolism.
In December 2019, we introduced ReMage Power, a nutritional supplement that may provide anti-aging Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ support and promote energy & cell metabolism.
On June 11, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of our common stock. On July 27, 2021, we filed a Certificate of Change with the State of Nevada (the “Certificate”) to effect a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of our authorized shares of common stock, par value $0.001 (the “Common Stock”), accompanied by a corresponding decrease in our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”), effective upon filing. Following the Reverse Stock Split, the number of authorized shares of Common Stock was reduced from 1,000,000,000 to 333,333,333. All shares and per share amounts (except for par value amount) used herein and in the accompanying financial statements have been retroactively restated to reflect the 1-for-3 Reverse Stock Split.
Principal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance
We believe consumers have become more confident in ordering products like ours over the internet. However, the nutritional supplement and skin care products e-commerce markets have been, and continue to be, increasingly competitive and are rapidly evolving due to the reasons discussed below.
Barriers to entry are minimal in the nutritional supplement and skin care businesses, and current and new competitors can launch new websites at a relatively low cost. Many competitors in this area have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Continued advancement in e-commerce, and increased access to online shopping, is paving the way for growth in direct marketing. We also face competition for consumers from retailers, duty-free retailers, specialty stores, department stores and specialty and general merchandise catalogs, many of which have greater financial and marketing resources than we have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we believe that we are well-positioned within the Asian consumer market with our current plan of supplying American merchandise to consumers in Asia. There can be no assurance that we will maintain or increase our competitive position or that we will continue to provide only American-made merchandise.
As COVID-19 has limited the global travels, transportation, and import and export of goods, we focused more on our local OEM and packaging business and it has become our major revenue source in fiscal year 2021. We manufactured these products through our Nevada Factory prior to May 2021 and subsequently we purchase the raw material for the products and outsource to the third-party manufacturers and packaging companies to produce and pack these products for our customers after we closed our Nevada Factory in May 2021. The loss of one or more of our U.S. OEM and packaging customers would result in a significant loss of sales and have a negative effect on our operations.
For the wholesale and retail customers who are looking for private label products, we provide our own formulas, purchase raw material and contract third party manufacturers to produce products. For the customers who have their own formulas, we purchase raw materials and outsource to the third-party manufacturers and packing companies for their products.
Our products are sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels, and demand tends to decline or grow more slowly during economic downturns, including downturns in any of our major markets. The global economy is currently undergoing a period of downturn due to COVID-19, and the future economic environment continues to remain uncertain. This has led, and could further lead, to reduced consumer spending, which may include spending on nutritional and beauty products and other discretionary items. The increase of trade tensions between US and China and the COVID-19 pandemic have and might continue to have negative impacts on our business. The reduced consumer spending may force us and our competitors to lower prices. These conditions may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.
Coronavirus (COVID-19)
At the end of 2019, there was an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) which has spread rapidly to many parts of China and other parts of the world, including the U.S. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The pandemic has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of office buildings and facilities in China and in the U.S. The economic impact of the coronavirus or COVID-19 in both China and the U.S have significantly impacted our business and results of operations.
Our headquarters are located in California and were closed from March 19, 2020 to June 9, 2020. Due to the surge of COVID-19 cases in California, our offices were closed again from July 16, 2020 to September 16, 2020 and our employees worked remotely from home during these periods. Our offices have been reopened since September 16, 2020. Substantially all of our product sales revenues are generated in China and all of our OEM and packaging revenues are generated in the U.S. Consequently, our results of operations have been and will continue to be materially adversely affected, to the extent that the pandemic harms the Chinese and U.S. economies. Any potential impact to our results will depend on, to a large extent, future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the duration and severity of the pandemic and new variants, efficacy and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and the actions taken by government authorities and other entities in China and U.S. to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, almost all of which are beyond our control.
Although we expect that our health supplement products and our OEM/packaging services will still be in demand due to awareness of the importance of health growing along with the realities of COVID-19, the global economy has been and may continue to be negatively affected by COVID-19 and there is continued uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the impact of COVID-19. Many of our customers are individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which may not have strong cash flows or be well capitalized, and may be vulnerable to a pandemic outbreak and slowing macroeconomic conditions. If the SMEs cannot weather the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic impact, or cannot resume business as usual after a prolonged outbreak, our revenues and business operations may be materially and adversely impacted.
While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing the Company’s ability to access capital, which could negatively affect the Company’s liquidity.
Substantially all of our revenues are concentrated in the United States. Consequently, the COVID-19 outbreak has and may continue to materially adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and operating results, including but not limited to the material negative impact to the sourcing of raw materials and delivery of our products, revenues and collection of accounts receivable and any additional bad debt expense. The situation remains highly uncertain for any further outbreak or resurgence of the COVID-19, new variants and the efficacy and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. It is therefore difficult for the Company to estimate the impact on our business or operating results that might be adversely affected by any further outbreak or resurgence of COVID-19 for 2022.
In addition, due to COVID-19 spreading around the world and some of the raw materials to produce our products are sourced from outside of the United States, the suppliers have been and might continue to be negatively impacted due to supply chain disruption, increased shipping costs and shortage of raw materials. Consequently, the COVID-19 outbreak has and may continue to materially adversely affect the Company’s business operations, financial condition and operating results for 2022, including but not limited to the shortage of raw materials, delay of shipment, and increased prices for the Company’s products manufactured by our suppliers.
The Company started to recover as total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 were higher as compared to the same period of 2020. Because of the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, the financial impact for 2022 cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
Looking ahead, we understand that these unprecedented times will have a financial impact on some of our customers, and might potentially cause us loss of certain existing customers. Our plan has been to promote the awareness of the importance of health and our health supplement products, which in turn might build sales with new customers to offset the loss of any of our existing customers.
As COVID-19 continues to impact global business, the U.S. government established relief programs for small business such as the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program (“EIDL”). In 2020, we received a PPP loan of $131,100 and EIDL loan of $150,000 to help fund our operation in 2020. The PPP loan was fully forgiven by the SBA administration in January 2021.
On February 2, 2021, the Company received loan proceeds of $137,792 under the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) second round of Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) to help fund our operations in 2021. The PPP loan was fully forgiven by the SBA administration in October 2021.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Total sales increased by approximately $1,042,000 or 237.3%, from approximately $439,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020 to approximately $1,481,000 in the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase of sales was mainly due to the OEM contracts that the Company signed in 2020 and we fulfilled approximately $1.3 million of the orders during the year ended December 31, 2021 with approximately $0.9 million unfilled as of December 31, 2021
The cost of sales increased by approximately $581,000, or 127.8%, from approximately $454,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020 to approximately $1,035,000 in the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase of cost of sales was in line with the increase of revenue as we fulfilled our OEM orders during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Our overall gross margin (loss) percentage increased from a gross loss of approximately (3.5)% in the year ended December 31, 2020 to a gross margin of approximately 30.1% in the year ended December 31, 2021, mainly due to the increase of sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. We had more sales to absorb our fixed production costs during the year ended December 31, 2021 as our products normally have high gross margins. In May 2021, we determined that it is more beneficial to outsource to third-party manufacturers the production of our branded and OEM products rather than manufacturing through our Nevada Factory. As a result, we closed our Nevada Factory, disposed its assets and terminated its lease in May 2021, which also contributed to a higher gross margin in 2021 because we had more idle manufacturing capacity cost for our Nevada factory during the same period in 2020 which had driven down our gross margin.
Our product sales decreased by approximately $27,000, or 38.0% from $69,735 for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $43,217 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The gross margin percentage decreased from approximately 48.8% in the year ended December 31, 2020 to approximately 30.7% in the year ended December 31, 2021. The reason for the decrease of gross margin percentage was due to providing more discounts to our customers during the year ended December 31, 2021 on some of our products that were closer to the expiration date as compared to the same period in 2020.
Our OEM and packaging sales increased by approximately $1,069,000, or 289.3% from approximately $369,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 to approximately $1,438,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The gross margin percentage increased from approximately 29.2% in the year ended December 31, 2020 to approximately 31.2% in the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we fulfilled our OEM orders with normal gross margin because we are no longer required to absorb our fixed production costs after the closing of our factory in Nevada in May 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we had manufacturing overhead costs for our OEM and packaging sales including labor hours being allocated to such production, which we didn’t have during the majority of the year ended December 31, 2021. As a result, our OEM and packaging sales gross margin percentage increased by 2.0% during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
Selling expenses increased from approximately $48,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020 to approximately $83,000 in the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase of approximately $35,000, or 72.2%, was mainly due to the increase of approximately $10,000 of sales department salaries as we transferred our factory employees to be our sales representatives after closing our Nevada factory in May 2021, the increase of approximately $46,000 of shipping and packing expenses as we had more OEM orders that required packing and shipping services, offset by the decrease of approximately $21,000 of advertising and marketing expenses and other selling expenses.
General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses decreased by approximately $74,000 from approximately $1,345,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020 to approximately $1,272,000 in the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was mainly attributable to the decrease of approximately $29,000 of bad debt expense, a decrease of approximately $54,000 contractor expense and the decrease of approximately $21,000 salary and employee benefit expenses as we closed our Nevada factory in May 2021. The decrease was offset by the increase of approximately $29,000 in professional fees, such as attorney fees, auditor fees and consulting fees.
Stock compensation expenses decreased by approximately $241,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Approximately $180,000 and $296,000, related to the amortization of the value of 766,668 shares of restricted common stock issued to three employees for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which all had a vesting period of three years and were fully vested as of July 2021.
The loss on disposal of equipment increased by approximately $285,000 from a gain of $16,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020 to a loss of $268,800 in the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was mainly due to the Company disposing of its machinery in the Nevada factory for $7,700 which resulted $268,800 of loss on disposal of equipment in May 2021.
Other income (expense) increased by approximately $166,000 from an expense of approximately $(4,000) in the year ended December 31, 2020 to approximately $162,000 in the year ended December 31, 2021, mainly due to the decrease of interest expenses of approximately $143,000 incurred from a third party and related parties interest bearing loans that were transferred to DW Food California Food Distribution LLC, a related party, through a debt sale agreement in December 2020 and subsequently paid with shares of the Company’s common stock in December 2020. The increase of other income was also due to a $25,000 California Small Business COVID-19 Relief Grant that we received in May 2021.
Net loss decreased by approximately $622,000 from approximately $1.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 to approximately $1.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, mainly due to the reasons discussed above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had a cash balance of approximately $900, compared to a cash balance of approximately $10,000 at December 31, 2020.
In assessing our liquidity, we monitor and analyze our cash on-hand and our operating and capital expenditure commitments. Our liquidity needs are to meet our working capital requirements, operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations. Other than operating expenses and current liabilities of approximately $1.4 million, the Company does not have significant cash commitments. Cash requirements include cash needed for purchase of inventory, payroll, payroll taxes, rent, and other operating expenses. However, in response to the liquidity factors described above, the Company has continued to find ways to reduce its operating expenses. In addition, should our Company need funds, our principal shareholder and Chief Executive and Financial Officer Mr. Dinghua Wang may lend additional money to the Company from time to time to the extent he is in a position and willing to do so. No assurance can be provided that he will continue to lend funds to the Company in the future.
Management has concluded under U.S. GAAP that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of our lack of significant revenue and sufficient working capital. If we are unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing, we may be required to cease or limit our operations. Our financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, cash used in operating activities amounted to approximately $216,000 as compared to approximately $990,000 used in operating activities in the same period in 2020. Cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily the result of our approximately $1.2 million net loss, the non-cash adjustment of approximately $138,000 for the gain on forgiveness of loan payable, and the payment of lease liabilities of approximately $162,000. This amount was partially offset by the non-cash expense of approximately $180,000 in stock based compensation, approximately $38,000 of depreciation expenses, approximately $214,000 in amortization of operating leases right-of-use assets and approximately $269,000 of loss on disposal of equipment, the decrease of accounts receivable of approximately $50,000, the decrease of inventories of approximately $52,000, the decrease of prepaid expenses approximately $113,000 as we realized our prepaid inventory purchases to fulfill our OEM orders and the increase of accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately $111,000 and the increase of deferred revenue of approximately $246,000 as we still have some OEM backlog orders to be fulfilled.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, investing activities provided $7,700 in cash received from the sale of machinery in our Nevada factory.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, financing activities provided approximately $200,000 as compared to approximately $990,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020. Net cash received in the year ended December 31, 2021 includes approximately $138,000 from the second round of the SBA PPP loan that was forgiven in October 2021, and approximately $103,000 from a loan from our principal shareholder and Chief Executive and Financial Officer, Mr. Dinghua Wang partially offset by our repayment of approximately $24,000 to Mr. Dinghua Wang and approximately $17,000 of principal payments for long-term debt.
The material terms of the loans from Mr. Dinghua Wang, certain related parties and certain unaffiliated third parties are set forth in Note 6 and Note 7 of the accompanying notes to financial statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our stockholders.
