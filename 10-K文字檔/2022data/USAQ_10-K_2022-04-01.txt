Overview
We are a medical device technology and software as a service (SaaS) company focused on enabling primary care physicians (PCP’s) to increase their revenues by providing them with relevant, value-based tools to evaluate and treat chronic disease as well as provide preventive care through reimbursable procedures. In some cases, the products we provide our physician clients will enable them to diagnose and treat patients with chronic diseases which they historically have referred to specialists, allowing them to increase their practice revenue. As part of our mission, we are providing PCP’s with the software, training and devices necessary to allow them to treat their patients using value-based healthcare, informatics and algorithmic personalized medicine, including digital therapeutics. Our virtual and point of care solutions also support remote patient monitoring, to address chronic care and preventive medicine and are reimbursable to the medical practice.
In November 2020, we began shipping AllergiEnd® diagnostic related products and immunotherapy treatments to PCPs in response to their requests based upon courses of treatment recommended for their patients building on the capabilities of QHSLab, our primary SaaS tool. The Company’s revenue generated from sales of AllergiEnd® products was $329,989 in the fourth of quarter 2021 compared to $124,532 for the same period 2020 and $1,414,421 for the year ended 2021 compared to $124,532 for the year ended 2020. Our PCPs generated approximately $5,000,000 in revenues utilizing our products during 2021, of which $3.8 million was the result of providing allergy diagnostic tests to patients and approximately $1.2 million was the result of providing allergen immunotherapy treatments.
In June 2021, we announced that we had acquired the method patent, trademark and website associated with AllergiEnd®’s diagnostic and allergen immunotherapy product portfolio from MedScience Research Group, Inc. The acquisition of the AllergiEnd® assets provides us the opportunity to more fully integrate and leverage the product portfolio across our marketing platform, customer relationships and cost structure.
Based on the success of PCPs using our QHSLab allergy diagnostics combined with the products acquired from MedScience, we intend to increase our revenues by charging physicians a monthly subscription fee for the use of QHSLab and soliciting additional PCPs to increase their revenues by using our proven revenue generating QHSLab and AllergiEnd® line of products. We also plan to introduce additional point of care diagnostics and treatments, and digital medicine programs that PCPs can use and prescribe in their practices. In all cases, PCPs will be paid under existing government and private insurance programs, based upon analyses conducted utilizing QHSLab and treatments provided as a result of such analyses.
In addition to the direct sales and marketing efforts of our personnel, we have engaged with the University of Miami to launch and promote various continuing medical education activities to our target physician client audiences during 2021, and intend to replicate these programs during 2022. The Company has also engaged with Management Service Organizations (MSO), Independent Physician Associations (IPA’s) and Digital Marketing collaborations for joint marketing efforts and distribution. There are no assurances that these relationships will accelerate growth.
Recent Market Conditions
During March 2020, a global pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization related to the rapidly growing outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”). The pandemic has significantly impacted economic conditions in the United States and throughout the world. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and we do not yet know the full extent of potential impacts on our business, financing or global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material impact on our liquidity, capital resources and operations.
COVID-19 has accelerated both the healthcare provider and patient acceptance of virtual care and remote monitoring and therapeutic technologies supported by a physician’s direct involvement. Regulators and insurance companies are also recognizing what health care technologists have been saying for nearly 15 years, which is that most chronic conditions are better managed with more frequent and short patient encounters than infrequent visits to a medical professional. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and commercial health insurers are beginning to recognize that artificial intelligence enabled digital medicine technologies such as those provided through QHSLab can provide the necessary tools and support to foster patient treatment adherence in between visits to a physician.
Our ability to operate profitably is determined by our ability to generate revenues from the licensing of our QHSLab and the sale of diagnostic related products and treatment protocols and the provision of services through our QHSLab. Currently, we are generating revenues from the sale of AllergiEnd® diagnostic related products and immunotherapy treatments. Our ability to generate a profit from these sales is determined by our ability to increase the number of physicians using these products. We will continue to upgrade QHSLab’s offerings in an effort to increase the number of products sold based upon the services it can provide and for which we are able to charge a fee for its use.
Our revenues are largely determined by the volume of product delivered and the prices at which such products are sold. The principal factors determining our costs are the cost of improvements to QHSLab, the costs of products sold to PCPs, marketing expenses to recruit new PCPs and introduce new products and financing costs. As our business grows, these costs should be leveraged over a wider base of PCPs leading to a reduction in costs per sale and, helping to increase our gross margin.
Results of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020
Revenues
During the fourth quarter of 2020 we began to sell the AllergiEnd® Products, consisting of AllergiEnd® Allergy Diagnostics and Allergen Immunotherapy treatments, to physicians. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated revenues of $1,414,421 compared to $124,532 of revenues in 2020. The revenue increase for the year ended December 31, 2021, reflects the fact that sales of our AllergiEnd® Products commenced in the fourth quarter of 2020 and increased through 2021. Revenues in 2021 were primarily driven by sales of Allergy Diagnostic Kits of $854,930 and Immunotherapy Treatment services of $516,013 as we continued to expand the roll-out of our product lines and customer base.
Our revenues consisted of the following:
Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit
Cost of revenues consists of the cost of the AllergiEnd® test kit products and allergen immunotherapy pharmacy prepared treatment sets, shipping costs to our customers as well as labor expenses directly related to product sales.
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, cost of revenues was $743,673 and $74,439, respectively.
The Company generated a gross profit of $670,748, or a 47.4% gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $50,093, or 40.2% in 2020.
We are introducing new products at an early stage in our development cycle and the gross margins may vary significantly between periods, due, among other things, to differences among our customers and products sold, customer negotiating strengths, and product mix.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses (“R&D”) include expenses incurred in connection with the research and development of our QHSLab medical device technology solution. R&D costs are expensed as they are incurred.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, R&D expenses totaled $90,874 which is a decrease of $7,416, or 7.5%, compared to $98,290 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The decrease in R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2020, is primarily due to lower spending as we focused on selling AllergiEnd® Products and the acquisition of the AllergiEnd® assets during 2021. We expect that our R&D expenses will increase as we invest in and expand our operations and further develop new products and services as part of the Company’s growth strategy.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs associated with selling and marketing our products to PCP’s, principally ongoing sales efforts to recruit new PCP’s and maintain our relationships with PCP’s already using our software and products. Beginning in January 2021, these expenses included newly hired employees of the Company in addition to third-party consultants.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, sales and marketing expenses totaled $592,068 compared to $95,141 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase as we grow our customer base and launch additional products. However, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue may decrease if we are successful in onboarding a sufficient number of PCP’s and maintaining our relationships with these PCP’s once they begin to purchase our products.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs associated with operating a business including accounting, legal and management consulting fees.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, general and administrative expenses totaled $454,008, an increase of $322,241, compared to $131,767 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The increases in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2020, were primarily due to increased consulting fees for legal, investor relations and management services associated with the increase in our business activities. Additionally, we incurred expenses associated with processing payments on the sales generating revenue.
Other Expense
For the year ended December 31, 2021, interest expense increased by $215,506 to $246,490 from $30,984 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in interest expense was due to increases in the convertible note payable balances and newly incurred debt during 2021 and the amortization of the related discounts as compared to December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is a measure of a company’s ability to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. On December 31, 2021, we had current assets totaling $445,782, including $286,855 of cash, $70,474 of accounts receivable, $65,740 of inventory, and $22,713 related to prepaid expenses and other current assets. At such date we had total current liabilities of $874,954 consisting of $20,370 in accounts payable, $253,865 relating to the current portions of loan balances, $542,104 relating to current portions of convertible notes payable and $58,615 in current liabilities. Our long-term liabilities balance of $509,477 consisted of convertible notes totaling $100,000 and $402,956 associated with the long-term portion of loans payable, and accrued interest expenses of $6,521.
On December 31, 2020, we had $266,163 of current assets including $94,342 of cash, $60,522 of accounts receivable, $99,701 of inventory, $11,598 related to the prepayment of service contracts. We had total current liabilities of $214,620 consisting of $159,620 in accounts payable and other current liabilities and $55,000 in a convertible note payable. Our long-term liabilities at such date of $691,569 consisted of seven convertible notes in the aggregate principal and premium amount of $576,003 along with accrued interest expenses of $115,566.
The increase in our assets and liabilities from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021, relates primarily to the promissory note of $750,000 issued in connection with our acquisition of certain assets related to our AllergiEnd® products and the Original Issue Discount Secured Convertible Promissory Note in the principal amount of $806,000 (the “OID Note”) issued along with warrants to purchase 930,000 shares of our common stock for aggregate consideration of $750,000. The acquisition of the assets related to our AllergiEnd® products should enable us to increase our margins on the sale of these products enabling us to satisfy the $750,000 Note. The net proceeds of the OID Note primarily will be used to increase our sales and marketing efforts.
The changes in accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable primarily relate to sales of AllergiEnd® Products.
We used cash of $354,738 and $165,564 in operations during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We began to generate revenues in the fourth quarter of 2020. Nevertheless, we continued to generate negative cash flows which were financed primarily through our entry into a factoring agreement for our receivables, a loan from our credit card processor and other borrowings as we had done previously. As a result, we owed increased amounts to third parties discussed below. In addition, to preserve our cash, we paid our obligations to certain of our vendors by issuances of an aggregate of 120,000 shares of our common stock during the year ended 2021, net of cancelled shares.
Our convertible notes payable were reduced during the year ended 2021 as four notes totaling $802,367, inclusive of accrued interest, were converted into 837,213 shares of our common stock, 2,644,424 shares of our Series A-2 preferred shares and 81,793 warrants. In addition, in the second quarter of 2021 we sold 50,000 shares of our common stock to one individual for $30,000.
Although we are now generating revenues from the sale of our AllergiEnd® products we are likely to continue to require funds to support our operations for the immediate future. If our business continues to grow, we will seek to satisfy our cash needs by issuances of our equity securities or debt. In the past, we have had to rely on our principal shareholder to support our operations. More recently, we have borrowed money from third parties. If we are unable to obtain the funds we need from third parties, there is no assurance that any of our related parties will continue to provide such capital as may be necessary to continue our business or, if such funds are provided, that the agreed upon terms of any advance will be favorable to us.
To facilitate the expansion of our operations, on August 10, 2021, we issued an Original Issue Discount Secured Convertible Promissory Note (the “Note”) in the principal amount of $806,000 and warrants to purchase 930,000 shares of our common stock (the “Warrants”) for $750,000 and from which, after payment of brokerage commissions and other expenses, we derived net proceeds of approximately $665,000.
The principal amount of the Note and all interest accrued thereon is payable on August 10, 2022, and is secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets. The Note provides for interest at the rate of 5% per annum, payable at maturity, and is convertible into shares of our common stock at a price of $0.65 per share. In addition to customary anti-dilution adjustments the Note provides, subject to certain limited exceptions, that if we issue common stock or common stock equivalents at a per share price lower than the conversion price then in effect, the conversion price will be reduced to the per share price at which such shares or common share equivalents are sold. The holder converted $50,000 of the principal amount into 76,923 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.65 per share.
The Warrants are excisable for a period of three years at a price of $1.25 per share, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The shares issuable upon conversion of the Note and exercise of the Warrants have been registered under the Securities Act for resale by the Buyer. If at any time after February 10, 2022, there is no effective registration statement covering the resale of the shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, then the Warrant may be exercised by means of a “cashless exercise.”
Plan of Operation and Funding
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We had an accumulated deficit of $2,518,895 at December 31, 2021, generated net losses of $770,176 and $327,388 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and used cash of $354,738 and $165,564 in operations in these periods. Although we began to generate revenue during the fourth quarter of 2020, we anticipate that we will continue to generate negative cash flow for the immediate future. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain necessary equity or debt financing and ultimately from generating revenues and positive cash flow to continue operations. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds, further issuances of securities and borrowings, and that we will remain highly leveraged as we seek to expand our business. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business, as we incur marketing expenses and the cost of building an inventory. Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next twelve months. We have entered into a Receivables Purchase and Security Agreement providing us with up to $150,000 against certain accounts receivable and received a short-term loan from a merchant bank with repayments tied to future credit card payment transactions. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments and advances from our principal shareholder. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business and (ii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses by raising additional capital or, when available, borrowing additional funds. In addition to meeting our working capital requirements to expand our business, as our outstanding notes become due, we will need to arrange for financing to satisfy the notes or enter into refinancing agreements with the holders of our notes. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.
