Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of CinCor Pharma, Inc., or Cincor or the the Company, should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. This discussion and analysis reflects our historical results of operations and financial position. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risk, uncertainties and assumptions. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Please also refer to the section under the heading “Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing our lead clinical candidate, CIN-107, for the treatment of hypertension and other cardio-renal diseases. CIN-107 is a highly selective, oral small molecule inhibitor of aldosterone synthase, the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of aldosterone in the adrenal gland. CIN-107 has been designed to use differentiated mechanism of action, direct inhibition of aldosterone synthase production, with the goal of providing an improved treatment for patients suffering from hypertension, or high blood pressure. We are conducting multiple Phase 2 clinical trials using CIN-107 in differing populations of patients, all of whom are hypertensive. The most advanced of our trials, called BrigHtn, is being conducted in patients whose blood pressure is not controlled despite treatment with three or more antihypertensive agents, one of which must be a diuretic; these patients are designated as having treatment resistant hypertension, or rHTN. In March 2022 we completed enrollment in the BrigHtn trial with 275 patients randomized. A separate Phase 2 clinical trial, referred to as HALO, is evaluating CIN-107’s effects on patients whose blood pressure is not controlled despite treatment with up to two antihypertensive agents, referred to as uncontrolled hypertension, or uHTN. HALO was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2021. A third patient population being investigated has a condition called primary aldosteronism, or PA, where overproduction of aldosterone by non-malignant tumors or abnormal collections of aldosterone-producing cells in the adrenal glands leads to an aggressive form of hypertension. The trial in the PA patients, referred to as spark-PA, was also initiated in 2021 and is currently undergoing a protocol revision designed to accelerate recruitment in this less commonly diagnosed form of hypertension. Lastly, we are evaluating the utility of CIN-107 in lowering the blood pressure of patients with chronic kidney disease, or CKD, as well as exploring the potential impact of the drug on slowing the progression of renal disease using biomarkers of that progression. The CKD trial is expected to commence in the first half of 2022.
Since our inception in 2018, we have focused primarily on raising capital, organizing and staffing our company, business planning, and acquiring and progressing our lead product candidate, CIN-107, through clinical development after in-licensing the compound from F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann La-Roche Inc., whom we collectively refer to as Roche, in May 2019. We were initially founded as a subsidiary of CinRx Pharma, LLC, or CinRx, and spun out as an independent company in 2019 after the closing of our Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock financing and the execution of our in-licensing transaction with Roche. We completed our Series B preferred stock financing in October 2021.
On January 11, 2022, we completed an initial public offering, the "IPO," of our common stock pursuant to which we issued and sold 13,290,813 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $16.00 per share. This included the exercise of 1,190,813 shares, representing a portion of the underwriters' over-allotment option to purchase an additional 1,815,000 shares. The aggregate net proceeds from the IPO, inclusive of proceeds from the over-allotment exercise, were approximately $193.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $14.9 million and offering expenses of approximately $4.5 million. Upon completion of the IPO, all outstanding shares of Series A and Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock converted to common stock at a ratio of 3.4:1. In addition, the IPO also resulted in the automatic net exercise of the three outstanding Roche Warrants for an aggregate of 852,788 shares of common stock.
We do not have any product candidates approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. From inception through December 31, 2021, we have funded our operations primarily through equity financings, and have raised an aggregate of approximately $192.9 million of gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our preferred stock. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents on hand of $136.6 million.
We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for CIN-107 or any future product candidates, if ever. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for CIN-107 or any future product candidates and do not enter into a third-party commercialization partnership, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution activities. As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public or private equity offerings and debt financings or other sources, such as potential collaboration agreements, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to obtain funding, we will be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect our business prospects, or we may be unable to continue operations. Although we continue to pursue these plans, there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to us to fund continuing operations, if at all.
Roche License Agreement
In May 2019, following the closing of the initial tranche of our Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock financing, we entered into a license agreement, or the Roche Agreement, with Roche, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license under certain patents and specified know-how owned or controlled by Roche and Roche’s interest in joint patents and covering certain specified small molecule aldosterone synthase inhibitors, or the Roche Technology, to research, develop, register, use, make, import, export, market, distribute, sell (as well as the right to have each of the foregoing done) and otherwise exploit products containing such aldosterone synthase inhibitors, or the Licensed Products, for any and all uses, including the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of any and all diseases and medical conditions in humans and animals.
Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
To date, we have not recognized any revenue from any sources, including from product sales, and we do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future. If our development efforts for CIN-107 or any future product candidate is successful and results in regulatory approval, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales. However, there can be no assurance as to when we will generate such revenue, if at all.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our research and discovery efforts and the development of CIN-107 or any future product candidates. We expense research and development costs as incurred, which include:
•external research and development expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as CROs, as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials, preclinical studies and other scientific development services;
•costs related to acquiring, developing, and manufacturing clinical study material for our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including fees paid to contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs;
•laboratory supplies and research materials;
•upfront, milestone and maintenance fees incurred under license, acquisition and other third-party agreements; and
•costs related to compliance with clinical regulatory requirements.
Costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as information provided to us by our vendors and clinical sites and analyzing the progress
of clinical trials or other services performed. Significant judgment and estimates are made in determining the accrued expense balances at the end of any reporting period.
We track external research and development costs on a program-by-program basis. External costs include fees paid to consultants, contractors and vendors, including CMOs and CROs, in connection with our clinical activities. We currently only have one product development program, CIN-107.
Research and development activities will continue to be central to our business model. We anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase for the foreseeable future as we advance our product candidates through clinical trials, as well as acquire new product candidates. We also expect higher employee- related expenses, including higher stock-based compensation expenses, as well as higher consulting costs as we hire additional resources to support increasing development activity.
The successful development of CIN-107 or any future product candidate is highly uncertain. We cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing, and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete development of CIN-107 or any future product candidate due to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development. Clinical and preclinical development timelines, the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from the sale of CIN-107 or any future product candidate, if they are approved.
The duration, costs and timing of the clinical development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to, the following:
•the scope, rate of progress, and expenses of our ongoing research activities as well as any preclinical studies and clinical trials and other research and development activities;
•the number and scope of clinical programs we decide to pursue;
•the uncertainties in clinical trial design and patient enrollment rates;
•establishing an appropriate safety and efficacy profile;
•successful enrollment in and completion of clinical trials;
•whether CIN-107 shows safety and efficacy in our clinical trials;
•the timing, receipt and terms of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•making arrangements with third-party CMOs for manufacturing;
•obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for CIN-107 and any future product candidate;
•commercializing product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and
•continued acceptable safety profile of the products following any regulatory approval.
A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of CIN-107 or any future product candidate would significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of those product candidates. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any product candidate. We may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials. We may elect to discontinue, delay or modify clinical trials of some product candidates or focus on other product candidates. For example, if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, or another regulatory authority were to delay our planned start of clinical trials or require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we currently expect or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our planned clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development of that product candidate.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and employee-related costs for our finance, human resources and other administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits and other related costs, as well as expenses for outside professional services, including legal, accounting and audit services and other consulting fees, rent expense, other general administrative expenses, and stock-based compensation.
We expect our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research activities and development of our product candidates, potential commercialization efforts, and increased costs associated with being a public company. These increases will likely include additional costs related to the
hiring of new personnel, including higher stock-based compensation expenses, and fees to outside consultants, as well as other related expenses. We also anticipate that we will incur significantly increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance and director and officer insurance costs as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with operating as a public company.
Amended and Restated Management Services Agreement with CinRx Pharma
In April 2020, we entered into the Management Services Agreement, with CinRx pursuant to which CinRx provided us with certain professional services. The Management Services Agreement had a term of two years, and was automatically renewable for successive one-year periods unless terminated. In exchange for services provided to us under the Management Services Agreement, we paid CinRx monthly fees for management services calculated based on costs incurred by CinRx in the provision of services to us, plus a reasonable mark-up. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we paid CinRx $1.3 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Of these fees $0.9 million and $1.2 million are included in research and development expenses while $0.4 million and $0.4 million are in general and administrative expenses on our statements of operations and comprehensive loss as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We terminated the Management Services Agreement pursuant to its terms on February 2, 2022.
Interest Income
Interest income consists primarily of interest income received on our cash and cash equivalents.
Change in Fair Value of Warrant Derivative Liabilities
The change in fair value of warrant derivative liabilities consists of the change in fair value related to the three freestanding detachable stock purchase warrants issued to Roche in connection with the Roche Agreement, which we collectively refer to as the Roche Warrants. The first Roche Warrant, which was issued in connection with our Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock financing, was exercisable for 411,765 shares of our common stock. The second Roche Warrant, issued in connection with our Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock financing, was exercisable for 329,552 shares of our common stock. The third Roche Warrant, issued in connection with our Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock financing, was exercisable for 113,610 shares of our common stock. The Roche Warrants are collectively exercisable for 854,927 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.04 per share. The Roche Warrants automatically net exercised in whole immediately prior to the effectiveness of the IPO, which resulted in the issuance of 852,788 of common shares.
The grant date fair value of the Roche Warrants are calculated using the Black Scholes valuation model. The valuation models used require the input of subjective assumptions, including assumptions about the expected life of the Roche Warrant, share price volatility and as a privately held company, the estimated fair value of our common stock. These assumptions used represent our best estimates at the time of issuance and in subsequent reporting periods, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment.
Results of Operations
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations for each of the years presented:
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $21.5 million, compared to $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $2.3 million, or 12.3%, was primarily due to the
progression of several Phase 2 clinical trials, increased chemistry, manufacturing and controls spending and the addition of several important R&D full-time resources, partially offset by the completion of several Phase 1 and clinical pharmacology studies in 2020.
We expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing our product candidates, including investments in manufacturing, as our programs advance into later stages of development and we continue to conduct clinical trials. The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming, and the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. We will also incur increased expenses related to headcount to support our continued research activities and development of our product candidates.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $19.0 million, or 969.4%, is primarily related to $10.0 million incurred in connection with our legal settlement with CinRx. See Footnote 10 " Commitment and Contingencies" for more information. Additional drivers of the increased G&A expenses year over year included legal costs and hiring of key leadership and other critical management roles, particularly in preparation to operate as a stand-alone public company.
We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to build our infrastructure to operate as a stand-alone public company.
Interest Income
Interest income was $21.6 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $36.7 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting interest earned on cash equivalents. The difference was attributed primarily to our increased cash equivalents during the year, resulting from our Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock proceeds.
Change in Fair Value of Warrant Derivative Liabilities
The change in the fair value of the warrant derivative liabilities was $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the increase in the underlying common stock price. The Roche Warrants were issued in connection with the Roche Agreement and in connection with our Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock financing in 2019, with an additional warrant issued in connection with our Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock financing. We classify these warrants as a liability on our balance sheets which we remeasure to fair value at each reporting date. We recognize changes in the fair value of the warrant derivative liabilities as a component of other (income) expense in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss. These Roche Warrants were automatically net exercised for an aggregate of 852,788 shares of common stock upon the completion of our IPO in January 2022.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
Since our inception, we have not recognized any revenue and have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We have not yet commercialized any product and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any products for several years, if at all. From inception through December 31, 2021, we have funded our operations primarily through private equity financings, and have raised an aggregate of approximately $192.9 million of gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our preferred stock. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents on hand of $136.6 million. Subsequent to the year-end, CinCor completed an IPO, raising net proceeds of $193.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering expenses. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings and debt financings or other sources, such as potential collaboration agreements, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements.
Cash Flows
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes our cash flows for each of the years presented:
Operating Activities
We have historically experienced negative operating cash outflows as we continue clinical development of CIN-107. Our net cash used in operating activities primarily results from our net and comprehensive loss adjusted for non-cash expenses and changes in working capital components. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are amounts due to CROs for the conduct of our clinical programs and employee-related expenditures for research and development, and general and administrative activities. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected by spending to advance and support our clinical development and other operating and general administrative activities.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities was $30.8 million and was primarily related to cash payments for clinical development activities, increased personnel costs and certain professional fees and other costs associated with operating activities.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities was $17.4 million and was primarily related to cash payments for clinical development activities and personnel-related costs under our Management Services Agreement with CinRx, legal and professional fees and other costs associated with operating activities.
Investing Activities
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no cash flows from investing activities.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $141.4 million , consisting primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $32.0 million, consisting primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock in August 2020.
Funding Requirements
As of December 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents on hand were $136.6 million. Based on our current plans, we believe that our existing cash on hand, including the net proceeds from the IPO of $193.2 million, are estimated to support the our operating expenses and capital requirements through 2024, including our ongoing and currently planned Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical programs. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could expend our capital resources sooner than we expect. This estimate is based on our current business plan and does not include any additional expenditures related to potential future development of additional product candidates or indications or resulting from the potential in-licensing or acquisition of additional product candidates or technologies, or any associated development we may pursue. This period could be shortened if there are any significant increases beyond our expectations in spending on development programs or more rapid progress of development programs than anticipated.
We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our product candidates through preclinical and clinical development, seek regulatory approval and pursue commercialization of any approved product candidates. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative costs will increase in connection with our planned clinical development activities. In addition, we expect to incur increased costs associated with operating as a public company.
If we receive regulatory approval for CIN-107, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution, depending on where we choose to commercialize. We may also require additional capital to pursue in-licenses or acquisitions of other product candidates.
Our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including:
•the costs of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials;
•the scope, progress, results and costs of discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing, and clinical trials for product candidates we may develop, if any;
•the costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;
•our ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;
•the achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under any license or collaboration agreements we might have at such time;
•the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
•the amount of revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval;
•the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights, and defending intellectual property-related claims;
•our headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our business operations and research and development activities;
•the costs of building out internal accounting, legal, compliance and other operational and administrative functions;
•the timing and size of any milestone payments required under our existing or future arrangements, including the Roche Agreement; and
•the costs of operating as a public company.
The net proceeds from our recent IPO, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, may not be sufficient to commercialize CIN-107 or any other product candidate. Accordingly, we may be required to obtain further funding to achieve our business objectives.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings and debt financings or other sources, such as potential collaboration agreements, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interests may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that could adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.
If we raise funds through potential collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
License Agreement Obligations
License agreement obligations relate to the Roche Agreement that we entered into with Roche in May 2019. Under the terms of the Roche Agreement, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to the Roche Technology to research, develop, register, use, make, import, export, market, distribute, sell (as well as the right to have each of the foregoing done) and otherwise exploit to a novel aldosterone synthase inhibitor compound, CIN-107. Pursuant to the Roche Agreement, we paid Roche a one-time, upfront non-refundable license fee of $2.0 million and one $1.0 million milestone payment in connection with the completion of the multiple ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial of CIN-107. We are required to pay Roche certain tiered development event-based milestone payments, certain sales-based milestone payments, as well as a royalty from the future sales of Licensed Products. The royalty is tiered based on the combined net sales of each Licensed Product.
We are currently unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving these clinical and commercial milestones or generating future product sales. See the section titled “Item 1.Business-License Agreement with Roche” elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as Note 4 to our audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of our license agreement with Roche.
Purchase and Other Obligations
In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts with CROs and other third parties for conducting research and development activities, preclinical studies and clinical trials, research and development supplies and other testing and manufacturing services. The scope of the services under these contracts can be modified and provide for termination on notice, and therefore are cancellable contracts.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
This management’s discussion and analysis is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our estimates are based on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts, and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates.
While our accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates. See Note 2 to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of our other significant accounting policies.
Prepaid and Accrued Research and Development Expenses
As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our prepaid and accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed. We make estimates of our prepaid and accrued research and development expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at the time. We confirm the accuracy of estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated prepaid and accrued research and development expenses include expenses for:
•CROs in connection with clinical studies;
•investigative sites in connection with clinical studies;
•vendors in connection with preclinical development activities; and
•vendors related to product manufacturing, development and distribution of clinical materials.
We base our expenses related to clinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. The scope of services under these contracts can be modified and some of the agreements may be cancelled by either party upon written notice. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of subjects and the completion of clinical study milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly.
Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, we may
report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates and amounts actually incurred.
Warrant Derivative Instruments including Determination of the Fair Value of Underlying Common Stock
We account for derivatives, specifically freestanding detachable stock purchase warrants, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. This guidance establishes accounting and reporting principles for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts. The Roche Warrants which are discussed previously are valued using the Black Scholes valuation model. The Black Scholes valuation was determined using assumptions that are subjective and require significant judgement and estimation by management, including the fair value of our common stock, as discussed below. Other assumptions include the risk-free rate, expected volatility, term and dividend yield, if applicable. The risk-free rate assumption was based on observed yields from governmental zero-coupon bonds. The expected volatility assumption was based on historical volatilities of a group of comparable industry companies whose stock prices are publicly available. The peer group was developed based on companies in the therapeutics and pharmaceutical industries.
Determination of the Fair Value of Common Stock
As there was no public market for our common stock through December 31, 2021, the estimated fair value of our common stock has been determined by management as of each reporting date, with input from third-party valuations of our common stock as well as our management's assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent third-party valuation to each reporting date. These third-party valuations of our common stock were determined in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, or AICPA Practice Aid. The assumptions used in the valuation model were based on future expectations combined with management judgment.
In addition to considering the results of these third-party valuations, our board of directors considered various objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock as of each reporting date, which may be a date later than the most recent third-party valuation date, including:
•the prices at which we sold preferred stock and the superior rights and preferences of the preferred stock relative to our common stock at the time of each reporting date;
•the progress of our research and development programs, including the status of ongoing and planned clinical trials;
•our stage of development and our business strategy;
•external market conditions affecting the biotechnology industry, and trends within the biotechnology industry;
•our financial position, including cash on hand, and our historical and forecasted performance and operating results;
•the lack of an active public market for our common stock and our preferred stock;
•the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event or a sale of our company in light of prevailing market conditions; and
•the analysis of IPOs and the market performance of similar companies in the biopharmaceutical industry.
The assumptions underlying these valuations represent management’s best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our analysis and related statement of operations and comprehensive loss impact could be materially different.
Following the closing of the IPO on January 11, 2022, the fair value of our common stock will be determined based on the quoted market price of our common stock.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (ASC 718). ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the condensed statements of operations and comprehensive loss based on their fair values. The Company’s stock-based awards are subject only to service-based vesting conditions. The Company estimates the fair value of its stock-based awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input
of assumptions, including (a) the expected stock price volatility, (b) the calculation of expected term of the award, (c) the risk-free interest rate, and (d) expected dividends.
Due to the lack of a public market for the trading of the Company’s common stock as of December 31, 2021 and a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, the Company has based its estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded. The Company believes that the companies in the group have characteristics similar to its own characteristics, including stage of product development and a focus on the life sciences industry. The Company believes the group selected has sufficient similar economic and industry characteristics and includes companies that are most representative of the Company.
The Company uses the simplified method, as prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term, as it does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term for options granted and utilizes the contractual term for options granted. The risk-free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options.
Compensation expense related to awards is calculated on a straight-line basis by recognizing the grant date fair value over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term.
Emerging Growth Company Status and Smaller Reporting Company Status
We are an “emerging growth company,” or EGC, under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an EGC can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an EGC can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of the delayed adoption of new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same requirements to adopt new or revised accounting standards as private entities.
As an EGC, we may also take advantage of certain exemptions and reduced reporting requirements under the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions, as an EGC:
•we are presenting only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K;
•we will avail ourselves of the exemption from providing an auditor’s attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
•we will avail ourselves of the exemption from complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis;
•we are providing reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; and
•we will not require nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments.
We will remain an EGC until the earliest of (i) December 31, 2027, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more, (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the previous rolling three-year period, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.
We are also a “smaller reporting company,” meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates plus the proposed aggregate amount of gross proceeds to us as a result of our IPO is less than $700 million and our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) our annual revenue is less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million.
If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an EGC, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to EGCs, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.
Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Other than as disclosed in Note 2 to our audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not expect that any recently issued accounting standards will have a material impact on our financial statements or will otherwise apply to our operations.
