Results of Operations
General
The inclusion of supplementary analytical and related information herein may require us to make estimates and assumptions to enable us to fairly present, in all material respects, our analysis of trends and expectations with respect to our results of operations and financial position taken as a whole. Actual results may vary from the estimates and assumptions we make.
Results of Operation
Revenues. Due to the exploration rather than the production nature of our business, we did not have any revenue associated with our business activities; furthermore, we do not expect to have significant operating revenue in the foreseeable future.
Operating expenses. Our operating expenses include exploration expenses, general and administrative expenses, professional fees and transfer agent and filing fees. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our operating expenses increased by $77,143 or 154%, to $127,133 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $49,990 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
This change was mainly associated with expenditures on general and administrative fees, which increased by $49,103 to $60,582 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $11,479 we incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020, of which $20,700 we paid for redesigning our website and corporate presentation materials, the expense we did not have during the year ended December 31, 2020, and $33,774 we paid for consulting fees. Our professional fees increased by $19,320, to $40,220 as comparted to $20,900 we incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020; our exploration expenses increased by $8,133 to $15,482 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $7,349 we incurred in mineral exploration expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020; this increase was associated with acquisition of additional mineral projects during the current year, and finalizing the transfer of the Loman Claims into our name. Our transfer agent and filing fees were $10,849, and remained comparable to $10,262 we incurred in filing fees for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Other items. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized $474,287 loss on fair value of equity investments (2020 - $135,849 gain). The loss resulted from revaluation of WRR Shares and WRR warrants and was caused mainly by decreased market price of WRR’s shares from CAD$0.10 per share at December 31, 2020, to CAD$0.04 per share at December 31, 2021, and to a smaller degree from fluctuation of exchange rates between the US and Canadian dollars. We earned $755 in interest revenue (2020 - $2,881). Since the funds generated from the sale of equity investments are held in Canadian dollars, we incurred $7,119 gain associated with foreign exchange fluctuation rates (2020 - $30,552). During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded $315 (2020 - $168,866) gain on equity investments which was associated with the sale of 21,000 WRR Shares for net proceeds of $2,152. During the comparative period ended December 31, 2020, we sold a total of 5,640,000 WRR Shares for net proceeds of $540,579. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2021,we recorded $94,404 in accretion expenses associated with the beneficial conversion discount we recognized on our convertible notes payable we issued in September and October of 2021, and recorded $4,936 on accrued interest expense associated with conversion of the previously non-interest-bearing advance for a total of $15,064 we owed to a third-party into a convertible promissory note for a total of $20,000.
Net income/(loss). At December 31, 2021, our net loss was $692,571, as compared to net income of $288,158 we incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020. This change mainly resulted from $474,287 loss on revaluation of our equity investments in WRR Shares, as opposed to $135,849 gain we recognized in the comparative period. In addition, during the comparative year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $168,866 gain on equity investments which was associated with the sale of 5,640,000 WRR Shares for net proceeds of $540,579, as compared to $315 gain we recognized for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we also recorded $94,404 in accretion expenses associated with the beneficial conversion discount we recognized on our convertible notes payable which is issued in September and October 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had a cash balance of $1,420,864 and a working capital deficit of $348,869 with cash flows used in operations totalling $222,230 for the year then ended. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our operations were funded with $2,152 cash we generated from the sales of our equity investments and $980,000 we raised through convertible notes payable.
We did not generate sufficient cash flows from our operating activities to satisfy our cash requirements for the year ended December 31, 2021. There is no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash from our operations to repay the amounts owing under these notes and advances payable, or to service our other debt obligations.
To provide us with the necessary capital to accomplish our plan of operation we intend to seek additional financing in the form of equity or debt. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to raise additional capital. If we are unable to secure additional capital through equity or debt financing, we may choose to sell all or part of our investment in WRR.
Cash Flow
Net cash used in operating activities
Our net cash used in operating activities increased by $177,721, or 399%, to $222,230 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with $44,509 for the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we used $126,378 to cover our cash operating costs, $98,000 to repay founder advances which were payable on demand, and $20,523 to prepay some of our future operating costs; these uses of cash were offset by increase in our accounts payable of $22,671.
Our net cash used in operating activities decreased by $51,297, or 54%, to $44,509 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with $95,806 for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we used $47,109 to cover our cash operating costs; this use of cash was offset by increase in our accounts payable of $2,600.
Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash used by operating activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized $474,287 gain on revaluation of fair value of equity investments associated with WRR Shares and WRR Warrants which resulted from the fluctuation in share prices and foreign exchange rates, we also recorded $315 gain on sale of our equity investments. Since our equity investments are held in CAD$, we recorded $7,119 gain resulting from the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates during the year. In addition, we recorded $94,404 accretion expense associated with the discount on the convertible notes payable we issued in September and October 2021, and recorded $4,936 accrued interest expense associated with conversion of the previously non-interest-bearing advance for a total of $15,064 we owed to a third-party into a convertible promissory note for a total of $20,000.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $135,849 gain on revaluation of fair value of equity investments associated with WRR Shares and WRR Warrants which resulted from the fluctuation in share prices and foreign exchange rates, we also recorded $168,866 gain on sale of our equity investments. Since our equity investments are held in CAD$, we recorded $30,552 gain resulting from the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates during the year.
Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated $2,152 on the sale of 21,000 WRR Shares. During the same period, we used $240,000 to acquire our mineral property interests.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated $540,579 on the sale of 5,640,000 WRR Shares.
Net cash provided by financing activities
During the year ended December 31, we received $980,000 on issuance of convertible notes payable due 12 months from the issuance date (the “Notes”). The Notes accrue interest at a rate of 15% per annum and are unsecured. At the option of the Note Holder, the Company may either (i) pay the interest quarterly in arrears, or (ii) allow the interest to accrue until the Maturity Date. In addition, at the Company’s sole discretion, the Company may either (i) repay the principal amount of the Notes on the Maturity Date, or (ii) commencing one month from the issue date repay 1/12 of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes in any given month until the Maturity Date. At the option of the Note Holder the Notes can be converted into the Shares of the Company at a conversion price equal to the lesser of (i) $0.375 per Share, or (ii) a 25% discount to the price per Share in a qualified public offering that occurs subsequent to the sale of the Notes and results in gross offering proceeds to the Company of at least $5,000,000.
We did not engage in any financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Going Concern
At December 31, 2021, we had a working capital deficit of $348,869 and cash on hand of $1,420,864, which is not sufficient to carry out our current plan of operation. Our capital assets include equity investment in WRR shares and warrants, which we can use as a source of additional cash inflow, should we decide to sell all or part of our investment. In addition, we are actively pursuing other means of financing our operations through additional equity and/or debt financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to procure funds sufficient to support our day-to-day operations and exploration programs. If operating difficulties or other factors (many of which are beyond our control) delay our realization of revenues or cash flows from operations, we may be limited in our ability to pursue our business plan. Moreover, if our resources from obtaining additional capital or cash flows from operations, once we commence them, do not satisfy our operational needs or if unexpected expenses arise due to unanticipated pressures or if we decide to expand our business plan beyond its currently anticipated level or otherwise, we will require additional financing to fund our operations, in addition to anticipated cash generated from our operations. Additional financing might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds were not available or were not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance our business or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited. In a worst-case scenario, we might not be able to fund our operations or to remain in business, which could result in a total loss of our stockholders’ investment. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be reduced, and these newly issued securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders.
Impact of Inflation
We believe that inflation has had a negligible effect on operations over the past fiscal year.
Capital Expenditures
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we used $20,000 to make and initial cash payment to acquire Agai-Pah Property, $20,000 to make and initial cash payment to acquire Belshazzar Property, and made a $200,000 initial cash option payment to acquire an Olinghouse Purchase Option.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we did not have any transactions resulting in capital expenditures.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
None.
Pronouncements
We have implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect, and that may impact our financial statements and do not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
