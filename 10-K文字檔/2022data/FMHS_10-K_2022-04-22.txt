ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is designed to provide a reader of the financial statements with a narrative report on
our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. We use United States GAAP financial measures in the MD&A, unless otherwise noted. All the GAAP financial measures used by us in this report relate to the inclusion of financial information. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the audited Financial Statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 included under Item 8 in this Report. The MD&A contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. See the cautionary language at the beginning of this Report regarding forward-looking statements.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Until such time we can raise additional capital or generate positive cash flow from operations, we will continue to be funded through short-term advances from the Company officers, borrowings under promissory notes and sales of restricted common stock under various offerings. We estimate we will need $2,500,000 in capital, after satisfying our debt obligations, to cover our ongoing expenses and to successfully market and expand our product offerings. This is only an estimate and may change as we receive feedback from customers and have a better feel of the demand and revenues from our new products. Both of these factors may change and we may not be able to raise the necessary capital and if we are able to, that it may not be at favorable rates. We intend to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares.
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we generated revenues of $12,243 and $16,691, respectively, and we reported net losses of $975,579 and $1,045,479, respectively. We had negative cash flow from operating activities of $210,232 and $101,554, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $5,301,917 and total shareholders’ deficit of $1,571,243.
Our auditors have raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of our historical recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations as well as our dependence on private equity and financings. We anticipate that we will continue to report losses and negative cash flow. To date, we have financed our activities principally from the sale of common stock and loans from Company officers. We intend on financing our future working capital needs from these sources until such time that funds provided by our operations are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements. We believe that the current cash on hand, loans from Company officers and funds raised from the sale of our common stock allows us sufficient capital for operations and to continue as a going concern.
In April 2021, we authorized an offering of up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.51 per share, providing proceeds of up to $510,000, to be offered and sold only to investors that qualify as “accredited investors” as that term is defined in Regulation D. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold 246,236 shares of common stock under this offering for proceeds of $127,500. This offering was terminated on August 31, 2021.
Subsequent to December 31, 2021, we authorized an offering of up to 294,118 shares of common stock at $0.85 per share, providing proceeds of up to $250,000, to be offered and sold only to investors that qualify as “accredited investors” as that term is defined in Regulation D. Through April 22, 2022, the date of this report, we sold 69,900 shares of common stock under this offering for proceeds of $59,415. This offering terminates on May 1, 2022 and may be extended for 90 days until August 1, 2022 by the board of directors.
Related party matters
The terms of any transaction determined to be with related parties are presented to the board of directors (other than any interested director) for approval and documented in the corporate minutes. Cash advances are commonly provided by our officers for operating expenses and direct payment of Company expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Company officers made cash advances of $24,620 and were repaid $14,857. We also paid our officers accrued interest of $1,937 during the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Company officers made cash advances of $64,652 and were repaid $26,006. The cash advances are non-interest bearing and are unsecured. Company officers own approximately 44.7% of our Common Stock as of December 31, 2021. We have agreed to indemnify Company officers for certain events or occurrences arising as a result of the officer or director serving in such capacity. Other than the foregoing, none of the directors or executive officers of the Company, nor any person who owned of record or was known to own beneficially more than 5% of our outstanding shares of common stock has any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction that has occurred during the past fiscal year.
Litigation developments
In July 2021, we successfully enforced our subsidiary’s, DTLA, contract rights in a multi-licensed cannabis retail dispensary, grow, manufacturer and distributor called Los Angeles Farmers, Inc. (“LAFI”). After four years of litigation, a Final Judgment was filed into the record in the Superior Court of California in the County of Los Angeles for case number BC681251 (the “DLTA Judgment”). The DTLA Judgment awarded 49% of LAFI to DTLA. In addition to equity ownership, the DTLA Judgment awarded DTLA a share of any profits of this dispensary from November 2017 to the present and going forward along with accrued interest on those profits and the costs of bringing litigation. The DLTA Judgment also appointed a Monitor, to be supervised by the Arbitrator, to determine how much in past profits and interest DTLA is entitled to be awarded and that DTLA is treated fairly by LAFI on a going forward basis.
Between July and December 2021, the Monitor undertook a detailed process to determine the value of the 49% of profits and proceeds from 2017 to the present that DTLA is entitled to, in addition to the 10% prejudgment interest. The Monitor’s report was completed in January 2022. Based on the information in the Monitor’s report, DTLA has requested that the Arbitrator issue an award of back profits and interest and order the sale of LAFI to an independent third party in order to allow any judgment to be paid to DTLA. That request is under submission.
Under GAAP accounting, ownership percentages over 20% would typically be accounted for using the equity method, the Company is accounting for this investment as an investment in
equity securities due to the Company not having significant influence over LAFI. The cost of this investment was expensed during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and, due to uncertainties surrounding the value of LAFI and determining any award of back profits and interest, as well as the pending litigation, no value has been reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021.
Results of Operations
Year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we generated revenues of $12,243 and $16,691, respectively, a decrease of approximately $4,500. We generate five types of revenue, which generally consist of fees from subscriptions, affiliate advertising, event sales, referrals and consulting. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:
Subscription fees. In June 2021, we launched a new Membership Benefits Program under the WeedClub® Platform, where subscribers can connect to ‘exclusive deals’ on essential products and services necessary to scale their business. Our special pricing of $149 for an annual subscription makes access to our WeedClub® Platform available to all.
Affiliate advertising. Affiliate advertising, through our advertising deal with Twitter, generated $8,850 of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. In 2020, we entered into an advertising deal with Twitter which provides us a revenue stream and growth opportunity due to our ability to post approved hemp social media ads. The corresponding costs of revenues associated with affiliate advertising revenues was $8,000 and zero for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Event Sales. The negative impact of COVID-19 resulted in a decrease in our event sales from $2,020 in the prior year to zero in the year ended December 31, 2021. We were able to hold one virtual @420 event during the prior year with a limited number of company presenters. We do not have any current plans to resume our @420 networking events at this time.
Referral fees. We generate referral fees when a business transaction is consummated between us and the potential target company. Such business transactions generally arise from the connections with company presenters during @420 events of which none were held during the
year ended December 31, 2021. Accordingly, our revenues from referral fees declined from $11,250 to $2,500 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Consulting and other. Consulting fees are recognized when we assist presenting companies with their investment deck and presentation scripts for our @420 events of which none were held during the year ended December 31, 2021. Accordingly, such revenues declined from $750 to zero for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, general and administrative expenses were $451,012 and $370,908, respectively, an increase of approximately $80,100. Contributing factors to this increase were:

LAFI. This judgment also appointed a Monitor, to be supervised by the Arbitrator, to determine how much in past profits and interest we are entitled to be awarded. The costs of the Monitor are borne equally between the Company and LAFI. Between July and December 2021, the Monitor undertook a detailed forensic examination of LAFI. The Monitor’s report was completed in January 2022. Reference is made to Note 9, Litigation, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 in this Report for further information on the litigation.
·Legal fees incurred by our predecessor law firm in the LAFI litigation decreased approximately $38,400. This law firm resigned in April 2021 when we engaged a new “contingency-based” law firm.

All professional fees incurred for the year ended December 31, 2021 were comprised of stock-based fees, compared to $37,800 for the prior year ended December 31, 2020.
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles related to Intangible Assets, we determined that the fair market value of our intangible assets to be zero as of December 31, 2020. Accordingly, we incurred a loss on impairment of intangible assets of $455,000 for the prior year ended December 31, 2020. Reference is made to Note 5, Intangible Assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 in this report.
Other (income) and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:
Recovery of expense in litigation. Following the issuance of aforementioned judgment against LAFI, we filed a motion for reimbursement of costs in the amount of $22,382. No objection was filed by LAFI and we received reimbursement of these costs.
Gain on extinguishment. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we settled debt with shares of our common stock which resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt for the difference between the amount of debt settled and the fair value of the shares of common stock issued based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the OTCQB market. For the prior year ended December 31, 2020, we were able to write-off several old accounts payable liabilities from 2018, which resulted in gain on extinguishment of approximately $26,500.
Interest expense. Interest expense decreased by approximately $21,500 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in interest expense was mostly due to interest expense accrued on our unpaid liability to our predecessor law firm in the aforementioned litigation. This law firm resigned in April 2021 when we engaged a new “contingency-based” law firm and started accruing interest expense on their unpaid amount. This decrease was offset by an approximate $1,900 increase in interest expense on borrowings on two loan obligations during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Overall, for the year ended December 31, 2021, we reported a net loss of $975,579 compared to a net loss of $1,045,479 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Considering the $455,000 loss on impairment of our intangible assets, our comparative net loss for the prior year ended December 31, 2020 was $590,479 which, compared to our current year loss, represented an overall increase in net loss of approximately $385,100.
Considering stock-based fees for services rendered by consultants and professionals for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively (as discussed above), our net loss increased by approximately $153,400 from the prior year comparable period, as shown in the following table:
