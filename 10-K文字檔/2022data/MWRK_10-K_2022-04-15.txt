ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations and estimates and assumptions about events and trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position.

Net cash used in operating activities was $4,763,314 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $337,855 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $4,497,672.

Cash Requirements
We expect that we will require $2,400,000, including our current working capital, to fund our operating expenditures for the next twelve months. Projected working capital requirements for the next twelve months are as follows:
Estimated Working Capital Expenditures During the Next Twelve Months
Our estimated general and administrative expenses for the next 12 months are $2,400,000 and are comprised of: consulting fees, accounting services, board of directors and our advisory board, investor relations consultants, and to our public relations and marketing consultants; legal and professional fees (including auditing fees); for insurance; marketing and advertising expenses; trade shows; travel expenses; office rent and miscellaneous and office expenses.
We will require additional cash resources to meet our planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the next 12 months. We expect to derive such cash through the sale of equity or debt securities or by obtaining a credit facility. The sale of additional equity securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness will result in debt service obligations, could cause additional dilution to our stockholders, and could require us to agree to financial covenants that could restrict our operations or modify our plans to source a new business opportunity. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Failure to raise additional funds could cause our company to fail.
Going Concern
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have not yet established a source of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs and to allow us to continue as a going concern. We have incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $35,248,384 as at December 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020: $13,323,375). Our ability to operate as a going concern is dependent on obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until we become profitable.
In its report on our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
