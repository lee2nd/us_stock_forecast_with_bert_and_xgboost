Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations
Management’s discussion
and analysis (“MD&A”) provides supplemental information, which sets forth
the major factors that
have affected our financial condition and results of operations and
should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial
Statements and related notes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The MD&A is divided into subsections entitled
“Business Overview,” “Executive
Overview,” “Results of Operations,”
“Financial Condition,” “Liquidity and Capital Resources,”
“Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements,” and “Accounting Policies.”
The following information should provide a better understanding
of the major factors and trends that affect our earnings performance
and financial condition, and how our performance during
2021 compares with prior years.
Throughout this section, Capital City Bank Group, Inc., and its subsidiaries,
collectively,
are
referred to as “CCBG,” “Company,”
“we,” “us,” or “our.”

BUSINESS OVERVIEW
Our Business
We are a financial
holding company headquartered in Tallahassee,
Florida, and we are the parent of our wholly owned subsidiary,
Capital City Bank (the “Bank” or “CCB”).
We provide
a full range of banking services, including traditional deposit and credit
services, mortgage banking, asset management, trust, merchant services,
bankcards, securities brokerage services and financial
advisory services, including the sale of life insurance, risk management
and asset protection services. The Bank has 57 banking
offices and 86 ATMs/ITMs
in Florida, Georgia and Alabama.
Through Capital City Home Loans, LLC, a Georgia limited
liability company (“CCHL”), we have 26 additional offices
in the Southeast for our mortgage banking business.
Please see the
section captioned “About Us” beginning on page 4 for more detailed information
about our business.
Our profitability, like
most financial institutions, is dependent to a large extent upon net
interest income, which is the difference
between the interest and fees received on interest earning assets, such as loans and
securities, and the interest paid on interest-
bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings.
Results of operations are also affected by the provision for
credit losses,
operating expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy
and other operating expenses including income taxes, and
noninterest income such as mortgage banking revenues, wealth management
fees, deposit fees, and bank card fees.
Strategic Review
Operating Philosophy
.
Our philosophy is to build long-term client relationships based on quality
service, high ethical standards,
and safe and sound banking practices.
We maintain a locally
oriented, community-based focus, which is augmented by
experienced, centralized support in select specialized areas.
Our local market orientation is reflected in our network of banking
office locations, experienced community executives with
a dedicated President for each market, and community boards which
support our focus on responding to local banking needs.
We strive to offer
a broad array of sophisticated products and to provide
quality service by empowering associates to make decisions in their local
markets.
Strategic Initiatives
.
In 2020, we celebrated
our 125
th
anniversary and reflected on our past history and what has fostered our
longevity - client relationships, community service, and our people have
allowed us to evolve, change, and thrive over time.
In
2021, we initiated a new five year strategic plan “2025 In Focus” that will guide
us in the areas of client experience, channel
optimization, market expansion, and culture.
As part of 2025 In Focus, we aim to take our brand of relationship banking to the
next level, further deepen relationships within our communities, expand
into new higher growth markets, diversify our revenue
sources, invest in new technology that will support the expansion of
client relationships and scale within our lines of business and
drive higher profitability.
Markets
.
We maintain a blend
of large and small markets in Florida and Georgia
all in close proximity to major interstate
thoroughfares such as Interstates I-10 and I-75.
Our larger markets include Tallahassee
(Leon County, Florida), Gainesville
(Alachua County, Florida),
Macon (Bibb County,
Georgia),
and Suncoast (Hernando/Pasco/Citrus, Florida).
The larger
employers in these markets are state and local governments, healthcare
providers, educational institutions, and small businesses,
providing stability and good growth dynamics that have historically grown
in excess of the national average.
We serve an
additional fifteen smaller, less competitive,
rural markets located on the outskirts of and centered between our larger
markets
where we are positioned as a market leader.
In 12 of 18 markets in Florida and two of four Georgia markets, we frequently
rank
within the top four banks in terms of deposit market share.
Furthermore, in the counties in which we operate, we maintain an
8.3% deposit market share in the Florida counties and 2.4% in the Georgia
counties.
Our markets provide for a strong core
deposit funding base, a key differentiator and driver of our profitability
and franchise value.
Recent Acquisition/Expansion Activity
.
In 2020, we began our expansion into the western panhandle area of Florida by
opening a
full-service banking office in Bay County,
Florida and a loan production office in Walton
County with plans to open a full-service
banking office in Walton
County in late 2022.
In 2021, we began our expansion plans into the Northern Arc of Atlanta (Gwinne
tt
and Cobb counties) with plans for opening a full-service office
in Gwinnett in late 2022.
Further, we will expand our presence
and commitment to our Gainesville market, opening a third full-service
banking office in early 2023.
Significant progress was
made in 2021 in hiring leadership and banking teams in the Northern Arc and
Walton markets.
On March 1, 2020, CCB completed its acquisition of a 51% membership
interest in Brand Mortgage Group, LLC (“Brand”)
which is now operated as a Capital City Home Loans (“CCHL”) - Refer to
Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies/Business
Combination for additional information on this transaction.
On April 30, 2021, a newly formed subsidiary of CCBG, Capital City Strategic Wealth,
LLC (“CCSW”) acquired substantially all
of the assets of Strategic Wealth
Group, LLC and certain related businesses (“SWG”) - Refer to Note 1 -
Significant Accounting
Policies/Business Combination for additional information
on this transaction.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
For 2021, net income attributable to common shareowners totaled $33.4
million, or $1.98 per diluted share, compared to net
income of $31.6 million, or $1.88 per diluted share for 2020 and $30.8
million, or $1.83 per diluted share, for 2019.
The increase in net income attributable to common shareowners for 2021
was attributable to a decrease in the provision for credit
losses of $11.2 million, higher net interest income
of $1.5 million and lower income taxes of $0.4 million, partially offset
by
higher noninterest expense of $12.5 million and lower noninterest income
of $3.6 million.
Net income attributable to common
shareowners included a $4.9 million decrease in the deduction
to record the 49% non-controlling interest in the earnings of CCHL.
The increase in net income attributable to common shareowners for 2020
reflected higher noninterest income of $58.1 million,
partially offset by higher noninterest expense of $36.4
million, a $7.6 million increase in the provision for credit losses, lower net
interest income of $2.0 million, and higher income taxes of $0.2
million.
Net income attributable to common shareowners
included an $11.1 million deduction
to record the 49% non-controlling interest in the earnings of CCHL which was fully
consolidated in CCBG’s financial
statements on March 1, 2020.
Below are
Summary Highlights
that impacted our performance for 2021:
●
2021 net income attributable to common shareowners
totaled $33.4 million, a record
year
●
Operating revenues (excluding mortgage
revenues and SBA PPP loan income) improved
1.4%
●
CCHL contributed $0.23 per share versus $0.52
per share in 2020
●
Average loans, excluding PPP loans,
grew $76 million and average investment securities increased
$203 million
●
Negative credit loss provision
of $1.6 million
●
Noninterest expense included pension
settlement charges totaling $3.1 million or $0.15 per share
●
Average Deposits grew
$563 million, or 19.8%, reflective of government
stimulus related inflows
●
Capital growth of $62.3 million ($3.69 per share),
or 19.4%, reflective of strong earnings
and a favorable adjustment of
$34.1 million related to our year-end
pension plan re-measurement

Net Interest Income
Net interest income represents our single largest source of earnings
and is equal to interest income and fees generated by earning
assets, less interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities.
We provide
an analysis of our net interest income, including
average yields and rates in Tables
2 and 3 below.
We provide this information
on a "taxable equivalent" basis to reflect the tax-
exempt status of income earned on certain loans and investments.
For 2021, our taxable equivalent net interest income increased $1.5
million, or 1.4%. This follows a decrease of $2.1 million, or
2.0% in 2020.
The increase in 2021 was primarily
due to higher small business (“SBA PPP”) loan income combined
with a lower
cost of funds, partially offset by lower income from the investment
portfolio due to lower reinvestment rates. The decrease in
2020 was driven primarily by lower rates for most of the year,
which negatively impacted our variable and adjustable rate earning
assets.
Partially offsetting this decline was a lower cost of funds.
For 2021, taxable equivalent interest income increased $0.1 million,
or 0.1%, over 2020.
For 2020, taxable equivalent interest
income decreased $6.7 million, or 5.9%, from 2019.
The increase in 2021
was primarily due to fee income on SBA PPP loans
partially offset by lower rates on earning assets. The decline
in 2020 was primarily due to lower rates on earning assets.
For 2021, interest expense decreased $1.4 million, or 28.4%, from 2020.
For 2020, interest expense decreased $4.6 million, or
48.7%, from 2019.
The decline in both years was primarily due to lower rates on our negotiated rate
deposits which are tied to an
adjustable rate index.
Our cost of funds decreased six basis points to 10 basis points in 2021 and decreased
19 basis points to 16
basis points in 2020.
The decrease in both years was primarily due to lower interest rates paid on our negotiated
rate products.
Our interest rate spread (defined as the taxable-equivalent yield
on average earning assets less the average rate paid on interest
bearing liabilities) decreased 43 basis points in 2021 and decreased 43
basis points in 2020.
Our net interest margin (defined as
taxable-equivalent interest income less interest expense divided by average
earning assets) of 2.83% in 2021 was a 47 basis point
decrease from 2020.
The net interest margin of 3.30% in 2020 was a 55 basis point decrease from
2019.
The decline in the
interest rate spread and net interest margin in both years was primarily
due to lower yielding earning assets due to lower rates, in
addition to strong growth in lower yielding overnight funds.
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) did not change the federal funds
target rate range of 0.00% - 0.25% during 2021.
As 2021 progressed, the market began to anticipate more aggressive rate increases
for 2022 than initially expected, ending 2021
with estimates of three rate increases of 25 basis points each by the end of 2022.
As we continue to closely monitor and manage
our net interest margin,
we review and implement various loan strategies that align with our overall
risk appetite to enhance our
performance on an ongoing basis.
We continue
to maintain relatively short duration portfolios on both sides of the
Statement of
Financial Condition and believe we are well positioned to respond to changing
market conditions.

This table shows the change in taxable equivalent net interest income for comparative periods based on either changes in average volume
or changes in average rates for interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Changes which are not solely due to volume
changes or solely due to rate changes have been attributed to rate changes. SBA PPP loan income totaled $7.9 million in 2021 and
$3.2 million in 2020.
(2)
Interest income includes the effects of taxable equivalent adjustments using a 21% tax rate to adjust on tax-exempt loans and securities
and securities to a taxable equivalent basis.

Provision for Credit Losses
For 2021, we recorded a provision benefit of $1.6 million ($2.8 million benefit
for loans HFI and $1.2 million expense for
unfunded loan commitments)
compared to provision expense of $9.6 million for 2020 ($9.0 million expense
for loans HFI and
$0.6 million expense for unfunded loan commitments), and $2.0
million for 2019.
Prior to 2020, the provision for unfunded loan
commitments was recorded in other expense.
We discuss the various
factors that have impacted our provision expense in more
detail under the heading Allowance for Credit Losses.
Noninterest Income
For 2021, noninterest income totaled $107.5 million, a $3.6 million
decrease from 2020 primarily attributable to lower mortgage
banking revenues of $10.9 million, partially offset by
strong gains in wealth management fees of $2.7 million, bank card fees of
$2.2 million, and deposit fees of $1.1 million.
The decline in mortgage banking revenues was driven generally by lower
refinancing activity,
a shift in production mix (lower government versus conventional product), and
lower market driven gain on
sale margins.
The increase in deposit fees reflected the conversion, in the third quarter of
2021, of the remaining free checking
accounts to a monthly maintenance fee account type.
The increase in wealth management fees was primarily attributable to
higher retail brokerage transaction volume and advisory accounts added
from the acquisition of Capital City Strategic Wealth
on
April 30, 2021.
To a lesser extent, higher trust fees contributed
to the increase in wealth management fees driven by higher assets
under management.
The increase in bank card fees generally reflected an increase in card-not-present debit
card transactions and
increased consumer spending.
For 2020, noninterest income totaled $111.2
million, a $58.1 million increase over 2019 primarily attributable to higher mortgage
banking revenues of $58.0 million added through the strategic alliance with CCHL.
Deposit fees declined $1.7 million primarily
due to the impact of government stimulus in the second quarter related
to the COVID-19 pandemic,
but improved for the second
half of the year due to higher utilization of our overdraft product.
Strong debit card fee growth of $1.0 million and a $0.6 million
increase in wealth management fees significantly offset the aforementioned
decline in deposit fees.
Noninterest income as a percent of total operating revenues (net interest income plus
noninterest income) was 51.11%
in 2021,
52.32% in 2020, and 33.92% in 2019.
The addition of CCHL mortgage banking revenues was the primary factor
driving the
improvement in this metric in 2020.
In 2021, lower mortgage banking revenues drove the decrease in the percentage
.
The table
below reflects the major components of noninterest income.

Significant components of noninterest income are discussed in more
detail below.
Deposit Fees
.
For 2021, deposit fees (service charge fees, insufficient
fund/overdraft fees (“NSF/OD”), and business account
analysis fees) totaled $18.9 million compared to $17.8 million in 2020
and $19.5 million in 2019.
The $1.1 million, or 6.1%,
increase in 2021 reflected the conversion, in the third quarter of 2021, of the remaining
free checking accounts to a monthly
maintenance fee account type.
The $1.7 million, or 8.6%, decrease in 2020 was attributable to lower NSF/OD fees and
reflected
the impact of significant government stimulus in the second quarter
related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
For the second quarter of
2020, fees were down $1.3 million compared to the first quarter of 2020
and reflected lower utilization of our overdraft product as
consumer and business demand for this service was reduced by the impact
of the significant cash stimulus provided by the
economic impact payments (EIP) and SBA PPP loans.
The decline in fees realized in the second quarter reversed in the third and
fourth quarters of 2020 as employment conditions and economic activity
began to recover resulting in higher utilization of our
overdraft product.
Bank Card Fees
.
Bank card fees totaled $15.3 million in 2021 compared to $13.0 million in 2020
and $12.0 million in 2019.
Bank card fees reflected strong growth in 2021 and 2020 and generally
reflected an increase in card-not-present debit card
transactions and increased on-line spending by our clients.
An account acquisition initiative that began in early 2019 and various
debit and credit card promotions have also contributed to the increases.
Wealth
Management Fees
.
Wealth management fees
including both trust fees (i.e., managed accounts and trusts/estates) and
retail brokerage fees (i.e., investment, insurance products, and retirement
accounts) totaled $13.7 million in 2021 compared to
$11.0 million in 2020 and $10.5 million in 201
9.
The increase in fees for 2021 reflected higher retail brokerage fees of $1.8
million and trust fees of $0.8 million.
Higher retail brokerage transaction volume and advisory accounts added from
the
acquisition of Capital City Strategic Wealth
on April 30, 2021 drove the increase in retail brokerage fees.
The increase in trust
fees was primarily attributable to an increase in assets under management.
The increase in fees for 2020 was attributable to a $0.3
million increase in retail brokerage fees and a $0.2 million increase in trust fees.
Higher transactions volumes and the addition of
new investment advisors drove the increase in retail brokerage fees in 2020.
Growth in assets under management contributed to
the growth in trust fees in 2020.
At December 31, 2021, total assets under management were approximately
$2.324 billion
compared to $1.979 billion at December 31, 2020 and $1.774 billion
at December 31, 2019.
Mortgage Banking Revenues
.
Mortgage banking revenues totaled $52.4 million in 2021 compared
to $63.3 million in 2020 and
$5.3 million in 2019.
The decrease in 2021 was driven generally by lower refinancing volume,
a shift in production mix (lower
government versus conventional product), and lower market driven gain
on sale margins.
The increase in 2020 reflected revenues
added from the strategic alliance with CCHL and the favorable impact
that the lower residential mortgage rate environment had
on home purchase,
construction, and refinancing activity in our combined markets.
We provide a detailed
overview of our
mortgage banking operation,
including a detailed break-down of mortgage banking revenues, mortgage
servicing activity, and
warehouse
funding within Note 4 - Mortgage Banking Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Production
volume totaled $1.52 billion in 2021 and $1.56 billion in 2020.
Refinancing activity represented 30% of loan production in 2021
and 40% in 2020.
CCHL contributed approximately $3.9 million to CCBG consolidated earnings
in 2021 and $8.7 million in
2020.
Other
.
Other noninterest income totaled $7.3 million in 2021 compared to $5.9 million
in 2020 and $5.8 million in 2019.
The
$1.4 million increase in 2021 was primarily attributable to higher servicing
fees of $1.0 million at CCHL reflecting a higher
volume of servicing retained loan sales in 2021.
The $0.1 million favorable variance in 2020 reflected higher loan servicing fees
added by CCHL substantially offset by lower loan related
activity based fees.
Noninterest Expense
For 2021, noninterest expense totaled $162.5 million compared to
$150.0 million for 2020.
The $12.5 million increase was
attributable to the addition of expenses at CCHL (March 1, 2020
acquisition) of $2.3 million and higher expenses at the core bank
totaling $10.2 million.
The increase in expenses at the core bank were primarily due to higher compensation
expense of $3.7
million (merit raises, pension/service cost expense, and realized loan
cost), pension settlement expense of $3.1 million, and an
increase in other expense of $5.0 million, partially offset
by lower other real estate (“ORE”) expense of $1.6 million.
The
increase in other expense was primarily attributable to higher expense
of $2.1 million for the non-service cost component of our
pension plan attributable to the utilization of a lower discount rate for plan
liabilities.
Higher processing fees of $0.7 million
(debit card volume), professional fees of $0.6 million, occupancy expense
of $0.5 million, and FDIC insurance of $0.5 million
(higher asset size) also contributed to the increase in other expense.
For 2020, noninterest expense totaled $150.0 million, an increase of $36.4
million over 2019 primarily attributable to the addition
of expenses at CCHL, including compensation expense of $32.4 million,
occupancy expense of $2.8 million, and other expense of
$4.8 million.
Core CCBG noninterest expense decreased $3.6 million and reflected lower compensation
expense of $2.5 million,
ORE expense of $0.4 million, and other expense of $2.2 million, partially
offset by higher occupancy expense of $1.5 million.
The decrease in compensation expense was primarily attributable to lower
commission expense of $2.2 million related to the
transfer of our legacy mortgage production division to CCHL and,
to a lesser extent, higher realized loan cost of $0.4 million
related to the aforementioned increase in SBA PPP loan originations.
A $1.0 million gain from the sale of a banking office in the
first quarter of 2020 drove the reduction in ORE expense.
The decline in other expense was primarily attributable to lower
service cost expense for our pension plan.
Higher expense for furniture, fixtures and equipment (“FF&E”)
depreciation and
maintenance agreements (related to technology investment
and upgrades), higher than normal premises maintenance, and
pandemic related cleaning/supply costs drove the increas
e
in occupancy.
Our operating efficiency ratio (expressed as noninterest
expense as a percent of taxable equivalent net interest income plus
noninterest income) was 77.11%, 70.43%
and 72.40% in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The increase in this metric for 2021
reflected higher noninterest expense, largely
the aforementioned higher level of pension plan expenses.
The improvement in this
metric in 2020 was primarily attributable to higher noninterest income driven
by our strategic alliance with CCHL.
Expense management is an important part of our culture and strategic focus.
We will continue
to review and evaluate
opportunities to optimize our delivery operations and invest in
technology that provides
favorable returns/scale and/or mitigates
risk.
The table below reflects the major components of noninterest expense.

Significant components of noninterest expense are discussed in more detail
below.
Compensation
.
Compensation expense totaled $101.5 million in 2021, $96.3 million in 2020,
and $66.4 million in 2019.
For
2021, the $5.2 million, or 5.4%, increase was attributable to higher
salary expense of $4.4 million and associate benefit expense
of $0.8 million.
Higher salary expense of $3.1 million and associate benefit expense of $0.6 million
at the core bank drove a
majority of the increase with the addition of CCHL compensation expense for
a full 12 month period in 2021 versus 10 months in
2020 driving the remaining portion of the variance.
The higher level of salary expense at the core bank reflected higher base
salaries of $1.8 million, primarily merit raises, and lower realized loan
cost of $0.8 million (credit offset to salary expense).
The
increase in associate benefit expense was attributable to higher pension plan
service cost of $1.1 million partially offset by lower
associate insurance expense of $0.4 million.
For 2020, the $29.9 million, or 45.1%, increase in compensation expense reflected
the addition of $32.4 million in compensation
expense from CCHL.
Core bank compensation expense declined by $2.5 million, primarily attributable
to lower commission
expense of $2.2 million (transfer of residential mortgage operations to
CCHL), higher realized loan cost of $0.4 million and lower
associate benefit expense of $0.9 million (primarily stock compensation
and to a lesser extent associate insurance), partially offset
by higher cash incentives of $0.2 million, base salaries of $0.3 million,
and contractual employment of $0.3 million (tax advisory
services for CCHL transaction).
Occupancy
.
Occupancy expense (including premises and equipment) totaled $23.9 million for
2021, $22.7 million for 2020, and
$18.4 million for 2019.
For 2021, the $1.2 million, or 5.3%, increase was attributable to higher occupancy
expense at the core
bank of $0.5 million with the remainder of the variance reflective of CCHL occupancy
expense for a full 12 month period versus
10 months in 2020.
The increase at the core bank was attributable to higher FF&E depreciation and software license expense
and
reflected additional ATM
/ITM investments and other systems infrastructure investments for business line
support and risk
management.
For 2020, the $4.3 million, or 23.4%, increase reflected the addition
of $2.8 million in occupancy expense from CCHL.
Core
bank occupancy expense increased $1.5 million primarily due to
higher FF&E depreciation and maintenance agreement expense
(related to technology investment and upgrades), maintenance for
premises, and pandemic related cleaning/supply costs.
Pandemic related costs reflected in occupancy expense for 2020 at the core bank
totaled approximately $0.3 million and will
phase out over a period of time as the pandemic subsides.
Other
.
Other noninterest expense totaled $37.1 million in 2021, $31.0 million
in 2020, and $28.8 million in 2019.
For 2021, the
$6.1 million, or 19.7%, increase was driven by higher other expenses at the core
bank of $5.9 million, primarily higher
miscellaneous expense of $2.1 million for the non-service cost component
of our pension plan attributable to the utilization of a
lower discount rate for plan liabilities.
Additionally, we incurred
a $3.1 million pension settlement charge in 2021 related to a
high level of lump sum payments to 2021 retirees.
We could realize additional
pension settlement expense in 2022 should we
experience a higher than normal level of retirements.
Higher processing fees of $0.7 million (debit card volume),
professional
fees of $0.6 million (temporary staffing support),
and FDIC insurance premiums of $0.5 million (larger asset size),
partially offset
by lower ORE expense of $1.6 million (gains from the sale of banking
offices) contributed to the increase.
For 2020, the $2.2 million, or 7.6%, increase in other expense reflected
the addition of $4.8 million in expenses from CCHL
partially offset by a $2.6 million decrease in other expenses at the core
bank.
Lower pension plan expense of $1.9 million (higher
unrealized gain amortization due to a lower discount rate for pension
liability), ORE expense of $0.4 million (primarily due to a
$1.0 million gain from the sale of a banking office),
and travel/entertainment expense of $0.4 million (partially due to lower travel
during pandemic) drove the decrease in other expenses at the core bank.
Income Taxes
For 2021, we realized income tax expense of $9.8 million (effective
rate of 20%) compared to $10.2 million (effective
rate of
19%) for 2020 and $9.9 million (effective rate of 24%)
for 2019.
The increase in our effective tax rate in 2021 was attributable to
a decrease in CCHL income.
The decrease in our effective tax rate in 2020 reflected
the impact of converting CCHL to a
partnership for tax purposes.
In addition, 2020 income taxes reflected net discrete tax expense items totaling $0.3
million.
Absent discrete items, we expect our annual effective tax rate
to approximate 19%-20% in 2022.
In September 2019, Florida enacted a corporate tax rate reduction from 5.5%
to 4.5% retroactive to January 1, 2019.
As a result,
our deferred tax accounts were re-measured resulting in a discrete tax expense
of $0.4 million.
In September 2021, Florida
enacted a corporate tax rate reduction from 4.5% to 3.535% retroactive
to January 1, 2021 with an expiration date of December
31, 2021, therefore, there was no material impact to our deferred
tax accounts.
Our 2021, 2020, and 2019 state tax rate was
adjusted to reflect the one percentage point (2019 and 2020) and two percentage
point (2021) reductions each year.
Absent
legislative action, the Florida tax rate will revert to 5.5% effective January
1, 2022.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Average assets totaled
approximately $3.984 billion for 2021, an increase of $593.0
million, or 17.5%, over 2020.
Average
earning assets were approximately $3.652 billion for 2021, an increase
of $568.8 million, or 18.4%, over 2020.
Compared to
2020, average overnight funds increased $325.2 million, while investment
securities increased $203.4 million and average loans
held for investment were higher by $43.0 million.
We discuss these variances
in more detail below.
Table 2 provides
information on average balances and rates, Table
3 provides an analysis of rate and volume variances and Table
6 highlights the changing mix of our interest earning assets over the last three years.
Loans
In 2021, average loans HFI increased $43.0 million, or 2.2%, compared to
an increase of $145.8 million, or 8.1%, in 2020.
Compared to 2020, we realized average growth in all categories except
institutional loans, commercial loans, and home equity
loans.
For 2021, SBA PPP loans averaged $92.5 million, a decrease of $32.9 million
from 2020. At December 31, 2021, SBA
PPP loans totaled $0.1 million.
In 2021, average loans held for sale (“HFS”) decreased $2.8 million from
2020 due to lower volume of loans sold from CCHL.
Loans HFI and HFS as a percentage of average earning assets decreased to
56.9% in 2021 compared to 66.1% in 2020 and 67.6%
in 2019, primarily attributable to higher levels of overnight funds due to growth
in deposits.
We continue
to make minor modifications on some of our lending programs to mitigate the impact
that consumer and business
deleveraging has had on our portfolio.
These programs, coupled with economic improvements in our anchor markets and
loan
purchases, have helped to increase overall loan growth.
We will periodically
purchase newly originated 1-4 family real estate secured adjustable rate loans
from CCHL. The strategic
alliance with CCHL provides us a larger pool of loan purchase opportunities,
including participation loans for construction/perm
product.

Our average total loans (HFS and HFI)-to-deposit ratio was 61.0%
in 2021, 71.7% in 2020, and 71.8% in 2019.
The composition of our HFI loan portfolio at December 31
st
for each of the past three years is shown in Table

Table 8 arrays
our HFI loan portfolio at December 31, 2021, by maturity period.
As a percentage of the HFI loan portfolio, loans with fixed
interest rates represented 39.3% at December 31, 2021 compared to 42.4% at December
31, 2020.
This decline occurred in our
fixed rate loans, primarily due to the payoff of PPP loans, which are
short-term in nature.

the last three years.
Information regarding our accounting policies related to nonaccruals, past due
loans, and troubled debt
restructurings is provided in Note 3 - Loans Held for Investment and
Allowance for Credit Losses.
Overall credit quality continues to remain strong.
Nonperforming assets (nonaccrual loans and other real estate) totaled $4.3
million at December 31, 2021 compared to $6.7 million at December
31, 2020.
At December 31, 2021, nonperforming assets as a
percentage of total assets was stable at 0.10%.
Nonaccrual loans totaled $4.3 million at December 31, 2021, a $1.5 million
decrease from December 31, 2020.

included in NALs at December 31, 2021,
December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
Nonaccrual Loans
.
Nonaccrual loans totaled $4.3 million at December 31, 2021, a $1.5 million decrease
from December 31,
2020.
Gross additions to nonaccrual status during 2021 totaled $7.3 million
compared to $11.4 million in 2020.
Generally, loans are placed
on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments become 90 days past due or management
deems
the collectability of the principal and interest to be doubtful.
Once a loan is placed in nonaccrual status, all previously accrued
and uncollected interest is reversed against interest income.
Interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized when the ultimate
collectability is no longer considered doubtful.
Loans are returned to accrual status when the principal and interest amounts
contractually due are brought current or when future payments are reasonably
assured.
If interest on our loans classified as
nonaccrual during 2021 had been recognized on a fully accruing basis, we would
have recorded an additional $0.2 million of
interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Other Real Estate Owned
.
OREO represents property acquired as the result of borrower defaults
on loans or by receiving a deed
in lieu of foreclosure.
OREO is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs, at the
time of
foreclosure.
Write-downs occurring at foreclosure are
charged against the allowance for credit losses.
On an ongoing basis,
properties are either revalued internally or by a third party appraiser as required
by applicable regulations.
Subsequent declines in
value are reflected as other noninterest expense.
Carrying costs related to maintaining the OREO properties are expensed as
incurred and are also reflected as other noninterest expense.
OREO totaled $0.02 million at December 31, 2021 versus $0.8 million
at December 31, 2020.
During 2021, we added properties
totaling $1.7 million, sold properties totaling $2.8 million, and recorded
net favorable valuation adjustments totaling $0.3 million.
For 2020, we added properties totaling $2.3 million, sold properties totaling
$1.7 million, and recorded valuation adjustments
totaling $0.8
million.
Troubled
Debt Restructurings.
TDRs are loans on which, due to the deterioration in the borrower’s financial
condition, the
original terms have been modified and deemed a concession to the borrower.
From time to time we will modify a loan as a
workout alternative.
Most of these instances involve an extension of the loan term, an interest rate reduction, or
a principal
moratorium.
A TDR classification can be removed if the borrower’s financial
condition improves such that the borrower is no
longer in financial difficulty,
the loan has not had any forgiveness of principal or interest, and the loan is subsequently
refinanced
or restructured at market terms and qualifies as a new loan in calendar years after
the year in which the restructuring took place.
Loans classified as TDRs at December 31, 2021 totaled $8.0 million compared
to $14.3 million at December 31, 2020.
Accruing
TDRs made up approximately $7.6 million of our TDR portfolio at December
31, 2021 of which $0.8 million was over 30 days
past due.
The weighted average rate for the loans within the accruing TDR portfolio was 5.54%.
During 2021, we modified three
loan contracts totaling approximately $0.6
million compared to three loan contracts totaling approximately $0.2 million during
2020.
Our TDR default rate (default balance as a percentage of average TDRs) in 2021 and
2020 was 4.1% and 2.9%,
respectively.
COVID Loan Extensions
.
To assist our clients during
the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in March 2020, we began allowing
short term 60 to 90 day loan extensions for affected borrowers.
We have extended
loans totaling $333 million of which
approximately 75% were for commercial borrowers and 25% were for
consumer borrowers.
At December 31, 2020,
approximately $324 million, or 97% of the loan balances associated with these
borrowers resumed making regularly scheduled
payments.
In 2021, this extension program was discontinued,
and to date there have been a nominal level of defaults related to
this loan pool.
Past Due Loans
.
A loan is defined as a past due loan when one full payment is past due or a contractual maturity
is over 30 days
past due.
Past due loans at December 31, 2021 totaled $3.6 million compared to $4.6
million at December 31, 2020.
Potential Problem Loans
.
Potential problem loans are defined as those loans which are now current but where management
has
doubt as to the borrower’s ability to comply with present
loan repayment terms.
At December 31, 2021, we had $1.5 million in
loans of this type which were not included in either of the nonaccrual, TDR or
90 day past due loan categories compared to $2.3
million at December 31, 2020.
Management monitors these loans closely and reviews their performance
on a regular basis.
Loan Concentrations
.
Loan concentrations exist when there are amounts loaned to multiple borrowers engaged
in similar
activities which cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions
and such amount exceeds 10% of total
loans.
Due to the lack of diversified industry within our markets and the relatively close proximity
of the markets, we have both
geographic concentrations as well as concentrations in the types of loans funded.
Specifically, due to the nature of our markets,
a
significant portion of our HFI loan portfolio has historically been
secured with real estate, approximately 72% at December 31,
2021 and 67% at December 31, 2020.
This percentage increased in 2021
due to the lower balance in the commercial loan
category which reflected $178 million in SBA PPP loans at December 31,
2020.
The primary types of real estate collateral are
commercial properties and 1-4 family residential properties.
We have established
an internal lending limit of $10 million for the total aggregate amount of credit
that will be extended to a
client and any related entities within our Board approved policies.
This compares to our legal lending limit of approximately $87
million.
The following table summarizes our real estate loan category as segregated
by the type of property.
Property type concentrations
are stated as a percentage of December 31
st
total real estate loans.

A major portion of our real estate loan category is centered in the owner occupied
category which carries a lower risk of non-
collection than certain segments of the investor category.
Approximately 42% of the investor real estate category was secured by
residential real estate at December 31, 2021.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from
the loans’ amortized cost basis to present the net
amount expected to be collected on the loans.
The allowance for credit losses is adjusted by a credit loss provision which is
reported in earnings and reduced by the charge-off
of loan amounts, net of recoveries.
Loans are charged off against the
allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan
balance is confirmed.
Expected recoveries do not exceed the
aggregate
of amounts previously charged-off and expected
to be charged-off.
Expected credit loss inherent in non-cancellable
off-balance sheet credit exposures is provided through the credit
loss provision, but recorded as a separate liability included in
other liabilities.
Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available
information, from internal and external sources, relating to
past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.
Historical loan default and loss experience provides the
basis for the estimation of expected credit losses.
Adjustments to historical loss information incorporate management’s
view of
current conditions and forecasts.
Detailed information regarding the methodology for estimating
the amount reported in the allowance for credit losses is provided
in Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies/Allowance for Credit Losses in
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Note 3 - Loans Held for Investment and Allowance for Credit Losses in the
Consolidated Financial Statements provides the
activity in the allowance and the allocation by loan type for each of
the past three years.
For 2021, we realized net loan recoveries totaling $0.6 million,
or 0.03%, of average HFI loans, compared to net loan charge-offs
of $2.4 million, or 0.12%, for 2020, and $2.3 million, or 0.13%, for 201
9.
At December 31, 2021, the allowance represented
1.12% of HFI loans and provided coverage of 500% of nonperforming
loans compared to 1.19% and 406%, respectively,
at
December 31, 2020 and 0.75% and 311%, respectively,
at December 31, 2019.
At December 31, 2020, excluding SBA PPP loans
(100% government guaranteed), the allowance represented 1.30%
of loans held for investment.
SBA PPP loans at December 31,
2021 were $0.1 million.
At December 31, 2021, the allowance for credit losses totaled $21.6
million compared to $23.8 million at December 31, 2020 and
$13.9 million at December 31, 2019.
The $2.2 million decrease in the allowance for credit losses in 2021 reflected improvements
in forecasted economic conditions, favorable loan migration and net
loan recoveries totaling $0.6 million, partially offset by
incremental reserves needed for loan growth (excluding
SBA PPP).
The $9.9 million increase in the allowance for credit losses in
2020 was attributable to the build of reserves attributable to a deterioration
in economic conditions, primarily a higher rate of
unemployment due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential effect
on rates of default.
The adoption of Accounting Standards
Codification 326 (“CECL”) on January 1, 2020 had an impact of $4.0
million ($3.3 million increase in the allowance for credit
losses and $0.7 million increase in the allowance for unfunded loan commitments,
which is recorded in other liabilities.

Investment Securities
Our average investment portfolio balance increased $203.4
million, or 35.1%, in 2021 and decreased $57.7 million, or 9.1%, in
2020.
As a percentage of average earning assets, our investment portfolio represented
21.4% in 2021, compared to 18.8% in
2020.
In 2021, the growth in the investment portfolio was primarily attributable to an investment
purchase program implemented
to take advantage of higher rates and deploy a portion of our excess liquidity.
We continue to
review various investment strategies
to prudently deploy our excess overnight funds.
In 2021, average taxable investments increased $204.8 million,
or 35.7%, while tax-exempt investments decreased $1.4 million,
or 26.4%.
Taxable bonds increased
as part of our overall investment strategy,
and non-taxable investments decreased as the tax-
equivalent yield was generally unattractive throughout 2021
compared to taxable investments. At December 31, 2021, municipal
securities (taxable and non-taxable) comprised 4.7% of the portfolio.
We may consider
the purchase of municipal issues if the
yields become more attractive compared to taxable securities, or if they are
CRA-eligible investments.
Our investment portfolio is a significant component of our operations and, as such,
it functions as a key element of liquidity and
asset/liability management.
Two types of classifications
are approved for investment securities which are Available
-for-Sale
(“AFS”) and Held-for-Maturity (“HTM”).
In 2021 and 2020, we purchased securities under both the AFS and
HTM designations.
At December 31, 2021, $654.6 million, or 65.8% of our investment portfolio
was classified as AFS, with $339.6 million, or
34.1%, classified as HTM.
At December 31, 2020, the AFS and HTM portfolio comprised 65.7% and 34.3%,
respectively.

The classification of a security is determined upon acquisition based
on how the purchase will affect our asset/liability strategy
and future business plans and opportunities.
Classification determinations will also factor in regulatory capital requirements,
volatility in earnings or other comprehensive income, and liquidity
needs.
Securities in the AFS portfolio are recorded at fair
value with unrealized gains and losses associated with these securities recorded
net of tax, in the accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) component of shareowners’ equity.
Securities designated as HTM are those acquired or owned with
the intent of holding them to maturity (final payment date).
HTM investments are measured at amortized cost.
It is neither
management’s current
intent nor practice to participate in the trading of investment securities for the purpose of recognizing
gains
and therefore we do not maintain a trading portfolio.
At December 31, 2021, there were 401 positions (combined AFS and HTM)
with unrealized losses totaling $10.2 million.
GNMA mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Treasuries,
and SBA securities carry the full faith and credit guarantee of the U.S.
Government, and are 0% risk-weighted assets.
A large portion of the SBA securities float monthly or quarterly
with the prime
rate and are uncapped. None of these positions with unrealized losses are considered
credit impaired, and all are expected to
mature at par.
See Note 2 - Investment Securities for our unrealized losses by security type.
The average maturity of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2021
was 3.62 years compared to 2.09 years at December 31,
2020.
Balances of all security types increased over the prior year,
with the exception of SBA securities.
The average life of our
investment portfolio increased as longer duration securities were purchased
to take advantage of the steeper yield-curve during
2021. See Table
13 for a break-down of maturities by investment type.
The weighted average taxable equivalent yield of our investment portfolio
at December 31, 2021 was 1.12% versus 1.77% in
2020.
This decrease in yield reflected lower reinvestment rates during 2021. Our bond
portfolio contained no investments in
obligations, other than U.S. Governments, of any state, municipality,
political subdivision or any other issuer that exceeded 10%
of our shareowners’ equity at December 31, 2021.
Table 13 and Note 2
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements present a detailed analysis of our
investment securities as
to type, maturity and yield at December 31.

Deposits and Short Term
Borrowings
Average total
deposits for 2021 were $3.407 billion, an increase of $562.5 million, or 19.8%, over
2020.
Average deposits
increased $306.9 million, or 12.1%, from 2019 to 2020.
Both year-over-year increases occurred in all deposit types except
certificates of deposit, with the largest increases occurring
in noninterest bearing,
NOW accounts, and savings accounts.
Strong deposit growth occurred during the year reflecting federal stimulus
inflows as well as core deposit growth. In addition, the
seasonal growth of public funds occurred in the fourth quarter of 2021
and is expected to continue into the first quarter of 2022.
Deposit levels remain strong as we continue to see growth in our non-maturity deposits.
Our mix of deposits continues to improve
as certificates of deposit are replaced with noninterest bearing demand
accounts.
We continue
to closely monitor several metrics such as the sensitivity of our deposit rates, our overall liquidity
position, and
competitor rates when pricing deposits. This strategy is consistent with previous
rate cycles and allows us to manage the mix of
our deposits rather than compete on rate. We
believe this enabled us to maintain a low cost of funds (interest expense/average
earning assets) of nine basis points for 2021 and 16 basis points for
2020.
Table 2 provides
an analysis of our average deposits, by category,
and average rates paid thereon for each of the last three years.
Table 14 reflects the
shift in our deposit mix over the last year and Table
15 provides a maturity distribution of time deposits in
denominations
of $250,000 and over at December 31, 2021.
Average short
-term borrowings decreased $15.6 million in 2021 due to the decline in warehouse line borrowings
at CCHL that
are used to support our held for sale loan portfolio.
See Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional
information on short-term borrowings.
We continue
to focus on the value of our deposit franchise, which produces a strong base of core deposits with
minimal reliance
on wholesale funding.

Market Risk and Interest Rate Sensitivity
Overview.
Market risk arises from changes in interest rates, exchange rates,
commodity prices, and equity prices.
We have risk
management policies designed to monitor and limit exposure to market
risk and we do not participate in activities that give rise to
significant market risk involving exchange rates, commodity prices, or
equity prices.
In asset and liability management activities,
our policies are designed to minimize structural interest rate risk.
Interest Rate Risk Management.
Our net income is largely dependent on net interest income.
Net interest income is susceptible to
interest rate risk to the degree that interest-bearing liabilities mature
or reprice on a different basis than interest-earning
assets.
When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than
interest-earning assets in a given period, a significant
increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income.
Similarly, when interest-earning
assets mature or
reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling market
interest rates could result in a decrease in net interest
income.
Net interest income is also affected by changes in the portion of interest-earning
assets that are funded by interest-
bearing liabilities rather than by other sources of funds, such as noninterest
-bearing deposits and shareowners’ equity.
We have established
what we believe to be a comprehensive interest rate risk management policy,
which is administered by
management’s Asset Liability Management
Committee (“ALCO”).
The policy establishes limits of risk, which are quantitative
measures of the percentage change in net interest income (a measure of net
interest income at risk) and the fair value of equity
capital (a measure of economic value of equity (“EVE”) at risk) resulting
from a hypothetical change in interest rates for
maturities from one day to 30 years.
We measure the
potential adverse impacts that changing interest rates may have on our
short-term earnings, long-term value, and liquidity by employing
simulation analysis through the use of computer modeling.
The
simulation model captures optionality factors such as call features and
interest rate caps and floors imbedded in investment and
loan portfolio contracts.
As with any method of gauging interest rate risk, there are certain shortcomings inherent
in the interest
rate modeling methodology used by us.
When interest rates change, actual movements in different categories
of interest-earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities, loan prepayments, and withdrawals
of time and other deposits, may deviate significantly
from assumptions used in the model.
Finally, the methodology does not
measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have
on adjustable-rate loan clients’ ability to service their debts, or the impact of
rate changes on demand for loan and deposit
products.
The statement of financial condition is subject to testing for interest rate
shock possibilities to indicate the inherent interest rate
risk.
We prepare
a current base case and several alternative interest rate simulations (-100,+100, +200, +300,
and +400 basis
points (bp)), at least once per quarter,
and report the analysis to ALCO, our Market Risk Oversight Committee (“MROC”), our
Enterprise Risk Oversight Committee (“EROC”) and the Board of Directors.
(The -200bp rate scenario was not modeled starting
in the second half of 2019 due to the low interest rate environment below 2.00%).
We augment our interest
rate shock analysis
with alternative interest rate scenarios on a quarterly basis that may include ramps,
parallel shifts, and a flattening or steepening of
the yield curve (non-parallel shift).
In addition, more frequent forecasts may be produced when interest rates are particularly
uncertain or when other business conditions so dictate.
Our goal is to structure the statement of financial condition so that net interest earnings at risk over
12-month and 24-month
periods and the economic value of equity at risk do not exceed policy guidelines
at the various interest rate shock levels. We
attempt to achieve this goal by balancing, within policy limits, the volume
of floating-rate liabilities with a similar volume of
floating-rate assets, by keeping the average maturity of fixed-rate asset and liability
contracts reasonably matched, by managing
the mix of our core deposits, and by adjusting our rates to market conditions on
a continuing basis. At December 31, 2019, the
instantaneous
rate shock of down 100 bp over 24-months was slightly outside of desired parameters
due to limited repricing of
deposits relative to the decline in rates.
Analysis.
Measures of net interest income at risk produced by simulation analysis are
indicators of an institution’s short-term
performance in alternative rate environments.
These measures are typically based upon a relatively brief period, and do not
necessarily indicate the long-term prospects or economic value of the institution.

The Net Interest Income (“NII”) at Risk position was less favorable at
December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 for
the 12-month shock for all rate scenarios.
The year-over-year unfavorable comparison
was primarily driven by lack of PPP fees
compared to the prior year.
The model indicates that in the short-term, all rising rate environments will positively impact the
net
interest margin of the Company,
while a declining rate environment of 100 bp will have a negative impact on
the net interest
margin.
All measures of Net Interest Income at Risk are within our prescribed policy limits over
both the 12-month and 24-month periods,
with the exception of rates down 100 bp over 24-months.
We are slightly out of compliance
in this rates down 100 bp scenario as
we have a limited ability to lower our deposit rates the full 100 bp relative to the decline
in market rate.
In addition, this analysis
incorporates an instantaneous, parallel shock and assumes we move
with market rates and do not lag our deposit rates.
The measures of equity value at risk indicate our ongoing economic value
by considering the effects of changes in interest rates
on all of our cash flows by discounting the cash flows to estimate the present
value of assets and liabilities. The difference
between these discounted values of the assets and liabilities is the economic value
of equity, which in theory
approximates the fair
value of our net assets.

Down 200, 300 and 400 bp rate scenarios have been excluded due to the current
interest rate environment.
At December 31, 2021, the economic value of equity was favorable
in all rising rate environments and was within prescribed
tolerance levels. Factors that can impact EVE values year-over-year include the absolute level of rates,
the overall structure of the
balance sheet (including liquidity levels), pre-payment speeds, loan
floors and the change of model assumptions.
Although the change in EVE exceeds policy guidelines in the down
100 bps rate scenario, the EVE Ratio (EVE/EVA)
was 9.6%
for the fourth quarter 2021 and was within policy guidelines. EVE is out of compliance
only if BOTH the EVE and EVE ratio are
outside of policy guidelines.
Therefore, EVE is currently in compliance with policy in all rate scenarios.
As the interest rate environment and the dynamics of the economy continue to change,
additional simulations will be analyzed to
address not only the changing rate environment, but also the changing
statement of financial condition mix, measured over
multiple years, to help assess the risk to the Company.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES
Liquidity
In general terms, liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet our
cash needs.
Our objective in managing our liquidity is to
maintain our ability to fund loan commitments, purchase securities, accommodate
deposit withdrawals or repay other liabilities in
accordance with their terms, without an adverse impact on our current or
future earnings.
Our liquidity strategy is guided by
policies that are formulated and monitored by our ALCO and senior management,
and which take into account the marketability
of assets, the sources and stability of funding and the level of unfunded commitments.
We regularly evaluate
all of our various
funding sources with an emphasis on accessibility,
stability, reliability
and cost-effectiveness.
For 2021 and 2020, our principal
source of funding was client deposits, supplemented by our short-term
and long-term borrowings, primarily from our trust-
preferred securities, securities sold under repurchase agreements, federal
funds purchased and FHLB borrowings.
We believe that
the cash generated from operations, our borrowing capacity and our access to capital
resources are sufficient to meet our future
operating capital and funding requirements.
At December 31, 2021, we had the ability to generate approximately $1.287 billion
in additional liquidity through all of our
available resources beyond our overnight funds sold position.
In addition to the primary borrowing outlets mentioned above, we
also have the ability to generate liquidity by borrowing from the Federal Reserve
Discount Window and through brokered
deposits.
We recognize
the importance of maintaining liquidity and have developed a Contingent Liquidity
Plan, which addresses
various liquidity stress levels and our response and action based on the
level of severity.
We periodically
test our credit facilities
for access to the funds, but also understand that as the severity of the liquidity
level increases certain credit facilities may no
longer be available.
We conduct quarterly liquidity
stress tests and the results are reported to ALCO, MROC, EROC and the
Board of Directors.
We believe the
liquidity available to us is sufficient to meet our ongoing needs.
We also view our
investment portfolio as a liquidity source and have the option to pledge securities in our
portfolio as collateral
for borrowings or deposits, and/or sell selected securities.
Our portfolio consists of debt issued by the U.S. Treasury,
U.S.
governmental agencies, municipal governments, and corporate entities.
The weighted-average maturity of our portfolio was 3.62
years at December 31, 2021 and had a net unrealized pre-tax loss of $6.1 million
in the AFS portfolio.
Our average net overnight funds sold position (defined as funds sold plus interest-bearing
deposits with other banks less funds
purchased) was $790.9 million in 2021 compared to an average net overnight
funds sold position of $465.7 million in 2020.
The
increase in this position in 2021 reflected strong deposit growth, primarily
related to government stimulus program inflows.
We expect capital
expenditures over the next 12 months to be approximately $8.0 million, which
will consist primarily of
technology purchases for banking offices, business applications,
and information technology security needs as well as furniture
and fixtures and banking office remodels.
We expect that these capital expenditures
will be funded with existing resources
without impairing our ability to meet our ongoing obligations.
Borrowings
At December 31, 2021, total advances from the FHLB consisted of
$1.5 million in outstanding debt comprised of five notes.
In
2021, the Bank made FHLB advance payments totaling $0.7 million. One
advance matured, and one was paid off, with no new
fixed rate advances obtained in 2021. The FHLB notes are collateralized by a floating
lien on certain 1-4 family residential
mortgage loans, commercial real estate mortgage loans, and home equity
mortgage loans.
We have issued two
junior subordinated deferrable interest notes to wholly owned Delaware statutory
trusts.
The first note for
$30.9 million was issued to CCBG Capital Trust I in
November 2004.
The second note for $32.0 million was issued to CCBG
Capital Trust II in May 2005.
In the second quarter of 2020, we entered into a derivative cash flow hedge of our
interest rate risk related to our subordinated
debt.
The notional amount of the derivative is $30 million ($10 million of the CCBG Capital Trust
I borrowing and $20 million
of the CCBG Capital Trust II borrowing).
The interest rate swap agreement requires CCBG to pay fixed and receive variable
(Libor plus spread) and has an average
all-in fixed rate of 2.50% for 10 years.
Additional detail on the interest rate swap
agreement is provided in Note 5 - Derivatives in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
For 2021, average short term borrowings consisting primarily of
CCHL lines of credit, declined $15.6 million compared to the
prior year. This decline occurred
as residential lending was less robust than the prior year,
reducing the short-term need for
borrowing lines.
See Note 11 - Short Term
Borrowings and Note 12 - Long Term
Borrowings in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information on borrowings.
In the ordinary course of business, we have entered into contractual obligations
and have made other commitments to make future
payments. Refer to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial
statements elsewhere in this report for the expected timing
of such payments as of December 31, 2021. These include payments related
to (i) long-term borrowings (Note 12 - Long-Term
Borrowings), (ii) short-term borrowings (Note 11
- Short-Term Borrowings),
(iii) operating leases (Note 7 - Leases), (iv) time
deposits with stated maturities (Note 10 - Deposits), and (v) commitments
to extend credit and standby letters of credit (Note 21 -
Commitments and Contingencies).
Capital Resources
Shareowners’ equity was $383.2 million at December 31, 2021
compared to $320.8 million at December 31, 2020.
For 2021,
shareowners’ equity was positively impacted by net income attributable
to common shareowners of $33.4 million, a $34.1 million
decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss for our pension plan,
a $1.1 million increase in fair value of the interest rate
swap related to subordinated debt, net adjustments totaling $1.3 million
related to transactions under our stock compensation
plans, stock compensation accretion of $0.8 million, and reclassification of
$9.3 million from temporary equity to decrease the
redemption value of the non-controlling interest in CCHL.
Shareowners’ equity was reduced by common stock dividends of
$10.5 million ($0.62 per share) and a $7.3 million decrease in the unrealized
gain on investment securities.
Additional historical
information on capital changes is provided in the Consolidated Statements of
Changes in Shareowners’ Equity in the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
We continue
to maintain a strong capital position.
The ratio of shareowners' equity to total assets at December 31, 2021 was
8.99% and 8.45% at December 31, 2020.
Further, our tangible common equity,
was 6.95% at December 31, 2021 compared to
6.25% at December 31, 2020.
The improvement in the ratios in 2021
was substantially due to a favorable adjustment to our
unfunded pension liability,
which is discussed further below.
We are subject to
regulatory risk-based capital requirements that measure capital relative
to risk-weighted assets and off-balance
sheet financial instruments.
At December 31, 2021, our total risk-based capital ratio was 17.15% compared
to 17.30% at
December 31, 2020.
Our common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 13.86% and 13.71%, respectively,
on these dates.
Our leverage
ratio was 8.95% and 9.33%, respectively,
on these dates.
For a detailed discussion of our regulatory capital requirements, refer
to
the “Regulatory Considerations - Capital Regulations” section on page
15.
See Note 17 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information as to our capital adequacy.
At December 31, 2021, our common stock had a book value of $22.63 per diluted
share compared to $19.05 at December 31,
2020.
Book value is impacted by the net unrealized gains and losses on investment
securities.
At December 31, 2021, the net
unrealized loss was $4.6 million compared to an unrealized gain
of $2.7 million at December 31, 2020.
Book value is also
impacted by the recording of our unfunded pension liability through
other comprehensive income in accordance with Accounting
Standards Codification Topic
715.
At December 31, 2021, the net pension liability reflected in accumulated other comprehensive
loss was $13.2 million compared to $47.3 million at December 31, 2020.
The favorable adjustment to our unfunded pension
liability was attributable to the higher discount rate used to calculate the present
value of the pension obligation and higher than
estimated return on plan assets.
The higher discount rate reflected the increase in long-term interest rates in
2021.
This
adjustment also favorably impacted our tangible capital ratio.
Further, book value is impacted by the periodic adjustment
made to
record temporary equity at redemption value.
At December 31, 2021, $9.3
million had been reclassified from temporary equity to
retained earnings during 2021
to decrease the redemption value of the non-controlling interest in CCHL.
In February 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1,500,000
shares of our outstanding common stock
over a five-year period.
Repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions;
however, we are
not obligated to repurchase any specified number of shares.
In January 2019, the 2014 plan was terminated and our Board of
Directors approved a new share repurchase plan that authorizes the repurchase
of up to 750,000 shares of our outstanding
common stock over a five-year period.
Terms of this plan are substantially similar
to the 2014 plan.
No shares were repurchased
in 2021.
99,952 shares were repurchased in 2020 at an average price of $20.39 and 77,000 shares
were repurchased in 2019 at an
average price of $23.40.
Since 2014, a total of 1,361,682 shares of our outstanding common stock have been repurchased
at an
average price of $17.93 under our stock repurchase plans.
Dividends
Adequate capital and financial strength are paramount to our stability
and the stability of our subsidiary bank.
Cash dividends
declared and paid should not place unnecessary strain on our capital levels.
When determining the level of dividends,
the
following factors are considered:
●
Compliance with state and federal laws and regulations;
●
Our capital position and our ability to meet our financial obligations;
●
Projected earnings and asset levels; and
●
The ability of the Bank and us to fund dividends.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We are a party
to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks in the normal
course of business to meet the financing needs
of our clients.
See Note 21 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
If commitments arising from these financial instruments continue to require
funding at historical levels, management does not
anticipate that such funding will adversely impact our ability to meet on-going obligations.
In the event these commitments
require funding in excess of historical levels, management believes current
liquidity, investment security
maturities, available
advances from the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank, and warehouse
lines of credit provide a sufficient source of funds to meet
these commitments.
In conjunction with the sale and securitization of loans held for sale and their related
servicing rights, we may be exposed to
liability resulting from recourse, repurchase and make-whole agreements.
If it is determined subsequent to our sale of a loan or
its related servicing rights that a breach of the representations or warranties
made in the applicable sale agreement has occurred,
which may include guarantees that prepayments will not occur within a specified
and customary time frame, we may have an
obligation to either (a) repurchase the loan for the unpaid principal balance,
accrued interest and related advances, (b) indemnify
the purchaser against any loss it suffers or (c) make the purchaser whole
for the economic benefits of the loan and its related
servicing rights.
Our repurchase, indemnification and make-whole obligations vary based upon
the terms of the applicable agreements, the nature
of the asserted breach and the status of the mortgage loan at the time a claim is made.
We establish reserves for
estimated losses
of this nature inherent in the origination of mortgage loans by estimating the losses inherent
in the population of all loans sold
based on trends in claims and actual loss severities experienced. The reserve
will include accruals for probable contingent losses
in addition to those identified in the pipeline of claims received. The estimation
process is designed to include amounts based on
actual losses experienced from actual activity.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The consolidated financial statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements are prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
which require us to make various estimates and
assumptions (see Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
We believe that,
of our significant accounting
policies, the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and
complexity.
Allowance for Credit Losses
.
The amount of the allowance for credit losses represents management's best estimate
of current
expected credit losses considering available information, from internal
and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to
credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument.
Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience,
current conditions,
and reasonable and supportable forecasts.
While historical credit loss experience provides
the basis for the
estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information
may be made for changes in loan risk grades, loss
experience trends, loan prepayment trends, differences
in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions,
future expectations, or other relevant factors.
While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the
ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon
a variety
of factors beyond our control, including the
performance of our portfolios, the economy,
changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward
classification of assets. Detailed information on the Allowance
for Credit Losses valuation, and the assumptions used are provided
in Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Goodwill
.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair value
of their identifiable net
assets.
We perform
an impairment review on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
indicate
that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Adverse changes in the economic environment, declining operations, or other
factors could result in a decline in the estimated implied fair value of goodwill.
If the estimated implied fair value of goodwill is
less than the carrying amount, a loss would be recognized to reduce the
carrying amount to the estimated implied fair value.
We evaluate goodwill
for impairment on an annual basis and in 2017 adopted Accounting Standards
Update 2017-04, Intangibles
- Goodwill and Other (Topic
350): Simplifying Accounting for Goodwill Impairment which allows for
a qualitative assessment
of goodwill impairment indicators.
If the assessment indicates that impairment has more than likely occurred, the
Company must
compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount.
If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds
its estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded
equal to the excess.
During the fourth quarter, we performed
our annual impairment testing.
We proceeded with qualitative
assessment by evaluating
impairment indicators and concluded there were none that indicated that
goodwill impairment had occurred.
Pension Assumptions
.
We have a defined benefit
pension plan for the benefit of substantially all of our associates.
Our funding
policy with respect to the pension plan is to contribute, at a minimum,
amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements
as set by law.
Pension expense is determined by an external actuarial valuation based
on assumptions that are evaluated annually
as of December 31, the measurement date for the pension obligation.
The service cost component of pension expense is reflected
as “Compensation Expense” in the Consolidated Statements of
Income.
All other components of pension expense are reflected as
“Other Expense”.
The Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition reflect an accrued
pension benefit cost due to funding levels and
unrecognized actuarial amounts.
The most significant assumptions used in calculating the pension
obligation are the weighted-
average discount rate used to determine the present value of the pension obligation,
the weighted-average expected long-term rate
of return on plan assets, and the assumed rate of annual compensation increases.
These assumptions are re-evaluated annually
with the external actuaries, taking into consideration both current market
conditions and anticipated long-term market conditions.
The discount rate is determined by matching the anticipated defined pension
plan cash flows to the spot rates of a corporate Aa-
rated bond index/yield curve and solving for the single equivalent discount
rate which would produce the same present value.
This methodology is applied consistently from year-to-year.
The discount rate utilized in 2021 was 2.88%.
The estimated impact
to 2021 pension expense of a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount
rate would have been an approximate $1.1
million decrease or increase, respectively.
We anticipate using
a 3.11%
discount rate in 2022.
Based on the balances at the December 31, 2021 measurement date, the
estimated impact in accumulated other comprehensive
income of a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate is a decrease
or increase of approximately $4.6 million (after-
tax).
The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined
based on the current and anticipated future
mix of assets in the plan.
The assets currently consist of equity securities, U.S. Government and Government
agency debt
securities, and other securities (typically temporary liquid funds awaiting
investment).
The weighted-average expected long-term
rate of return on plan assets utilized for 2021 was 6.75%.
The estimated impact to 2021 pension expense of a 25 basis point
increase or decrease in the rate of return would have been an approximate $0.4 million
decrease or increase, respectively.
We
anticipate using a rate of return on plan assets of 6.75% for 2022.
The assumed rate of annual compensation increases of 4.00% in 2021 reflected
expected trends in salaries and the employee
base.
We anticipate using
a compensation increase of approximately 4.40% for 2022 reflecting
current market trends.
Detailed information on the pension plan, the actuarially determined
disclosures, and the assumptions used are provided in Note
15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Income Taxes
.
Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change
in deferred tax
assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the
temporary differences between
carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using
enacted tax rates.
A valuation allowance, if needed,
reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the
tax position would be sustained in a tax
examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur.
The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is
greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination.
For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax
benefit is recorded.
We recognize
interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in other expenses.
