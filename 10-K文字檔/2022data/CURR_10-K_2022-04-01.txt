Corporate Overview
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focusing the development and manufacturing of drug formulation and drug delivery technologies in novel dosage forms to improve drug safety, efficacy and patient adherence. Our mission to improve lives by redefining how medications are delivered and experienced. Our business strategy is to develop products using our proprietary technology, license the product rights to partners responsible for clinical development, regulatory approval, marketing and sales and retain exclusive manufacturing rights and market, sell and distribute branded health, wellness, and beauty products through Sera Labs. We operate in a 25,000 square foot cGMP manufacturing plant in Oxnard, CA.
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 15, 2014. The Company was formerly named Makkanotti Group Corp., which was formed to engage in the business of manufacturing food paper bags in Nicosia, Cyprus. On November 7, 2016, the Board of Directors and the majority stockholder of the then outstanding shares of our common stock executed a written consent to change our name from Makkanotti Group Corp. to CURE Pharmaceutical Holding Corp. The Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation was filed with the State of Nevada on November 30, 2016. On September 27, 2019, we reincorporated from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware.
Further, on November 7, 2016, we, in a reverse take-over transaction, acquired a specialty pharmaceutical and bioscience company based in California that specializes in drug delivery technologies, by executing a Share Exchange Agreement and Conversion Agreement (“Exchange Agreement”) by and among us and a holder of a majority of our issued and outstanding capital stock prior to the closing (the “Majority Stockholder”), on the one hand, and CURE Pharmaceutical, all of the shareholders of CURE Pharmaceutical’s issued and outstanding share capital (the “CURE Pharm Shareholders”) and the holders of certain convertible promissory notes of CURE Pharmaceutical (“CURE Pharm Noteholders”), on the other hand. Hereinafter, this share exchange transaction is described as the “Share Exchange.”
As a result of the Share Exchange, CURE Pharmaceutical became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and the CURE Pharm Shareholders and CURE Pharm Noteholders became our controlling shareholders owning, at such time, approximately 65% of our issued and outstanding common stock. For accounting purposes, CURE Pharmaceutical was the surviving entity. As a result of the recapitalization and change in control, CURE Pharmaceutical was deemed to be the accounting acquirer in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations.
On May 14, 2019, the Company, and Merger Sub, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement with CHI, a Delaware corporation. As agreed in the Merger Agreement and pursuant to the Merger, CHI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the stockholders of CHI received shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of CHI.
On October 2, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of Sera Labs, a Delaware corporation pursuant to the Sera Labs Merger Agreement, by and among the Company, Sera Labs Merger Sub, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, Sera Labs and Mrs. Nancy Duitch, in her capacity as the security holder’s representative regarding the Sera Labs Merger.
Nature of Business
We are a biopharmaceutical company focusing on the development and manufacturing of drug formulation and drug delivery technologies in novel dosage forms to improve drug safety, efficacy and patient adherence. Our mission is to improve lives by redefining how medications are delivered and experienced. Our primary business model is to develop wellness and drug products using our proprietary technology, which development may include preclinical and clinical studies and regulatory approval, and grant product rights to partners responsible for marketing, sales and distribution, while retaining exclusive manufacturing rights and to market, sell and distribute branded health, wellness, and beauty products through Sera Labs.
Our technology platform includes oral dissolving film (“OTF”), and encapsulation systems (“microCURE”) compatible with OTF, chews, oral solutions, topical and transdermal dose forms. We apply our technology to pharmaceutical drugs and dietary supplements for the wellness market. OTF products are about the size of a postage stamp and composed of excipients such as polymers, stabilizers, lipids and surfactants, which are all generally recognized as safe. They can be designed to deliver active ingredients to the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract when placed on the tongue and swallowed, or directly to the blood stream when placed under the tongue (sublingual) or on the inner lining of the cheek and lip (buccal).
We sell multiple commercial wellness products under our distribution partners’ brands. We are developing a 50,000IU, once per week, Vitamin D3 OTF for oral administration to be distributed by Meroven Pharmaceuticals in the United States and the MENA region. Our pharmaceutical drug program includes:
CUREfilm Blue
A 25mg and 50 mg sildenafil OTF for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. We have completed our pre-IND meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), confirming a 505(b)(2) regulatory path.
CUREfilm Canna
We are developing several cannabinoid products with optimized pharmacokinetic profiles using microCURE and CUREfilm technology.
CUREfilm Anti-Viral We are developing an orally bio-available anti-viral of an existing therapeutic leveraging existing pre-clinical/clinical safety and toxicity data.
CUREfilm Central Nervous System (CNS)
In the area of CNS indications, we are developing a novel dosage form of a difficult to treat disease states utilizing our proprietary CUREfilm dosage form. These could include but are not limited to mental health disorders such as depression, PTSD, addiction disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, and anxiety.
Impact of COVID-19
Our financial results and operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 were not significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The measures we have taken to ensure the availability and functioning of our critical infrastructure, and to promote the safety and security of our employees remain in place. In accordance with public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, we have imposed travel restrictions, adopted policies aimed at promoting social distancing, and implemented work-from-home arrangements for employees where practicable. These measures and our compliance with local and national guidelines aimed at containing the virus could impact our operations and disrupt our business. Currently, our single operating facility is operational, and no reduction in our work force has taken place.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2021 to the Year Ended December 31, 2020
Revenue
Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $6.6 million as compared to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in revenue included approximately $5.0 million of revenue attributed to the Sera Labs acquisition on October 2, 2020 as we were able to recognize a full year’s worth of revenue in fiscal year ending 2021 compared to the fiscal year ending 2020. However, this increase was offset by a decrease in CURE Pharmaceutical product sales mainly due to the decrease in one of our larger customers of approximately $0.3 million.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold was $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $1.1 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cost of goods sold increased by $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, which was due to (i) the acquisition of Sera Labs on October 2, 2020, which added additional $1.7 million of cost of goods sold and (ii) decrease in revenues from CURE Pharmaceutical which was mainly due to the decrease in one of our larger customers.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses were $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Research and development expenses decreased by $0.4 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in research and development expenses is mainly due to the Company not incurring the same third-party contractor expenses for our CUREfilm Blue product during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we engaged a third-party contractor to assist in the development in our CUREfilm Blue that will take us into our pre-clinical trials, which all services ended in 2020. However, the decrease in spend with this third-party contractor was offset with continuing the development various other OTF and other delivery forms during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Our expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 are summarized as follows in comparison to our expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Consulting
Consulting expenses decreased by approximately $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was due to the Company decreasing the number of consultants used during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. In addition, a majority of the expenses related to noncash consulting services where the Company issued common stock shares in exchange for services performed over a period of time. The Company did not issue as many common stock shares in exchange for services during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Salaries and wages
Salaries and wages expense increased by approximately $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the Company adding approximately $1.5 million of salaries and wages from the acquisition of Sera Labs on October 2, 2020, which was a full year’s worth of salaries and wages during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to only approximately 3 months of salaries and wages during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense increased by approximately $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This was mainly due to the Company recognizing a full year’s worth of SG&A expenses from Sera Labs during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to only 3 months of SG&A expenses from Sera Labs during the year ended December 31, 2020. The main factors for the increase in SG&A expenses incurred by Sera Labs during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 are (i) marketing and advertising expenses increased by approximately $3.1 million, (ii) increase in amortization expenses of $2.3 million and (iii) increase in brand ambassador expenses of approximately $1.0 million.
Professional and Investor Relations
Professional and investor relations expenses decreased by approximately $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was a result of the Company incurring less legal expenses during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The decrease in legal expenses was due the following factors occurring during the year ended December 31, 2020 and not during the year ended December 31, 2021: (i) incurring legal costs for the Sera Labs acquisition and (ii) the CHI settlement for their earnout shares.
Non-cash Compensation
Non-cash compensation expense increased by approximately $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is mainly due to the Company recording the fair value of vested stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units issued from our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan during the year ended December 31, 2021. The fair values of the vested stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units during the year ended 2022 were more compared to the fair values of the vested stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units in the same period in 2020.
Change in Fair Value Contingent Stock Consideration
Change in fair value stock consideration decreased by approximately $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same time period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the settlement with CHI on June 5, 2020, which resulted in a significant decrease in the change in fair value of contingent stock consideration during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2021, the fair value of the contingent shares to be issued to Sera Labs also decreased mainly due to the decrease in the stock price during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Other Expense
Other income/(expense) for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased approximately $13.6 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is due to (i) recording the change in fair value of the Series A and Series B Notes at issuance during the year ended December 31, 2021, on the date of the partial conversion of the Series A Note and on December 31, 2020, and (ii) recording the debt discounts, transaction costs and fair value of placement agent warrants issued in connection to the Series A and Series B Notes as interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2020, (iii) a gain on extinguishment of the PPP loan that was forgiven during the year ended December 31, 2021, (iv) reserve on investment relating to Releaf Europe b.v. of approximately $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 and (v) a gain on settlement of approximately $2.4 million relating to the settlement reached between the Company and Canopy during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Liquidity & Capital Resources

Cash Flows and liquidity
Net cash used in Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $4.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. This was primarily due to the net loss of approximately $12.8 million, including changes from (i) gain from extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.7, (ii) stock based compensation of approximately $0.8 million, (iii) change in fair value of convertible promissory notes of approximately $0.4 million, (iv) the fair value of vested stock options, restricted stocks and restricted stock units of approximately $3.1 million, (v) change in fair value of contingent share consideration of approximately $1.8 million, (vi) reserve on investment of approximately $0.4 million, (vii) depreciation and amortization of approximately $3.6 million, (viii) a decrease in prepaid expenses of approximately $0.9 million, (ix) an increase in accounts payable of approximately $0.7 million, (x) an increase in accrued expenses of approximately $2.8 million and (xi) an decrease in contract liabilities of approximately $0.5 million.
Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $9.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. This was primarily due to the net loss of approximately $30.6 million, partially offset by (i) the amortization of the debt discount of approximately $1.5 million, (ii) stock based compensation of approximately $0.6 million, (iii) change in fair value of convertible promissory notes of approximately $9.4 million, (iv) the fair value of vested stock options, restricted stocks and restricted stock units of approximately $2.8 million, (v) change in fair value of contingent share consideration of approximately $5.8 million, (vi) an increase in prepaid expenses of approximately $0.3 million, (vii) an increase in accounts payable of approximately $0.5 million, (viii) an increase in accrued expenses of approximately $0.5 million and (ix) an decrease in contract liabilities of approximately $1.4 million.
Net cash used in Investing Activities
Net cash used from investing activities of approximately of $0.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 was due to (i) collection of note receivable of approximately $0.2 million, which was offset by (i) the purchase of property and equipment for approximately $0.04 million; (ii) purchase of note receivable of approximately $0.2 million, (iii) purchase of intangible assets of $0.1 million and (iv) investment of $0.1 million.
Net cash used from investing activities of approximately of $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to (i) cash acquired from the acquisition of Sera Labs of approximately of $1.4 million and (ii) collection of note receivable of approximately $1.0 million, which was offset by (i) the purchase of property and equipment for approximately $0.7 million; (ii) purchase of note receivable of approximately $1.5 million and (iii) investment of $0.3 million.
Net cash provided by Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities of approximately $2.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to (i) approximately $3.1 million in proceeds from issuance of notes, related party payable and loans payable and (ii) approximately $0.3 million for repayment of loans payables.
Net cash provided by financing activities of approximately $7.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to (i) approximately $5.0 million received from the issuances of new convertible notes payable, (ii) approximately $2.6 million in proceeds from issuance of notes and loans payable, (iii) approximately $1.4 million from exercise of warrants, and (iv) approximately $1.5 million for repayment of loan and note payables.
We may need to raise additional operating capital in calendar year 2022 in order to maintain our operations and to realize our business plan. Without additional sources of cash and/or the deferral, reduction, or elimination of significant planned expenditures, we may not have the cash resources to continue as a going concern thereafter.
Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $94.4 million and a working capital deficit of approximately $22.5 million. Our operating activities consume the majority of our cash resources. We anticipate that we will continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows from operations, at least into the near future, as we execute our commercialization and development plans and strategic and business development initiatives.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the auditors’ opinion contained a going concern paragraph, which stated that the Company had an accumulated deficit, working deficit and net loss. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of the financial statements.
We have an accumulated deficit balance as of December 31, 2021. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until we establish a sufficient revenue stream to consistently generate operating profits. We are continually analyzing our current costs and are attempting to make additional cost reductions where possible. We expect that we will continue to generate losses from operations throughout 2022.
Historically, we have had operating losses and negative cash flows from operations which cast significant doubt upon our ability to continue as a going concern. As such, we have needed to raise capital in order to fund its operations. This need may be adversely impacted by uncertain market conditions and changes in the regulatory environment. We have previously funded, and intend to continue funding, our losses primarily through the issuance of common stock and/or promissory notes, combined with or without warrants, and cash generated from our product sales and research and development and license agreements. We are currently discussing various financing alternatives with potential investors, but there can be no assurance that these funds will be available on terms acceptable to us or will be enough to fully sustain operations. We believe the funds available through these potential financings will be sufficient to meet the Company’s working capital requirements during the coming year. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional funds. We will have to develop and implement a plan to extend payables, reduce expenditures, or scale back our business plan until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations.
Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.
Future Financing
We will require additional funds to implement the growth strategy for our business. As mentioned above, we intend to continue funding our losses primarily through the issuance of common stock and/or promissory notes, combined with or without warrants, and cash generated from our product sales and research and development and license agreements. We are currently discussing various financing alternatives with potential investors, but there can be no assurance that these funds will be available on terms acceptable to us or will be enough to fully sustain operations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
As a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12(b) of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information required by this item.
Impact of Inflation
The impact of inflation upon our revenue and loss from operations during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 has not been material to our financial position or results of operations for those years.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. We have identified below our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe require the greatest amount of judgment. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates which are subject to significant judgment, including those related to the going concern assessments of our consolidated financial statements, allocation of direct and indirect expenses, useful lives associated with long-lived intangible assets, machinery and equipment, loss contingencies, valuation allowances related to deferred income taxes, and assumptions used to value stock-based awards, debt or other equity instruments. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates compared to historical experience and trends, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities. To the extent that there are material differences between our estimates and our actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected.
We believe the assumptions and estimates associated with the following have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Going concern assessment
With the implementation of FASB’s standard on going concern, ASU No. 2014-15, we assess going concern uncertainty in our consolidated financial statements to determine if we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents on hand and working capital, including available loans or lines of credit, if any, to operate for a period of at least one year from the date our consolidated financial statements are issued, which is referred to as the “look-forward period” as defined by ASU No. 2014-15. As part of this assessment, based on conditions that are known and reasonably knowable to us, we consider various scenarios, forecasts, projections, and estimates, and we make certain key assumptions, including the timing and nature of projected cash expenditures or programs, and our ability to delay or curtail those expenditures or programs, if necessary, among other factors. Based on this assessment, as necessary or applicable, we make certain assumptions around implementing curtailments or delays in the nature and timing of programs and expenditures to the extent we deem probable those implementations can be achieved and we have the proper authority to execute them within the look-forward period in accordance with ASU No. 2014-15.
Business combinations
We account for business combinations, such as the CHI Merger and the Sera Labs Merger, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805, Business Combinations, which requires the purchase price to be measured at fair value. When the purchase consideration consists, in part or entirely of our common shares, we calculate the purchase price by determining the fair value, as of the acquisition date, of shares issued in connection with the closing of the acquisition. We recognize estimated fair values of the tangible assets and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development (“IPR&D”), and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, and we record as goodwill any amount of the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in excess of the purchase price.
Contingent consideration liabilities
ASC 805 requires that contingent consideration be estimated and recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date as part of the total consideration transferred. Contingent consideration is an obligation of the acquirer to transfer additional assets or equity interests to the selling shareholders in the future if certain future events occur or conditions are met, such as the attainment of product development milestones. Contingent consideration also includes additional future payments to selling shareholders based on achievement of components of earnings, such as “earn-out” provisions or percentage of future revenues, including royalties paid to the selling shareholders based on a percentage of revenues generated from CHI and Sera Labs over the contractual period.
The fair value of milestone-based contingent consideration was determined using a scenario analysis valuation method which incorporates our assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achievement of revenue and gross margin percentage milestones, as defined in the Sera Labs Merger Agreement, credit risk, timing of the contingent consideration payments and a risk-adjusted discount rate to estimate the present value of the expected payments, all of which require significant management judgment and assumptions. Since the contingent consideration payments are based on nonfinancial, binary events, management believes the use of the scenario analysis method is appropriate.
The fair value of all contingent consideration after the Sera Labs Merger Date is reassessed by us as changes in circumstances and conditions occur, with the subsequent change in fair value recorded in our consolidated statements of operations. Changes in key assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and, accordingly, the resulting gain or loss that we record in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report.
Goodwill and intangible assets
In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, in-process research and development projects acquired in a business combination that are not complete as of the acquisition date are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until completion or abandonment of the related research and development efforts. Upon successful completion of the project, the capitalized amount is amortized over its estimated useful life. If a project is abandoned, all remaining capitalized amounts are written off immediately. We consider various factors and risks for potential impairment of IPR&D assets, including the current legal and regulatory environment, uncertainties posed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the competitive landscape. Adverse clinical trial results, significant delays or inability to scale up, the inability to bring a product or service to market and the introduction or advancement of competitors’ product or services could result in partial or full impairment of the related intangible assets. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the IPR&D project may vary from its fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPR&D impairment charges may occur in future periods. During the period between completion or abandonment, the IPR&D assets will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if we become aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of the IPR&D projects below their respective carrying amounts.
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets and liabilities. Goodwill, similar to IPR&D, is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually, or if circumstances indicate its value may no longer be recoverable. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting our business. Based on the qualitative assessment, if it is determined that the fair value of goodwill is more likely than not to be less than its carrying amount, the fair value of a reporting unit will be calculated and compared with its carrying amount and an impairment charge will be recognized for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value. Since October 2020, we operate in two segments, (Cure Pharma Products/Services and The Sera Labs) and considered to be the two reporting units and, therefore, goodwill is tested for impairment at the segment/reporting unit level.
Accounting for warrants
We determine the accounting classification of warrants we issue, as either liability or equity classified, by first assessing whether the warrants meet liability classification in accordance with ASC 480-10, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, then in accordance with ASC 815-40, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock. Under ASC 480, warrants are considered liability classified if the warrants are mandatorily redeemable, obligate us to settle the warrants or the underlying shares by paying cash or other assets, and warrants that must or may require settlement by issuing variable number of shares. If warrants do not meet the liability classification under ASC 480-10, we assess the requirements under ASC 815-40, which states that contracts that require or may require the issuer to settle the contract for cash are liabilities recorded at fair value, irrespective of the likelihood of the transaction occurring that triggers the net cash settlement feature. If the warrants do not require liability classification under ASC 815-40, in order to conclude equity classification, we also assess whether the warrants are indexed to our common stock and whether the warrants are classified as equity under ASC 815-40 or other GAAP. After all such assessments, we conclude whether the warrants are classified as liability or equity. Liability classified warrants require fair value accounting at issuance and subsequent to initial issuance with all changes in fair value after the issuance date recorded in the statements of operations. Equity classified warrants only require fair value accounting at issuance with no changes recognized subsequent to the issuance date. We do not have any liability classified warrants as of any period presented. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report.
Fair Value Option for Convertible Notes
We have elected the fair value option to account for the Series A and B Notes that were issued on October 30, 2020 and record these at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As a result of applying the fair value option, direct costs and fees related to the Series A and B Notes are recognized in earnings as incurred and not deferred. Values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs reflect management’s and, if applicable, an independent third-party valuation firm’s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. We believe accounting for the Series A and B Notes at fair value better aligns the measurement methodologies of assets and liabilities, which may mitigate certain earnings volatility.
When the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. For example, a Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are observable (Levels 1 and 2) and unobservable (Level 3).
Stock-based compensation
We recognize compensation expense related to share-based payments in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for share-based payment awards made to directors and employees based on estimated fair values. We estimate the fair value of employee stock-based payment awards on the grant-date and recognize the resulting fair value over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis. For stock-based awards that vest only upon the attainment of one or more performance goals, compensation cost is recognized if and when we determine that it is probable that the performance condition or conditions will be, or have been, achieved. We utilize the Black-Scholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of stock options. Our determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we estimated the expected volatility using our own stock price volatility to the extent applicable or a combination of our stock price volatility and the stock price volatility of stock of peer companies, for a period equal to the expected term of the options. The expected term of options granted is based on our own experience and, in part, based upon the “simplified method” provided under Staff Accounting Bulletin, Topic 14, or SAB Topic 14, as necessary. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rates in effect during the corresponding period of grant. Although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with FASB guidance, the key inputs and assumptions may change as we develop our own company estimates, experience and key inputs including our expected term, and stock price volatility based on the trading history of our stock in the public market. Changes in these subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value of equity grants and the stock-based compensation that we record in our consolidated financial statements.
Leases
We account for leases in accordance with ASC 842, Leases. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leases are classified as either financing or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the consolidated statements of operations. Under the available practical expedients for the adoption of ASC 842, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We recognize right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities for leases with terms greater than twelve months in the consolidated balance sheet. ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset during the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We use the implicit rate when it is readily determinable. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Operating leases are included as operating right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities, current and long-term, in the consolidated balance sheets. Financing leases are included as finance right-of-use assets and in financing lease liabilities, current and long-term, in the consolidated balance sheets. We disclose the amortization of our ROU assets and operating lease payments as a net amount, “Amortization of right-of-use assets”, on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
On January 1, 2019, the adoption date of ASC 842, and based on the available practical expedients under the standard, we did not reassess any expired or existing contracts, reassess the lease classification for any expired or existing leases and reassess initial direct costs for exiting leases. We also elected not to capitalize leases that have terms of twelve months or less.
The adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements because we did not have any significant operating leases at the time of adoption. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we entered into various operating leases and an embedded operating lease in accordance with ASC 842 discussed in Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. Our accounting for financing leases (previously referred to as “capital leases”) remained substantially unchanged.
Impairment of long-lived assets
We assess the impairment of long-lived assets, which consists primarily of long-lived intangible assets, machinery and equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired and the carrying value may not be recoverable. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and the expected undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value is recorded.
Income taxes
We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, which prescribes the use of the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our judgments regarding future taxable income may change over time due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws, tax planning strategies or other factors. If our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future, the valuation allowance may be increased or decreased, which may have a material impact on our statements of operations.
The guidance also prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not sustainable upon examination by taxing authorities. We will recognize accrued interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. No amounts were accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of the financial statement periods presented herein. We account for uncertain tax positions by assessing all material positions taken in any assessment or challenge by relevant taxing authorities. We are currently unaware of any tax issues under review. See Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report.
Revenue recognition
We followed the revenue recognition standard ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC) 606. Pursuant to ASC 606, revenues are recognized when control of services performed is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services. ASC 606 provides for a five-step model that includes, (i) identifying the contract with a customer, (ii) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determining the transaction price, (iv) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v) recognizing revenue when, or as, an entity satisfies a performance obligation.
Product revenue
In the fourth quarter of 2020, we acquired The Sera Labs products. In determining whether all of the revenue recognition criteria (i) through (v) above are met with respect to CBD and Personal Protection Equipment product order is considered a single performance obligation and is generally considered complete when the product result is delivered or made available to the customer and, as such, there are shipping and/or handling fees incurred by us or billed to customers. Although we bill a list price for all products ordered and completed for all payer types, we recognize realized revenue when all the revenue recognition criteria have been met. These contracts do not have variable price considerations. For all payers, we must take into account the uncertainty of receiving payment, or being subject to claims for refund, from payers with whom we do not have a sufficient payment collection history or contractual reimbursement agreements. Historically, we have de minims claims for returns.
Pharma Products and Services revenue
Cure Pharmaceutical’s formulation and product development income includes services for the development of OTF products utilizing our CureFilm Technology. Our development contracts have up to four phases. Revenue is recognized based on progress toward completion of the performance obligation in each phase. The method to measure progress toward completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We generally use the input method to measure progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of assets to the customer, which occurs as we incur costs for the contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the progress toward completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Costs to fulfill these obligations mainly include materials, labor, supplies and consultants. We generally identify each sale of our pharma service offering as a single performance obligation.
We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the evaluation of the collectability of accounts receivables after considering a variety of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due, significant events that may impair the customer’s ability to pay, such as a bankruptcy filing or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position, and historical experience. If circumstances related to customers change, estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted. We continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses and uncollectible accounts, if any, based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts. As of December 31, 2021, we have $0.08 million recorded allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivables.
