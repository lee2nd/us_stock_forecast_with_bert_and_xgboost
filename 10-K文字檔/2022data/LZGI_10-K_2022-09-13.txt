Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Executive Overview
LZG International, Inc. was a “blank check” company until acquired by the current management team on October 23, 2021 (“AI Recap”). Incorporated in the State of Florida on May 22, 2000, as LazyGrocer.Com, Inc., the company offered an online grocery solution, limited its operations in November 2001 and changed its name to LZG International, Inc., on August 28, 2009.
As part of the AI Recap, we capitalized the company with software and related IT Assets, including the Outcomes™ engine and the connected AI Solutions, that use artificial intelligence (“AI”) to help businesses automate and optimize enterprise decision cycles (“AI Solutions”).
Since 2015, our Outcomes™ engine and platform have enabled scores of innovations across dozens of business cases, billions of transactions, and hundreds of millions of behavioral profiles.
In 2019, for example, our AI solution for Bank of America outperformed by over 60% the combined effectiveness and efficiency of BOA’s $100M state of the art system and 800 of its investigative experts to fight financial crimes.
In November 2021, we launched a foreign exchange (“FX”) AI solution to tackle discriminatory pricing, especially with the start-up, small and mid-sized enterprises (“SMEs”) in the $6.6 trillion-dollar daily FX market. The solution uses our Peer Intelligence technology to auto-match individual client’s purchase cycles with their currency and supply chain risk to optimize FX and minimize constraints, across thousands of peers, in hundreds of sectors.
On February 23, 2022, we acquired the software assets of Intellagents, LLC., to accelerate our insurance focus.
After the close of the period covered by this report, the Company acquired the capital stock of Prime Source and certain affiliates (“Prime Source”), as described in the current report on Form 8-K filed on June 24, 2022. The business of Prime Source is owned by a subsidiary of the company, and is being integrated into the world-wide business of the Company.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of May 31, 2022, we had cash of $81,567 and total liabilities of $3,149,738 compared to cash of $4,735 and total liabilities of $294,610 on May 31, 2021. Receivables from trade activity and related party receivables total $9,949,625 compared to $0.00 on May 31, 2021. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, we have begun to generate ongoing revenues, but they are not yet sufficient to cover our operating costs. During the year ended May 31, 2022, we primarily relied upon stock and stock subscription sales to fund our operations. During the year ended May 31, 2021, we relied upon advances and notes payable from related parties to fund our operations. The current conditions continue to raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are currently devoting our efforts to obtaining capital from stockholders and are seeking to acquire additional companies with established revenue sources. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to find additional investors and the ability to acquire additional businesses with established revenues.
During the next 12 months we anticipate incurring costs related to investigating, analyzing and acquiring businesses. Our current operating costs will also increase as we continue to develop our newly acquired intellectual assets. We believe we will be able to meet our anticipated operating needs through funds provided by additional stockholders.
Results of Operations
We recorded $216,166 of Revenue in 2022. Our gross operating profit was $173,651 in 2022. There was no sales activity in 2021. General and administrative expenses were $1,068,919 and $13,800 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Interest Expense was $18,795 in 2022 and $16,042 in 2021.
Our net loss increased for 2022 ($919,793) compared to 2021 ($29,842).
Obligations
In 2022, existing debt was converted to subordinated notes which were later converted to common stock.
On May 31, 2018, a stockholder converted $92,500 of its accounts payable to a promissory note which bears interest at 8% per annum and is due on demand. On May 31, 2021, the stockholder converted $6,000 of its accounts payable to a promissory note which bears interest at 8% per annum and is due on demand, resulting in a total principal balance due of $119,200. Interest expense was $3,978 and $9,056 for the years ended May 31, 2022 and 2021. On October 23, 2021, the loan was converted to a convertible promissory note with outstanding interest and principal due of $147,923. On May 11, 2022, the note was converted to 900,000 shares of common stock of the Company.
On May 31, 2021, the Company owed a third party $69,800. The loan incurred interest at 8% per annum and was due on demand. On October 23, 2021, the loan was converted to a convertible promissory note with outstanding principal and interest due of $107,245. On May 11, 2022, the note was converted to 8,907,754 shares of common stock of the Company. Interest expense was $7,197 and $5,107 for 2022 and 2021, respectively.
During the years ended May 31, 2009 and 2010, an officer of the Company loaned an aggregate of $23,500 to the Company. On April 20, 2010, these loans were combined into one promissory note which carries interest at 8% and is not collateralized. The original promissory note had a due date of June 30, 2012; however, the officer agreed to extend the due date of the principal and interest on this note to June 30, 2022. Interest expense was $784 and $1,880 for the years ended May 31, 2022 and 2021. On October 23, 2021, the loan was converted to a convertible promissory note with outstanding principal and interest due of $45,501. On May 11, 2022, the note was cancelled.
On May 11, 2022, the Company assumed a promissory note from a related party in connection with an asset acquisition. The $3,000,000 note bears interest at 8% per annum and is payable on Demand, no later than January 5, 2023. There is no interest expense nor any accrued interest at May 31, 2022.
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
The Company has evaluated Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 regarding the impact of the decreased tax rates of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act. See “Note 7 - Income Taxes” in the notes to our financial statements for schedules that describe the new rates adjusted in the period enacted.
Emerging Growth Company
We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
