ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION
Plan of Operation
The Company’s cash balance is insufficient to satisfy the Company’s cash requirements for the next 12 months. Due to issues surrounding prior litigation, the ability to deliver products to customers has been delayed.
Our notes to the financial statements disclose that the cash flow of the Company has been absorbed in operating activities, has incurred net losses for the fiscal year and has a working capital deficiency. Due to the prior litigation and the current restructuring, the Company operations are not likely to produce positive cash flow until at least the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our going concern uncertainty may affect our ability to raise additional capital, and may also affect our relationships with suppliers and customers. Investors should carefully examine our financial statements and read the notes to the financial statements.

Critical Accounting Policies
The discussions and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations, including the discussion on liquidity and capital resources, are based upon the financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management re-evaluates its estimates and judgments, particularly those related to the determination of the impairment of its intangible assets. Actual results could differ from the estimates. We believe the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
Revenue -
The Company had no sales activity during the current fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. The Company records sales of its products based upon the terms of the contract; when title passes to its customers; and, when collectability is reasonably assured.
Income Taxes -
The amount of income taxes recorded by us requires the interpretation of complex rules and regulations of various taxing jurisdictions throughout the world. We have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for all significant temporary differences, operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We routinely assess the potential realization of our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We routinely assess potential tax contingencies and, if required, establish accruals for such contingencies. The accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are subject to a significant amount of judgment by us and we review and adjust routinely our estimates based on changes in facts and circumstances. Although we believe our tax accruals are adequate, material changes in these accruals may occur in the future, based on the progress of ongoing tax audits, changes in legislation and resolution of pending tax matters.
Litigation -
An estimated loss from a loss contingency is recorded when information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies such as legal matters requires the use of judgment as to the probability of the outcome and the amount. Many legal contingencies can take years to be resolved. An adverse outcome could have a material impact on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
Going Concern Qualification
Due to the prior litigation, the Company has a significant risk of not being able to continue as a going concern. Investors should carefully examine our financial statements.
