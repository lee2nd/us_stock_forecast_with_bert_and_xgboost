Introduction
The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “plan,” “intend,” “estimate,” “project,” “will,” “could,” “may” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect our Company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance and involve risks and uncertainties. Should one or more risks or uncertainties occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially and adversely from those anticipated, believed, expected, planned, intended, estimated, projected, or otherwise indicated. Readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
The following discussion is qualified by reference to and should be read in conjunction with our Company’s financial statements and the notes thereto.
Plan of Operation
The Company is seeking to establish, develop and operate MLFB as a professional spring/summer football league. We intend to establish franchises in cities overlooked by existing professional sports leagues and provide fans with professional football in the NFL off-seasons, which will enable us to take a totally non-adversarial approach towards the NFL. We have commenced the process of leasing playing venues and acquiring football equipment. We have obtained required workers compensation insurance for certain states where we will play games. Our spring and early summer schedule ensures no direct competition with autumn/winter football, including the 32 NFL, 9 Canadian Football League, 627 NCAA, 91 NAIA, 142 JUCO’s, 27 Canadian Universities, and thousands of high school and collegiate institution teams.
The AAF, whose equipment we acquired, has ceased operations and the XFL, which played five games in 2020 before filing for bankruptcy re-organization, has announced plans to restart in 2023. The Spring League is not considered a football league, but rather a football development structure, as the players pay its ownership to play in it, hoping for NFL or other teams’ recognition. We believe because the Spring League has no player payroll costs, quality players will jump at a chance to be paid a salary in MLFB. The USFL returned in 2022 after a 37-year hiatus with an eight-team two division league structure. The top two teams from each division played in the semifinals on the weekend of June 25, with the USFL Championship Game taking place on Sunday, July 3.
MLFB has recently hired several well-known and experienced employees, coaches, scouts, and trainers as well as individuals looking to improve their skills in these areas. We believe this will provide MLFB with the recognition and credibility to demonstrate the viability of our economic model as well as the market’s desire for spring/summer football. The Company recently announced the cities of Mobile, Alabama, Little Rock, Arkansas, Canton, Ohio and Virginia Beach, Virginia as home markets for its inaugural season which will begin August 9, 2022. Additionally, the Company has executed leases with these cities. The Company plans to have several games this summer that allow the Company to build towards a full football season in the spring of 2023, providing MLFB as America’s home for professional spring football.
The AAF, XFL and USFL have proven the concept of fan interest for spring/summer football. We believe that the AAF and XFL lack of financial success was in their financial model, expense structure, venue selection and rents. The XFL, which played five games in 2020 before filing for bankruptcy re-organization, has announced plans to restart in 2023. We believe that there are thousands of quality football players available to MLFB and the NFL releases over 1,000 players every September. We believe that the lack of financial success by the AAF and perhaps the XFL is directly attributable to excessive payroll, stadium, and other overhead related expenses and not the concept itself. MLFB will serve as a pipeline to further develop players skills, on and off the field, as well as a training ground for young coaches, officials and all associated with the industry. NFL Europe did just this during its existence.
MLFB will serve as a pipeline to develop players on and off the field, coaches, officials, scouts, trainers, and all other areas of the game that the NFL needs today. We will also give NFL representatives the opportunity to view our team practices, game footage, practice tapes and confer with league coaches, team officials and staff. We believe this will provide our league with recognition and demonstrate our economic model and the market’s desire for spring football.
We require short-term financing as well as financing over the next 12 months and we have been pursuing, and will continue to pursue, short-term financing, with the intention of securing larger, more permanent financing facilities. Effective February 8, 2022, the Company’s Form 1-A Regulation A Offering Statement was qualified by the SEC for the sale of up to 125,000,000 shares of our $0.001 par value common stock at $0.021 per share or up to $2,625,000 of gross proceeds. There is no minimum number of shares of common stock that must be sold in the offering and the net proceeds from this offering are being utilized to assist in funding our planned summer 2022 football season including equipment purchases and stadium deposits, general and administrative expenses and provide working capital for the Company. Effective July 18, 2022, the Company reduced the offering price for a portion of the shares offered going forward from $0.021 per share to $0.0168 per share.
Through the date of this Form 10-K, the Company had received $1,747,300 of gross proceeds from the sale of 86,180,949 shares of our $0.001 par value common stock. Included in the above amount are $40,000 of gross proceeds from the sale of 1,904,761 shares of our common stock that have not been processed by the transfer agent due to technical document issues.
Additionally, Effective May 6, 2022, the Company signed an Equity Line Purchase Agreement (“Agreement”) whereby subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company will sell to the Investor up to Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) or Four Hundred Million (400,000,000) shares of registered common stock, $0.001 par value per share.
Subject to the satisfaction of all of the conditions set forth in the Agreement, the Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to direct the Investor, by its delivery to the Investor of a Purchase Notice from time to time, to purchase a minimum of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) and up to a maximum of; (i) two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000), or (ii) one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of the average daily volume traded for the Company’s common stock during the relevant Valuation Period (subject to adjustments for stock splits, dividends, and similar occurrences), subject to the Available Amount. The Valuation Period is the ten (10) consecutive Business Days immediately preceding, but not including the date a Purchase Notice is delivered. The maturity date of the Agreement is November 6, 2022.
The Purchase Price is 75% of the lowest traded price of the Common Stock during the Valuation Period. Following an up-list of the Common Stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market or an equivalent national exchange, the Purchase Price shall be set at eighty percent (80%) of the lowest traded price of the Company’s Common Stock during the Valuation Period, subject to a floor of $0.01, per share (subject to adjustments for stock splits, dividends, and similar occurrences). The right of the Company to commence sales of the common stock is subject to the satisfaction that a Registration Statement shall have been declared and remain effective by and with the SEC, and no stop order with respect to the Registration Statement shall be pending or threatened by the SEC.
Through the date of this Form 10-K, the Registration Statement had not been declared effective and as such, no sales of stock have occurred. The Company is in the process of increasing its authorized shares with the State of Delaware to reflect the shares to be sold under the Equity Line Purchase Agreement.
Financial Condition
As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had a net loss of $1,669,699 and $185,381 for the years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additionally, the Company had net cash used in operating activities of $780,693 and $213,518 for the years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At April 30, 2022, the Company has a working capital deficit of $4,186,155, an accumulated deficit of $30,662,481 and a stockholders’ deficit of $3,658,915, which could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operations.
At April 30, 2022, the Company does not have sufficient cash resources or current assets to pay all of its obligations. This is a significant risk to our business and stockholders and results in: (i) making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations; (ii) impeding us from obtaining additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes; and (iii) making us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business and limits our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business.
The time required for us to become profitable under our MLFB business structure is highly uncertain, and we cannot assure you that we will achieve or sustain profitability or generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our planned capital expenditures, working capital and debt service requirements. If required, our ability to obtain additional financing from other sources also depends on many factors beyond our control, including the state of the capital markets and the prospects for our business. The necessary additional financing may not be available to us or may be available only on terms that would result in further dilution to the current owners of our common stock.
Our Company intends on seeking interim short-term financing to continue full legal compliance with its SEC filings, and to bring on the necessary personnel to begin its future development activities. Its working capital needs will be met largely from the sale of debt and public equity securities, until such time that funds provided by operations, if ever, are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability or classification of recorded assets and liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
Results of Operations
Year ended April 30, 2022 compared to the year ended April 30, 2021
For the years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, we had no revenue, respectively. The Company is working through its business plan to establish, develop and operate MLFB as a professional spring football league.
Total operating expenses for the year ended April 30, 2022 were $1,175,849 as compared to total operating expenses for the year ended April 30, 2021 of $386,186 or an increase of $789,663. The increase from 2021 to 2022 was primarily from a $290,031 increase in stock compensation expense, a $280,929 increase in compensation and a $166,984 increase in professional fees. The increase in stock compensation expense was related to (1) the issuance of 15,300,000 restricted $0.001 par value common shares and (2) 8,150,000 warrants to 13 key consultants, all of whom had made significant contributions to the Company over an extended period of time. All of the common shares and warrants were vested fully on the grant date. The 15,300,000 vested shares of common stock were valued at $0.0125 per share, the quoted market price on the date of grant and the Company recorded $191,250 of stock compensation expense in the accompanying Statement of Operations on the grant date of May 19, 2021. The Company evaluated the issuance of the issued warrants in accordance with ASC 505-50, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees, using the Black Scholes Pricing Model to determine the fair value. The fair value for the stock warrants was $98,781, which was recorded to stock compensation expense on the grant date of May 19, 2021.
The increase in compensation was related to the hiring of employees in 2022 with no comparable amount in 2021. Compensation includes salaries, taxes and benefits. The increase in professional fees was primarily from a $111,750 increase in marketing, a $30,264 increase in consulting and a $14,000 increase in legal. The increase in marketing was for marketing material related to the Company’s planned 2022 spring/summer football league with no comparable amount in 2021. The increase in consulting was primarily from a $20,000 payment for a football sports management program with no comparable amount in 2021. The increase in legal was primarily from services related to the Company’s Form 1-A SEC filing with no comparable amount in 2021. Additionally, the increase in expenses included a $5,000 write off of a stadium lease deposit that could not be transferred from 2019 to future MLFB planned football seasons in 2022 with no comparable amount in 2021.
Other income (expense) for the year ended April 30, 2022 was $493,850 of expense as compared to $200,805 of income for the year ended April 30, 2021, or an increase in expense of $694,655. The increase in expense from 2021 to 2022 was primarily from (1) a $394,762 decrease in gain from the change in fair value of conversion option liability, (2) $241,592 increase in interest expense and (3) $55,000 settlement expense with no comparable amount in 2021.
The increase in interest expense is primarily from (1) a $122,446 increase for the amortization of debt discounts on convertible promissory notes, (2) $51,813 increase in interest expense for debt and (3) a $67,333 increase in put premium liability expense related to convertible promissory notes.
We had a net loss of $1,669,699 and $185,381 for the years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
From inception, we have relied upon the infusion of capital through equity transactions and the issuance of debt to obtain liquidity. We had $673,181 of cash at April 30, 2022 and consequently, payment of operating expenses will have to come similarly from either equity capital to be raised from investors or from borrowed funds. There is no assurance that we will be successful in raising such additional equity capital or additional borrowings or if we can, that we can do so at a cost that management believes to be appropriate.
Cash Flow Activity
The following table summarizes selected items from our Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021:
Net Cash Used in Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $780,693 during the year ended April 30, 2022, compared to $213,518 used during the year ended April 30, 2021, or an increase in cash used of $567,175. After adjusting for non-cash expense items of $586,267 in 2022 and ($346,305) in 2021, adjusted net cash used in operations would be $194,426 in 2022 and 559,823 in 2021, or a decrease of $365,397. After making these non-cash adjustments, the previously discussed Results of Operations analysis shows that the increase in the net cash used in operating activities was primarily from a decrease of $394,762 in the fair value of conversion option liability from 2021 to 2022.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $461,410 during the year ended April 30, 2022, compared to $0 during the year ended April 30, 2021, or an increase of $461,410. The increase was primarily from $$460,410 for the purchase of football equipment and $500 for trademark filing fees with no comparable amount in 2021.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,895,506 of net cash during the year ended April 30, 2022, as compared to $229,500 provided during the year ended April 30, 2021, or an increase of $1,666,006. The increase in net cash provided from 2021 to 2022 was primarily from an increase of (1) $874,680 of proceeds from the issuance of convertible secured promissory notes and $57,000 of proceeds from the issuance of convertible unsecured promissory notes and (2) an increase of $1,042,826 from the sale of common stock. This was offset by the repayment of $277,500 of notes payable and convertible promissory notes in 2022 with no comparable amount in 2021. The increase of $1,042,826 from the sale of common stock was related to the Company’s Regulation 1-A offering.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
At April 30, 2022, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that we believe have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on our best knowledge of current and anticipated events, actual results could differ from the estimates.
