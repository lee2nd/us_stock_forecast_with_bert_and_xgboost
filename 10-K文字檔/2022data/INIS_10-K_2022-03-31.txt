Overview
International Isotopes Inc. (the “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our”) produces an FDA approved generic sodium iodide I-131 drug product, manufactures a wide range of nuclear medicine calibration and reference standards and provides radiochemicals for clinical research and life sciences. The Company also produces a variety of cobalt-60 products and supports clients contract manufacturing of radiopharmaceutical and radiochemical products. A more detailed description of each of these product lines and services along with a description of our business segments can be found in Item 1, “Business” within this Annual Report.
During 2021, we focused our efforts on achieving profitability in each of our core business segments and reached several significant goals. During 2021, we:
 Increased sales in the Radiochemical segment by 5% mainly due to a 9% increase in sales of our FDA approved generic sodium iodide I-131 drug product.
 Purchased the remaining 75.5% of RadQual, LLC, making RadQual, LLC and TI Services, LLC wholly-owned subsidiaries of International Isotopes, Inc.
 Successfully obtained cobalt-60 from the Department of Energy (DOE) to increase our cobalt source production activities which contributed to an 11% increase in Cobalt Product revenues.
 Developed several new products for our Nuclear Medicine products segment and expanded these products into Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging standards.
 Expanded sales of our nuclear medicine products through exercising our management opportunity with RadQual, LLC (RadQual). In particular, increased our international sales by utilizing the marketing and distribution expertise of our joint venture with RadQual, TI Services, LLC (TI Services); and
 Continued to pursue viable opportunities to obtain government or commercial contracts for depleted uranium de-conversion services for our U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensed de-conversion project in Lea County, New Mexico.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a reduction of sales within our nuclear medicine calibration standards segment and radiochemicals segment during 2020 and 2021. There was no discernable impact from COVID-19 to our cobalt products business segment during the period. The decrease in sales for 2020 and 2021 for our nuclear medicine calibration standards segment was the result of the temporary closure of many imaging clinics and suspension of elective or non-essential imaging procedures. In 2021, our sales recovered somewhat, but we believe there is still some pent-up customer demand that was not realized in 2021 due to continuing factors related to COVID-19. The sale of radiochemical products increased during the year; however, we believe the increases in revenue for 2020 and 2021 would have been greater were it not for the negative impact of COVID-19.
To-date we have not furloughed or terminated any employees as a result of the financial impact of COVID-19. The Company has only seen a limited impact in our raw material supply chain related to the COVID-19, primarily some plastics which have been in strong demand for certain types of PPE. Alternative sources of raw materials have been obtained without any interruption to production. With the heightened concern about corporate liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company believes that it has adequate cash to support continuing operations.
Business Strategy and Core Philosophies
Broadly defined, our business strategy is to continue to build our reputation as a leader in the cobalt, radiochemical, and nuclear medicine product industries, and to maximizing the revenue potential of our generic sodium iodine I-131 product and our expanded contract manufacturing capabilities. We also intend to continually seek ways to improve our customer service and expand our market share, with the ultimate goal of providing greater return to our shareholders. Specifically, we are continuously working with our customers to improve and develop new products to better serve the needs of the end user which, ultimately, we believe will boost product sales. A key part of our short-term and long-term business strategy is to develop and market additional generic drug products, similar to our sodium iodide I-131 product, which will offer customers high quality, reliable, and affordable products as well as increase our revenues. In addition, we will manage cash reserves and pursue additional financial support that will be structured in such a way to support further expansion of our products and services to exploit additional market opportunities.
Our core philosophy is to strive to provide high quality products and services as a profitable and environmentally conscious business, while offering excellent customer service and providing a safe and productive working environment for our employees. We operate in accordance with an ISO Quality Management System and in accordance with all current Good Manufacturing Practices under which we seek to maintain the highest level of quality and continuously improve our product manufacturing processes.
Results of Operations
Following is a summary of results of operations for 2021:
 Revenue in 2021 was approximately $9.6 million, which was a 3% increase compared to 2020;
 Our 2021 sales in our Radiochemical Products, Cobalt Products, and Nuclear Medicine Standards business segments increased by approximately 5%, 11%, and 5% respectively as compared to 2020;
 Our 2021 sales in Radiological Services and Fluorine Products business segments declined by approximately 26% and 83% respectively as compared to 2020 due to a phasing out of these business operations;
 Our total gross profit rate increased to 59% in 2021 from 58% in 2020; and
 Our operating costs for 2021 increased approximately 9% as compared 2020.
 We had a net loss of $902,347 in 2021 compared to a net profit of $2,202,651 in 2020
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020
The following table presents comparative revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Revenues
Total revenues in 2021 were $9,661,942, compared to $9,364,865 in 2020, which represents an increase of $297,047, or approximately 3%. The performance of each segment is discussed in the following paragraphs.
Radiochemical Products
Sales of radiochemical products accounted for approximately 44% of our total sales revenue in each of 2021 and 2020. Sales in this segment increased by $203,473, or approximately 5% to $4,275,044 as compared to $4,071,571 in 2020. The increase is a result of a $354,098 or 9% increase in radiochemical product sales year over year that was primarily the result of sales of our new generic sodium iodide I-131 drug product which was launched in March 2020. We expect sales of our new product to continue to trend upward. This increase in sales was partially offset by a reduction in payments received for contract manufacturing services year over year.
In February 2020, we received approval of an ANDA to the FDA for a sodium iodide radiopharmaceutical product for use in treatment of hyperthyroidism and carcinoma of the thyroid. We began sales of this product in March 2020, and these sales have had a significant positive impact on our revenues for 2020 and 2021. We expect continued growth in sales for this product in 2022 and beyond. This is the first of several potential generic drug products we plan to submit to the FDA in the coming years. Within this segment, we also currently distribute sodium iodide (I-131) as a radiochemical product. The radiochemical product is being used for a variety of applications including industrial use and use in investigational and clinical trials. We believe that the product enhancements we have made, in addition to the generic drug products we plan to submit to the FDA, should increase future sales in this business segment.
Additionally, we have provided contract manufacturing of radiochemical products for our customers. In 2019, we entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with a company and completed an expansion of our existing facility to support that and other contract manufacturing activities. Because of changing market conditions that company requested a termination of that contract manufacturing arrangement, and a settlement agreement was reached with that company in December 2020. As part of the settlement agreement, we received a termination payment consisting of cash and the other company’s relinquishment on all claims to expansion of our facility and all the equipment purchased by them. The settlement resulted in a significant one-time gain for us in 2020 as detailed under Other Income (Expense) below. In February 2022, we were able to sell these assets we received in the settlement agreement for another significant one-time gain. We are currently developing a business plan to produce additional radiopharmaceutical products or explore new contract manufacturing opportunities utilizing the cash from that sale.
Cobalt Products
Cobalt products sales accounted for approximately 14% of our total sales revenue in 2021 and approximately 13% in 2020. Sales in this segment increased by $128,937, or approximately 11%, in 2020 to $1,354,517, as compared to $1,225,580 in 2020. The increase in revenue within this segment was the result of increase Cobalt Sealed Source Manufacturing partially due to receipt of additional cobalt material from the ATR in 2021. Our sealed source manufacturing generates the majority of our revenue within this segment and sealed source sales depend on our ability to produce or procure this cobalt material.
In October 2014, we entered into a ten-year agreement with the DOE for the irradiation of cobalt targets. It takes many years to irradiate these cobalt targets to the desired level of activity and we anticipated having high specific activity cobalt available for our customers in 2020. However, the material had lower than expected activity and further receipt of material was delayed until about June 2021. At that point the material still had lower than expected activity, and we reached an agreement with the DOE to purchase the material at a discounted rate. Periodically we have been able to acquire recycled material that can be used to manufacture sealed sources for customers, and in some instances, our customers have supplied their own cobalt material for source fabrication. We also have access to additional low specific activity material produced by the DOE and expect to obtain, process, and sell additional cobalt products as a result during 2022.
We have entered into cobalt supply agreements with several customers. Pursuant to these contracts, we will supply bulk cobalt-60 and, in some cases, provide source manufacturing and installation services for the customer. The terms of these cobalt contracts require some advance progress payments from each customer. The funding received under these contracts has been recorded as unearned revenue under short- and long-term liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We recognized some of this revenue in prior years including in 2021 and 2020 when we fulfilled contract performance objectives by supplying sealed sources manufactured with cobalt from the ATR or alternate suppliers.
Nuclear Medicine Standards
Sales of nuclear medicine standards accounted for approximately 40% and 39%, of our total sales revenue in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sales in this segment increased by $169,192, or approximately 5%, to $3,842,447 in 2021, as compared to $3,673,255 in 2020. This increase in sales is due partially to reopening of many imaging clinics and suspension of elective or non-essential imaging procedures that were closed at certain times during 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the increase is due partially to easing of some interruption to distribution of our products due to temporary worldwide shipping restrictions the COVID-19 pandemic caused.
In 2017, affiliates of the Company purchased 75.5% of the member units of RadQual and at that time, we were named as one of the managing members of RadQual. Because of this change in member ownership and management, we have consolidated RadQual’s operations within the nuclear medicine segment for financial reporting since that time. For purposes of consolidation, all significant intercompany activity has been eliminated in the reporting process. In July 2021, we acquired the remaining 75.5% of the member units of RadQual. As a result of the acquisition, RadQual and TI Services are now our wholly-owned subsidiaries and are fully consolidated.
We anticipate that our sales of RadQual products will remain strong and that our ownership of RadQual will create significant future opportunities through new product development and expanding markets. Additionally, we will continue to work closely with TI Services using their expertise in marketing and distribution strategies to strengthen nuclear medicine product sales.
Radiological Services
Revenues from our Radiological Services segment accounted for approximately 2% of our total sales revenue in each of 2021 and 2020. Sales in this segment decreased by $55,980, or approximately 26%, from $216,139 in 2020, to $160,159 in 2021. The decrease in revenue is attributable to our termination of our contract for gemstone processing and field service activities.
Revenue from gemstone processing for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $131,650 compared to $172,555 for the same period in 2020. This was a decrease of $40,905, or approximately 24%. This decrease in revenue from gemstone processing is the result of termination of our gemstone processing activities. In January 2020, we notified our gemstone processing customer that the service contract with them was being terminated because the volume of gemstones sent for processing did not meet contract minimums. The termination activities and wrap up of this service substantially occurred in 2021 and the Company saw a steady decline in revenue from this service as production was wrapped up. In the first half of 2022, we plan to convert the spaces in the facility that had been used to perform this contract work into expanded Nuclear Medicine new product manufacturing. The loss in revenue expected from termination of the gemstone processing agreement is expected to be more than compensated for by the expansion of new nuclear medicine source products.
Revenue from field service work for the DOE had accounted for the majority of revenue in this segment. However, Radiological Field Services did not generate any Radiological Services segment sales in 2021 or 2020. This was the result the removal of this activity from our NRC license following the May 2019 contamination event. On May 2, 2019, our radiological services team was involved in a contamination event involving a breached cesium-137 source at an off-site location in the state of Washington. This work was being performed under a contract with the DOE. We have reviewed the results of the DOE investigation into this event and have implemented appropriate corrective actions. On January 5, 2021, we were notified by the DOE that we had been indemnified from any financial liability for this event under the Price Anderson Act (PAA).
Fluorine Products
In 2021, we had revenues related to Fluorine Products of $29,775 as compared to $178,350 in 2020. These revenues were related to an agreement to provide engineering and technical assistance services related to our fluorine products intellectual property. We may have additional revenue amounts in 2022 as this agreement continues. We developed our fluorine products in conjunction with the uranium de-conversion project, in order to take advantage of the anticipated need for depleted uranium de-conversion services. We established the Fluorine Products segment in 2004 to support production and sale of the gases produced using our FEP. In 2013, we made the decision to place continued formal design work on the proposed de-conversion facility on hold until such time that we are able to secure additional de-conversion services contracts. Until such time that work resumes on the project, we will limit our expenditures to essential items such as maintenance of the NRC license, land use agreements, communication with our prospective
FEP product customers, and interface with the State of New Mexico and Lea County officials. We continue to explore opportunities for government or commercial contracting for depleted uranium deconversion services that could still utilize FEP.
During 2021, we incurred $150,196 of planning and other expenses related to the de-conversion project, as compared to $142,896 in 2020. This is an increase of $7,300, or approximately 5%, and is the result of increased professional services allocated to this project in 2021. We expect that our costs in the future will be limited to essential items such as continued interactions with our customers, the state of New Mexico, and Lea County, New Mexico.
Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit
Cost of revenues for 2021 was $3,924,142 as compared to $3,904,869 in 2020, an increase of $19,273, or less than 1%. Gross profit percentage increased to 59% for 2021, from 58% in 2020. The following table presents revenues and cost of revenues information:
During 2021, we continued to monitor and control direct costs. Raw materials used in our radiochemical products and nuclear medicine standards represented the bulk of direct costs for 2021. In each of these business segments, we have purchase agreements in place with suppliers to obtain optimum pricing. Periodically, the cost increases for these raw materials or we may also use alternate supply sources for our material which might not carry pricing as favorable as our contracted suppliers.
In 2021, we were able increase gross profit percentage in our radiochemical segment with continued growth of sales of our new generic sodium iodide I-131 drug product. In 2021, our gross profit percentage in our nuclear medicine product segment decreased due to an increase in cost of cobalt material.
Operating Costs and Expenses
Total operating costs and expenses for 2021 were $6,418,592, as compared to $5,875,700 in 2020. This is an increase of $542,892, or approximately 9%.
The following table presents operating costs and expenses for 2021 as compared to 2020:
Salaries and contract labor expense decreased by $140,007, or approximately 5%, which was the result of reduced number of personnel. In addition, non-cash equity compensation expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $86,988 as compared to $88,180 for the same period in 2020. This is a decrease of $1,192, or approximately 1%, and is the result of equity compensation recorded for outstanding stock options granted to employees and non-employees.
General administrative and consulting expenses increased to $3,459,143 in 2021, as compared to $2,828,460 in 2020, an increase of $630,683, or approximately 22%. This increase is a result of increased licenses related to our FDA approved product, increased depreciation related to the expansion of our facility, increased cost of production supplies, increased professional services expense, and increased insurance expense.
Research and development expense was $271,714 for 2021, compared to $219,498 for 2020. This is an increase of $52,216, or approximately 24%. This increase in research and development expense was the result of increased costs associated with product development in our Nuclear Medicine business segment.
During both 2021 and 2020, we limited further investment in the planned de-conversion facility and limited further spending on the project only for expenses necessary to maintain licensing and continued interactions with New Mexico and Lea County. We will continue to delay further engineering work on the de-conversion project until we are able to secure additional contracts for de-conversion services.
Other Income (Expense)
The following table presents other income (expense) for 2021 as compared to 2020:
Other income was $683,253 for 2021 as compared to other income of 3,637,026 for 2020. This is a decrease in other income of $2,953,773. The decrease is due to income recognized as part of our termination of our manufacturing and supply agreement in 2020. As part of the termination agreement, we received $500,000 cash and title to improvements and equipment that was installed in our facility. These improvements and equipment are valued at approximately $2,500,000; this was also recorded as “other income.” Additionally in 2020, we had income from PPP SBA Loans converted to grant income of $546,100 which was recorded as “other income”. In 2021 we recognized “other income” an anticipated tax refund of approximately $440,000 for the Employer Retention Credit.
Interest income in 2021 was $111 as compared to $3,192 in 2020. This decrease of $3,081 was due to decreased interest rates earned cash balances held at banks and other institutions in interest-bearing accounts.
Interest expense increased during 2021, to $791,532, from $781,837 in 2020. This is an increase of $9,695, or approximately 1%. This increased interest expense was due to an increase in interest paid for notes payable for refunds of cobalt contracts. In 2021, non-cash interest expense was $401,077 as compared to $390,938 in 2020. This is an increase of $10,139. Interest expense includes dividends accrued on our Series C Preferred Stock (as defined below) issued in 2017. In 2021, we recorded interest expense of $244,955 for dividends payable on our Series C Preferred Stock.
In connection with the 2013 Promissory Note (as defined below), we recorded $30,000 of interest expense for each of 2021 and 2020, and approximately $13,000 of non-cash interest expense related to a debt discount feature on the 2013 Promissory Note for each of 2021 and 2020.
In connection with the 2019 Promissory Note (as defined below), we recorded $40,000 and $39,000 of interest expense for 2021 and 2020 respectively, and approximately $256,000 and $249,000 of non-cash interest expense related to a debt discount feature and issuance of warrants related to the 2019 Promissory Note for 2021 and 2020 respectively.
In connection with our 2017 issuance of Series C Preferred Stock, we issued Class M Warrants and Class N Warrants. We recorded approximately $131,000 and $128,000 of non-cash interest expense for 2021 and 2020 respectively in relation to these warrants.
Net Income or Loss
Our net loss was $902,347 in 2021, compared to a net income of $2,202,651 in 2020. This is a decrease in net income of $3,104,998. Our decrease in net income was the result of $2,916,837 of other income recognized in 2020 as part of our termination agreement of our manufacturing and supply agreement and increased operating expenses in 2021 as compared to 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
On December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $474,851 compared to $1,113,032 at December 31, 2020. Net cash used in operating activities was $161,914 in 2021, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $1,149,625 in 2020. This represents a decrease in cash provided in operating activities of approximately $1,311,539.
Accounts receivable at December 31, 2021 were $853,675 as compared to $796,128 at December 31, 2020. Our allowance for bad debt at December 31, 2021 was $18,910 as compared to $0 at December 31, 2020.
Inventories at December 31, 2021 were $924,775 as compared to $837,787 at December 31, 2020. A large portion of our inventory consists of Cobalt target inventory. For 2021, our target inventory accounted for approximately 48% of our work in process inventory. For 2020, our target inventory accounted for approximately 61% of our work in process inventory.
In 2020, as part of our year-end procedures, we evaluated our older target inventory held at the DOE ATR for impairment and concluded that these older design targets were fully impaired due to cumulative decay of the radioactive material. This impairment resulted in a $201,249 inventory impairment expense in 2020.
Included in our raw material inventory are raw cobalt, strontium, and other raw elements. In 2021, we determined that our raw material inventory was obsolete and fully impaired. This impairment resulted in a $33,609 inventory impairment expense in 2021.
Included in our work in process inventory are in-process and completed nuclear medicine products, irradiated cobalt and nuclear medicine-related materials and products.
We recognized a net loss of $902,347, for the year ended December 31, 2021, and have an accumulated deficit of $126,764,081 since inception. To date, our operations and plant and equipment expenditures have been funded principally from proceeds from public and private sales of debt and equity as well as through asset sales.
Net cash used in investing activities was $205,474 for 2021 and net cash provided in investing activities was $28,256 for 2020. During 2021, we used $205,474 to purchase equipment, and we used $7,744 to purchase equipment in 2020. We had proceeds from sale of equipment of $36,000 in 2020, and we had no proceeds from sale of equipment in 2021.
Financing activities used cash of $78,699 for the year ended December 31, 2021. We received proceeds from the sale of common stock in the amount of $18,890 and issued debt for proceeds of $351,255. We made principal payment on loans in the amount of $437,627 in 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, financing activities used cash of $637,109. We received proceeds from the sale of common stock in the amount of $16,475 and issued debt for proceeds of $871,100. In addition, we made principal payment on loans in the amount of $1,519,920 in 2020.
In February 2017, we entered into subscription agreements with certain investors, including two of our directors, for the sale of (i) an aggregate of 3,433 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, and (ii) Class M warrants to purchase an aggregate of 17,165,000 shares of our common stock (Class M Warrants), for gross proceeds of $3,433,000. The Series C Preferred Stock accrues dividends at a rate of 6% per annum, payable annually on February 17th of each year, commencing on February 17, 2018. Shares of Series C Preferred Stock are convertible at the option of the holder at any time into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price equal to $0.10 per share, subject to adjustment. At any time after February 17, 2019, if the volume-weighted average closing price of our common stock over a period of 90 consecutive trading days is greater than $0.25 per share, we may redeem all or any portion of the outstanding Series C Preferred Stock at the original purchase price per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, payable in shares of common stock. All outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock must be redeemed by us on February 17, 2022 at the original purchase price per share, payable in cash or shares of common stock, at the option of the holder. In February 2022, based on approval of majority of the Preferred C Holders, we extended the redemption date of the Series C Preferred Stock to February 17, 2023. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock do not have any voting rights, except as required by law and in connection with certain events as set forth in the Statement of Designation of the Series C Preferred Stock. The Class M Warrants were exercisable at an exercise price of $0.12 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth in the warrant, and expired in February 2022. In February 2022, 515,000 Class M Warrants were exercised at a price of $0.12. The Company received $61,800 for the exercise.
In March 2017, we amended our 8% unsecured debentures issued that were scheduled to mature in July 2017 (the Notes) and gave the noteholders certain additional rights (the Amendment). Pursuant to the Amendment, the Notes were modified to provide each holder the right, at the holder’s option and exercisable prior to May 12, 2017, to convert all or any portion of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest, into shares of our Series C Preferred Stock at a conversion price of $1,000 per share. Holders that elected to convert their Notes into Series C Preferred Stock received a warrant to purchase up to 3,750 shares of our common stock for each share of Series C Preferred Stock received upon conversion of the Notes, with each warrant having a five-year term, a cashless exercise feature, and an exercise price of $0.10 per share of common stock. As a result of this modification, an aggregate of $780,000 of the Notes was converted to 780 shares of Series C Preferred Stock and 2,925,000 Class N Warrants (as defined below). Residual interest was also paid to Note holders who converted of $1,515. The Notes matured in July 2017 and were repaid in full.
As discussed above, in May 2017, we issued 780 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, and Class N warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2,925,000 shares of our common stock (Class N Warrants) upon conversion of $780,000 of the Notes. The Series C Preferred Stock accrues dividends at a rate of 6% per annum, payable annually on February 17th of each year, commencing on February 17, 2018. Shares of Series C Preferred Stock are convertible at the option of the holder at any time into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price equal to $0.12 per share, subject to adjustment. At any time after February 17, 2019, if the volume-weighted average closing price of our common stock over a period of 90 consecutive trading days is greater than $0.25 per share, we may redeem all or any portion of the outstanding Series C Preferred Stock at the original purchase price per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, payable in shares of common stock. All outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock must be redeemed by us on February 17, 2022 at the original purchase price per share, payable in cash or shares of common stock, at the option of the holder. In February 2022, based on approval of majority of the Preferred C Holders, we extended the redemption date of the Series C Preferred Stock to February 17, 2023. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock do not have any voting rights, except as required by law and in connection with certain events as set forth in the Statement of Designation of the Series C Preferred Stock. The Class N Warrants are exercisable at an exercise price of $0.12 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth in the warrant, and have a term of five years.
In December 2013, we entered into a promissory note agreement with our then Chairman of the Board and one of our major shareholders, pursuant to which we borrowed $500,000 (the 2013 Promissory Note). The 2013 Promissory Note is secured and bears interest at 6% per annum and was originally due June 30, 2014. According to the terms of the 2013 Promissory Note, at any time, the lenders may settle any or all of the principal and accrued interest with shares of our common stock. In connection with the 2013 Promissory Note, each of the two lenders was issued 5,000,000 Class L warrants to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.06 per share.

The 2018 Promissory Note accrues interest at 6% per annum, which is payable upon maturity of the 2018 Promissory Note. The 2018 Promissory Note was originally unsecured and originally matured on August 1, 2018. At any time, the holder of the 2018 Promissory Note may elect to have any or all the principal and accrued interest settled with shares of our common stock based on the average price of the shares over the previous 20 trading days. Pursuant to an amendment to the 2018 Promissory Note in June 2018, the maturity date was extended to March 31, 2019 with all other provisions remaining unchanged.

In December 2019, we entered into a promissory note agreement with our Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board, former Chairman of the Board, and one of our major shareholders (the 2019 Promissory Note). The 2019 Promissory Note authorizes us to borrow up to $1,000,000. As of December 31, 2019, we borrowed $675,000 under the 2019 promissory note; the remaining $325,000 was borrowed in February 2020. The 2019 Promissory Note is secured and bears interest at 4% per annum and has a maturity date of December 31, 2022.

In connection with the 2019 Promissory Note, we are required to issue up to 30,000,000 Class O Warrants to purchase shares of our common stock at $0.045 per share (the Class O Warrants). The warrants are exercisable at an exercise price of $0.045 per share and have a term of five years.
In April 2021, we borrowed $250,000 from our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board pursuant to a promissory note (the April 2021 Promissory Note). The April 2021 Promissory Note bears an interest rate of 6% annually and is due December 31, 2022.

On April 23, 2020, through our wholly-owned subsidiary entered into a Loan Agreement and Promissory Note (collectively the “SBA Loan”) with KeyBank National Association pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) under the recently enacted Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”). The Company received total proceeds of $546,100 from the SBA Loan.
In July 2021, we received notification from the SBA that we received approval of forgiveness of the entire loan.
We expect that cash from operations, cash obtained through securities offerings, and our current cash balance will be sufficient to fund operations for the next twelve months. Although we may seek additional debt financing for our projects and operations in the future, there is no assurance that we will be able to secure additional debt financing on acceptable terms to us, or at all.
Goals for 2022
Based upon the investments we have made in our facilities and investments we anticipate making, and based on projects, and products developed thus far in 2022, we have the following goals for the rest of 2022:
 Continue to expand sales of our FDA approved sodium iodide I-131 generic drug product;
 Begin development of one or more new generic drug products to further enhance revenue production within our Radiochemical segment and identify additional future generic product opportunities;
 Expand sales of our nuclear medicine products and increase cash flow by offering new products and further expanding our international sales and distributor relationships;
 Develop a business plan to produce additional radiopharmaceutical products or explore new contract manufacturing opportunities.
 Support research and development of an advanced COVID test at a leading research hospital, with a goal of developing an accurate, inexpensive, at home saliva-based test.
 Continue to expand our customer base, increase revenues, reduce production and operating costs, and attempt to achieve profitability in our core business segment operations; and
 Continue to support essential tasks related to our de-conversion project and continue to pursue any opportunities to obtain additional contracts for depleted uranium de-conversion.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Asset retirement obligation - The asset retirement obligation is based on the expected future cash flows of the decommissioning funding plan. The decommissioning funding plan is based on the estimated number of hours of specific personnel, estimated wages and disposal costs. Once the decommissioning funding plan has been developed, we use a discount rate to determine the estimated current value of the liability.
New Accounting Standards
In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, “Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting”, which expands the scope of Topic 718 to include all share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. ASU 2018-07 specifies that Topic 718 applies to all share-based payment transactions in which the grantor acquires goods and services to be used or consumed in its own operations by issuing share-based payment awards. ASU 2018-07 also clarifies that Topic 718 does not apply to share-based payments used to effectively provide (1) financing to the issuer or (2) awards granted in conjunction with selling goods or services to customers as part of a contract accounted for under ASC 606. The amendments in ASU 2018-07 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We have assessed this topic and have concluded that there will be no impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
