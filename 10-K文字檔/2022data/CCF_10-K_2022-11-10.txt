Overview
General
The Company’s revenue increased in fiscal 2022, with all three of its reportable operating segments surpassing sales achieved in fiscal 2021. Despite the ongoing challenges of the global operating environment detailed below, the Company improved its gross margin percentage from the first half of fiscal 2022 to the second half, to end the year at 37.8%.
Despite the Company’s sales growth in fiscal 2022, and continued recovery of our gross margin percentage from the first half of the fiscal year, the Company continued to have a less favorable gross margin percentage in fiscal 2022 compared to the prior year. Higher operating costs seen in the fiscal year resulted in decreased operating income over the prior year. Chase’s relative gross margin in fiscal 2022 was negatively impacted by both: a.) increased input costs caused by continued global raw material inflationary pressures, increased logistics costs and a more competitive labor market; and b.) a less favorable sales mix, with sales price and demand-driven volume increase in its lower margin Industrial Tapes segment outpacing revenue gains seen in its higher margin Adhesives, Sealants and Additives, and Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segments. Further, the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment also experienced a less favorable sales mix within the segment itself due to historically less favorable margin products constituting a comparatively larger part of total segment sales compared to the prior year.
The Company continues to work with our customers and suppliers in an effort to counteract margin compression. However, given the delay experienced due to notification period requirements with certain customers and the continuation of upward inflationary pressures on input costs, fiscal 2022 results reflect a lag (in the first half of the year) in the realization of the full benefits of these efforts.
Revenue by Segment
The Company has three reportable operating segments summarized below:
Revenue from our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment increased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to sales price increases to counteract margin compression for our North American-focused functional additives product line. Revenue gains also reflect inorganic growth from our Emerging Technologies, Inc. (“ETi”) business acquired in the last month of the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Partially offsetting this increase in revenue was our reduction in sales volume from our worldwide-focused electronic and industrial coatings product line due to reduced demand acutely seen with sales within the automotive industry during the fiscal period.
Revenue from our Industrial Tapes segment surpassed the COVID-19 impacted prior year due to sales price increase and demand-driven growth in our wire and cable, specialty products, and pulling and detection product lines. Tempering the
increase in revenue sales was a decrease from our electronic materials product line, due to decreased demand in the Asian-end market.
Revenue from our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment showed modest increases in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to sales price increases to counteract margin compression from its coating and lining, building envelope and bridge and highway product lines. Partially offsetting these increases in revenue was a decrease in net sales volume from the pipeline coatings product line, due to COVID-19 overhang delays in products sold into Middle East and Asian markets outpacing North American sales gains in oil and gas pipeline repair and construction markets
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow
Chase Corporation’s balance sheet remained strong as of August 31, 2022, with cash on hand of $315,495,000 (or a net of $135,495,000 when excluding the $180,000,000 cash used to fund the NuCera acquisition on September 1, 2022 (the first day of fiscal 2023) and a current ratio of 12.4. The Company’s cash position remained healthy, as did cash flow from operations. The increase in cash balance (at the end of the fiscal year) was attributed to the $180,000,000 of cash drawn from its revolving credit facility to fund the acquisition of NuCera which closed on September 1, 2022 (the first day of fiscal 2023). See note 23 of the consolidated financial statements relating to this subsequent event.
Cash provided by operating activities of $34,859,000 for fiscal year 2022 was impacted by the Company’s strategic inventory build during the fiscal period, undertaken to help ensure our ability to satisfy customers’ demands and to address our elevated backlog caused in part by supply chain challenges. In addition, during the second fiscal quarter Chase Corporation paid out our largest ever annual cash dividend of $9,460,000 on December 9, 2021.
The Company had a $180,000,000 outstanding balance on its $200,000,000 revolving credit facility as of August 31, 2022 in order to fund the NuCera acquisition as noted above. The revolving credit facility, which was amended and restated in July 2021 (fourth quarter of fiscal 2021) to increase its capacity from $150,000,000 to $200,000,000, allows for the Company to pay down debt with excess cash, while retaining access to immediate liquidity to fund future accretive activities, including mergers and acquisitions, as they are identified. The new facility also gives Chase the ability to request an increase in this amount by an additional $100,000,000 ($300,000,000 in total borrowing capacity) at the individual or collective option of any of the lenders. The facility matures in July 2026.

Total Revenue
Total revenue in fiscal 2022 increased $32,324,000 or 11% to $325,660,000 from $293,336,000 in the prior year.
Revenue in the Company’s Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment increased $8,906,000 or 7% to $135,770,000 for the year ended August 31, 2022 compared to $126,864,000 in fiscal 2021. Positively impacting sales for the segment was increased revenue of $11,463,000 from its North American-focused functional additives product line, which includes inorganic growth attributable to the ETi business acquired in the last month of the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Additionally, the increase in revenue from its North American-focused functional additives was primarily attributed to sales price increases to counteract margin compression. Negatively impacting the segment’s sales were volume-driven decreases from its worldwide-focused electronic and industrial coatings line totaling $2,557,000 in fiscal 2022, with logistics and raw material supply constraints affecting demand in automotive verticals.
Revenue in the Company’s Industrial Tapes segment increased $23,081,000 or 19% to $143,954,000 for the year ended August 31, 2022 compared to $120,873,000 in fiscal 2021. Positively impacting sales for the segment were sales price and volume-driven increases of $23,538,000 due to its wire and cable, specialty products, and pulling and detection product lines, over the COVID-19 impacted prior year period. Negatively impacting the segment’s sales was a decrease in revenue from its electronic materials product line totaling $457,000 in fiscal 2022, due to decreased demand in the Asian end-market.
Revenue in the Company’s Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment increased $337,000 or 1% to $45,936,000 for the year ended August 31, 2022 compared to $45,599,000 for fiscal 2021. Positively impacting the segment sales for the fiscal year were sales price-driven increases to counteract margin compression in the Company’s coatings and lining, building envelope and bridge and highway product lines totaling $1,053,000. Negatively impacting the segment’s sales was a decrease in revenue from its pipeline coatings product line totaling $716,000, due to COVID-19 overhang delays in products sold into Middle East and Asian markets outpacing North American sales gains in oil and gas pipeline repair and construction markets.
Royalties and commissions in the Adhesive, Sealants and Additives segment totaled $3,198,000 and $3,534,000 for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in royalties and commissions in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to decreased sales of electronic and industrial coatings products by our licensed manufacturer in Asia.
Export sales from domestic operations to unaffiliated third parties was $36,305,000 and $33,439,000 for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in export sales from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2022 is reflective of the company-wide year-over-year increase in revenue attributed to a combination of sales price and demand-driven increases.
Cost of Products and Services Sold
Cost of products and services sold increased $28,048,000 or 16% to $202,708,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 compared to $174,660,000 in fiscal 2021.
The following table summarizes the relative percentages of cost of products and services sold to revenue for our three operating segments:
Cost of products and services sold in our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment was $80,619,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 compared to $71,805,000 in fiscal 2021. Cost of products and services sold in the Industrial Tapes segment was $96,132,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 compared to $77,013,000 in fiscal 2021. Cost of products sold in the Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment was $25,957,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 compared to $25,842,000 in fiscal 2021.
As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services increased for the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives and Industrial Tapes segments in fiscal 2022. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold for the Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment remained flat in fiscal 2022. The decrease in the relative gross margin for the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives and Industrial Tapes segments for the most recent fiscal year were due to continued global raw material inflationary pressures, increased logistics and freight costs and a more competitive labor market. Additionally, the Company’s overall relative margin was affected by a less favorable sales mix with sales price increases realized in our lower margin Industrial Tapes segment that outpaced sales price increase realized in our Adhesive, Sealants and Additives and Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segments. The Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment also experienced a less favorable sales mix within the segment itself, with historically less favorable margin products constituting a comparatively larger part of total segment sales. The Company has implemented and continues to implement customer price adjustments and continues to work with our customers and suppliers in an effort to counteract margin compression, but with a lag reflected in the first half of the fiscal year results.
With the composition of our finished goods and the markets we serve, the costs of certain commodities (including petroleum-based solvents, films, yarns, polymers and nonwovens, aluminum and copper foils, specialty papers, and various resins, adhesives and inks) both directly and indirectly affect the purchase price of our raw materials and the market demand for our product offerings. The Company diligently monitors raw material and commodities pricing across all its product lines in its efforts to preserve margins.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $2,338,000 or 5% to $54,438,000 during fiscal 2022 compared to $52,100,000 in fiscal 2021. The increase in activity is attributed to total increased selling and sales activity in the most recent fiscal year. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses were 17% and 18% of total revenue in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company continues to closely monitor spending with an emphasis on controlling costs and leveraging existing resources.
Research and Product Development Costs
Research and Product Development Costs increased $359,000 or 9% to $4,415,000 during fiscal 2022, compared to $4,056,000 in fiscal 2021. Research and development costs increased from fiscal 2021 to 2022 as the Company continued focused development work on strategic product lines.
Operations Optimization Costs
The Company completed the relocation of its corporate headquarters to another location within Westwood, MA during the year ended August 31, 2022. The move, part of the Company’s ongoing consolidation and optimization initiative, capitalizes on the hybrid work model utilized by many of Chase’s corporate and administrative employees and is expected to provide future operational cost savings. The new facility also consolidates and houses research and development operations previously conducted at the previous Westwood, MA and Woburn, MA locations. Operations optimization costs related to the Westwood move of $232,000 were expensed in the year. No future costs related to the move are anticipated.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2021, Chase announced to the employees at its Woburn, MA location that its adhesives systems operations, part of the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment’s electronic and industrial coatings product line, would be consolidating into the Company’s existing O'Hara Township, PA location. This rationalization and consolidation initiative-related announcement aligns with the second quarter announcement of the Company’s plan to move its sealant systems production from Newark, CA to Hickory, NC, described in more detail below. Chase Corporation obtained both the adhesive and sealants systems as part of its fiscal 2017 acquisition of the operations of
Resin Designs. The Company expensed $463,000 and $0 in fiscal 2022 and 2021, related to the move, and future costs related to its move are not anticipated to be significant to the consolidated financial statements.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, Chase began moving the sealant systems operations, part of the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment’s electronic and industrial coatings product line, from its Newark, CA location to its Hickory, NC facility. This is in line with the Company’s ongoing initiative to consolidate its manufacturing plants and streamline its existing processes. The sealant systems operations and Newark, CA location came to Chase Corporation as part of the fiscal 2017 acquisition of the operations of Resin Designs, and the Company’s lease there terminated in the current fiscal year. The Company recognized $147,000 and $977,000 in operations costs related to the move during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. This project is now substantially completed and any future costs related to this move are not anticipated to be significant to the consolidated financial statements.
During the third fiscal quarter of 2020, the Company implemented changes in its cost structure designed to address market changes brought on, in part, by COVID-19. These changes included a targeted reduction of approximately 4.5% of the Company’s global workforce. This reduction, which was contemplated pre-pandemic but catalyzed by COVID-19, resulted in the recognition of $183,000 in severance costs during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. The reduction in force, which impacted operations in the Blawnox, PA, Hickory, NC, Lenoir, NC, Evanston, IL, Oxford, MA and Westwood, MA facilities, was effective May 2020.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company commissioned third party led studies regarding the potential upgrading of the Company’s current worldwide ERP system. Chase Corporation reviewed the data and recommendations provided by the study and has made the decision to upgrade (beginning in fiscal 2023) from our current Oracle Legacy ERP System to the Oracle Fusion Cloud Platform. This upgrade will position us with a more advanced system to support business expansion, access to upgrades in functionality and a more modern system for operations, all within the Oracle Ecosystem. Additionally, the upgrade will be a multi-year, phased in approach that will mitigate any disruptions to our business. The Company recognized $150,000 in third party studies in fiscal 2020 and no costs were recognized in fiscal 2022 and 2021.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, Chase began moving the pulling and detection operations housed in its Granite Falls, NC location to its Hickory, NC facility. This is in line with the Company’s ongoing initiative to consolidate its manufacturing plants and streamline its existing processes. At the time, the pulling and detection operations were the only Chase-owned production operations in Granite Falls, NC, with the remaining portions of the building being either utilized for research and development or leased to a third party. The process of moving, including moving internal research and development capabilities, was substantially completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The Company recognized $559,000 in expense related to the move in the first half of fiscal 2020. This project is substantively completed. No costs were recorded after the first half of fiscal 2020, and any future costs related to this move are not anticipated to be significant to the consolidated financial statements.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, Chase commissioned engineering studies of certain legacy operations, machinery and locations related to the Company’s ongoing facility rationalization and consolidation initiative. Chase completed its review of the data and recommendations provided by the study in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. The Company recognized a gain of $170,000 in fiscal 2020, as certain amounts expensed in fiscal 2019 were refunded. Chase may utilize third party engineering, IT and other professional services firms in the future for similar optimization-related work. Given the ongoing nature of the facility rationalization and consolidation initiative, an estimate of future costs cannot currently be determined.
During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company announced to its employees the planned closing of its Pawtucket, RI manufacturing facility effective August 31, 2018. The manufacture of products previously produced in the Pawtucket, RI facility was substantially moved to Company facilities in Oxford, MA and Lenoir, NC during a two-month transition period. The Company completed the sale of its Pawtucket, RI location to a third-party in April 2020, for net proceeds totaling $1,810,000. This transaction resulted in a gain of $760,000 which was recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Also, during the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company recognized $85,000 in final Pawtucket, RI transition and exit costs, with no further costs related to this initiative anticipated in future periods.
Acquisition-Related Costs
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company incurred $4,000,000 of acquisition-related costs related to our acquisition of NuCera Solutions (“NuCera”) on September 1, 2022 (first day of fiscal 2023). See Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our subsequent event.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company incurred $128,000 of acquisition-related costs related to our acquisition of Emerging Technologies, Inc (“ETi”) on February 5, 2021. This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with applicable accounting standards, and all related professional service fees (including legal, accounting and actuarial fees) were expensed as incurred within the second quarter of fiscal 2021.
In fiscal 2020, the Company incurred $274,000 of costs related to our acquisition of ABchimie. This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with applicable accounting standards, and all related professional service fees (including banking, legal, accounting and actuarial fees) were expensed as incurred within the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020. The transaction was consummated at the beginning of fiscal 2021.
Gain on Sale of Real Estate
In August 2020, the Company finalized the sale of its Randolph, MA property for net proceeds of $1,805,000. This transaction resulted in a gain of $1,791,000 which was recorded during the quarter ended August 31, 2020 (fiscal 2020).
In April 2020, the Company finalized the sale of its Pawtucket, RI location for net proceeds of $1,810,000. This transaction resulted in a gain of $760,000 which was recorded during the quarter ended May 31, 2020 (fiscal 2020).
Write-down of certain assets under construction
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company wrote down the value of certain non-operating production assets related to the pipeline coatings product line, within the Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment. Given the nature and prospects of the equipment, the Company determined its then carrying value exceeded its fair value and recognized an expense of $100,000 related to the machinery.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, given the results and recommendations of a commissioned engineering study, the Company wrote down the value of certain non-operating production assets related to the pipeline coatings product line, within the Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment. Given the nature and prospects of the equipment, the Company determined its then carrying value exceeded its fair value and recognized an expense of $405,000 related to the machinery.
Loss on Contingent Consideration
As a component of the September 1, 2020 acquisition of ABchimie, the Company incurred a performance-based earn out liability potentially worth an additional €7,000,000 (approximately $8,330,000 at the time of the transaction) in consideration. Following its initial recording of an accrual for $928,000 at the acquisition date, $432,000 and $1,664,000 in expense related to upward adjustments to the performance-based earn out accrual were recorded to the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased $128,000 or 43% to $425,000 in fiscal 2022 compared to $297,000 in fiscal 2021. The increase in interest expense is related primarily to two days of interest expense recorded from long-term debt and unused commitment fee from our new revolving debt facility that commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.
Other Income (Expense)
Other income (expense) was income of $198,000 in fiscal 2022 compared to an expense of $760,000 in fiscal 2021, an increase of $958,000. Other income (expense) primarily includes foreign exchange gains (losses) caused by changes in exchange rates on transactions or balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, non-service cost components of periodic pension expense (including pension-related settlement costs due to the timing of lump-sum distributions), interest income, rental income and other non-trade/non-royalty/non-commission receipts. The increase in total other income in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was largely due to the recognition of a foreign exchange gain in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was 23.8% as compared to 23.3% in fiscal 2021.
For fiscal 2022 and 2021, the Company utilized the 21% Federal tax rate enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) passed in December 2017. Please see Note 7 - “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the effects of the Tax Act.
Net Income
Net income decreased $249,000 or less than 1% to $44,671,000 compared to $44,920,000 in fiscal 2021. The decrease in net income in the fiscal year was primarily due to a.) increased input costs caused by continued global raw material inflationary pressures, increased logistics costs and a more competitive labor market; and b.) a less favorable sales mix, with sales price and volume-driven increases in its lower margin Industrial Tapes segment outpacing sales price revenue gains seen in its higher margin Adhesive, Sealants and Additives and Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segments.
Liquidity and Sources of Capital
Our cash balance increased $196,066,000 to $315,495,000 (or to $135,495,000 when excluding the $180,000,000 cash used to fund the NuCera acquisition on September 1, 2022 (the first day of fiscal 2023)) from $119,429,000 at August 31, 2021. The increase in cash balance (at the end of the fiscal year) was attributed to the $180,000,000 of cash drawn from its revolving credit facility to fund the acquisition of NuCera which closed on September 1, 2022 (the first day of fiscal 2023), cash provided by operations of $34,859,000 offset by the $9,460,000 annual dividend in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and the strategic inventory build in fiscal 2022. Of the above-noted amounts, $28,951,000 and $26,309,000 were held outside the U.S. by Chase Corporation and our foreign subsidiaries as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Given our cash position and borrowing capability in the United States and the potential for increased investment and acquisitions in foreign jurisdictions, prior to the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we did not have a history of repatriating a significant portion of our foreign cash. With the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) in the second fiscal quarter of 2018, significant changes in the Internal Revenue Code were enacted, changing the U.S. taxable nature of previously unrepatriated foreign earnings. Following the passage of the Tax Act, the Company repatriated $10,499,000 in U.K. foreign earnings in fiscal 2018 and $17,230,000 in fiscal 2019. No additional amounts were repatriated in fiscal year 2020, 2021 or 2022. Please see Note 7 - “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the effects of the Tax Act.
Cash provided by operations was $34,859,000 for the year ended August 31, 2022 compared to $61,217,000 in fiscal 2021. Cash provided by operations during the current period was primarily related to operating income. Negatively impacting the cash flow from operations in fiscal 2022 was our continued strategic inventory build, undertaken to help ensure our ability to satisfy our customers’ demands and to address our elevated backlog caused in part by macroeconomic supply chain challenges
The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 12.4 (or 7.3 excluding the $180,000,000 cash used to fund the NuCera acquisition) as of August 31, 2022 compared to 6.5 as of August 31, 2021. The increase in our current ratio in fiscal 2022 was primarily attributable to increased cash funding from our revolving credit facility to fund the acquisition of NuCera and increase in inventory. See Note 23 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our subsequent event.
Cash used in investing activities was $4,427,000 for the year ended August 31, 2022 compared to $33,927,000 in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2021, cash used in investing activities was largely due to the cash on hand purchases of both ABchimie and ETi and cash spent on capital purchases of machinery and equipment.
Cash provided in financing activities was $169,845,000 for the year ended August 31, 2022 compared to $8,248,000 of cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021. Cash provided in financing activities in fiscal 2022 was primarily attributed to an increase of $180,000,000 from our existing credit facility to fund the NuCera acquisition, offset by the annual dividends of $9,460,000. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 was primarily attributed to our annual dividend payment of $7,557,000.
On November 10, 2022, Chase announced a cash dividend of $1.00 per share (totaling approximately $9,494,000) to shareholders of record on November 30, 2022 and payable on December 9, 2022.
On November 15, 2021, Chase announced a cash dividend of $1.00 per share (totaling $9,460,000) to shareholders of record on November 30, 2021 and payable on December 9, 2021.
On July 27, 2021 (the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021), the Company entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) by and among the Company and NEPTCO Incorporated (“NEPTCO”), each as borrowers, the guarantor subsidiaries party thereto, the financial institutions party thereto as Lenders, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, with participation from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., PNC Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Credit Agreement was entered into to amend, restate and extend the Company’s preexisting credit agreement (the “Prior Credit Agreement”), which had a maturity date of December 15, 2021, and to provide for additional liquidity to finance acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures, and for other general corporate purposes. Under the Credit Agreement, Chase obtained an increased revolving credit loan (the “Revolving Facility”), with borrowing capabilities not to exceed $200,000,000 at any time, with the ability to request an increase in this amount by an additional $100,000,000 at the individual or collective option of any of the Lenders. The applicable interest rate for the Revolving Facility and Term Loan (defined below) is based on the effective London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a range of 1.00% to 1.75%, depending on the consolidated net leverage ratio of Chase and its subsidiaries. As of August 31, 2022, the Company had $180,000,000 in long-term debt attributed to the acquisition of NuCera Solutions that closed on September 1, 2022. The long-term debt has an applicable interest rate of 5.5%.
The Credit Agreement has a five-year term with interest payments due at the end of the applicable LIBOR period (but in no event less frequently than the three-month anniversary of the commencement of such LIBOR period) and principal payment due at the expiration of the agreement, July 27, 2026. The Credit Agreement contains provisions that may replace LIBOR as the benchmark index under certain circumstances. In addition, the Company may elect a base rate option for all or a portion of the Revolving Facility, in which case interest payments shall be due with respect to such portion of the Revolving Facility on the last business day of each quarter. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, the Company may elect to convert all or a portion of the outstanding Revolving Facility into a new term loan twice during the term of the Revolving Facility (each, a “Term Loan”, and collectively with the Revolving Facility, the “Credit Facility”), which Term Loan shall be payable quarterly in equal installments sufficient to amortize the original principal amount of such Term Loan on a ten year amortization schedule.
The outstanding balance on the Credit Facility is guaranteed by all of Chase’s direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries, which collectively had a carrying value of approximately $314,662,000 at August 31, 2022. The Credit Facility is subject to restrictive covenants under the Credit Agreement, and financial covenants that require Chase and its subsidiaries to maintain certain financial ratios on a consolidated basis, including a consolidated net leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.00 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 (both defined in the Credit Agreement). Chase Corporation was in compliance with the debt covenants as of August 31, 2022. The Credit Agreement also places certain Lender-approval requirements as to the size of permitted acquisitions which may be entered into by the Company and its subsidiaries, and allows for a temporary step-up in the allowed consolidated leverage ratio for the four fiscal quarters ending after certain designated acquisitions. Prepayment is allowed by the Credit Agreement at any time during the term of the agreement, subject to customary notice requirements and the payment of customary LIBOR breakage fees.
The Prior Credit Agreement was an all-revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of $150,000,000, which could be increased by an additional $50,000,000 at the request of the Company and the individual or collective option of any of the lenders, and with an interest rate based on the effective LIBOR plus an additional amount in the range of 1.00% to 1.75%, depending on our consolidated net leverage ratio or, at the Company’s option, at the bank’s base lending rate. It was substantially available at July 27, 2021, the time of its amendment and restatement.
The Company has several ongoing capital projects, including upgrading the Company’s ERP system, as well as its facility rationalization and consolidation initiative, which are important to its long-term strategic goals. Machinery and equipment may be added as needed to increase capacity or enhance operating efficiencies in the Company’s production facilities.
We may acquire companies or other assets in future periods which are complementary to our business. The acquisition of ABchimie included a potential earnout based on performance of up to an additional €7,000,000 (approximately $8,330,000 at the time of the transaction), which the Company expects to pay with cash on hand if the applicable conditions are met. The acquisition of ETi included a $1,000,000 withholding, which was paid out by the Company on August 4, 2022 (eighteen months after the acquisition). The Company believes that its existing resources, including cash on hand and the Credit Agreement, together with cash generated from operations and additional bank borrowings, will be sufficient to fund its cash flow requirements through at least the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing, if needed, will be available on favorable terms, if at all.
To the extent that interest rates increase in future periods, we will assess the impact of these higher interest rates on the financial and cash flow projections of our potential acquisitions.
We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements.
Contractual Cash Obligations
The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at August 31, 2022 under operating leases and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (dollars in thousands):
We may be required to make payments related to our unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. The Company’s unrecognized tax benefits was $1,820,000 as of August 31, 2022. See Note 7 - “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
We also expect to make payments as needed to satisfy our funding obligations for our obligations for pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. As of August 31, 2022, we had recognized an accrued benefit plan liability of $8,996,000 representing the unfunded obligations of the pension benefit plans. See Note 9 - “Benefits and Pension Plans” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information, including expected pension benefit payments for the next 10 years.
The Company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed expected requirements or extend beyond one year.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
For discussion of the newly issued accounting pronouncements see “Recently Adopted Accounting Standards” in Note 1 - “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.
Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments, and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 - “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requires companies to provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies and estimates. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and operating results, and require management to make its most significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements. The SEC has defined critical accounting estimates as those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of a company.
Judgments, assumptions, and estimates are used for, but not limited to, the allowances for accounts receivable; inventory allowances; business combinations, goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets; revenue; income tax reserves; deferred income taxes; stock-based compensation; as well as discount and return rates used to calculate pension obligations. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates.
Business Combinations
We assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. The Company assesses the fair value of assets, including intangible assets, using a variety of methods, and each asset is measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant. The method used to estimate the fair values of intangible assets incorporates significant assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate an asset, including a market participant’s use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant. Assets recorded from the perspective of a market participant that are determined to not have economic use for the Company are expensed immediately. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. Transaction costs and restructuring costs associated with a transaction to acquire a business are expensed as incurred.
Impact of Inflation
The Company’s relative gross margin and sales mix was negatively impacted by continued global raw material inflationary pressures during fiscal 2022. Chase continues to work with our customers and suppliers in an effort to counteract margin compression in the form of sales price increases. In the event of significant inflation over an extended period of time, our continued efforts to recover cost increases could be hampered as a result of the competitive nature of the industries in which we operate. Future volatility of general price inflation or deflation and raw material cost and availability could adversely affect our financial results.
