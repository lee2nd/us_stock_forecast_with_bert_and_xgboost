Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
This discussion and analysis provides an overview of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”), which require the Company to make estimates and assumptions. The Company believes that its determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than the Company’s other significant accounting policies. Further, this estimate can be materially impacted by changes in market conditions or the actual or perceived financial condition of the Company’s borrowers, subjecting the Company to significant volatility of earnings.
A material estimate that is particularly susceptible to significant change is the determination of the allowance for loan losses. The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses that represents management’s estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and recorded as a reduction of the investment in loans. The allowance for loan losses is established through the provision for loan losses, which is a charge against earnings. Provision for loan losses is made to reserve for estimated probable losses on loans. The allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by the Company for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, trends in actual and forecasted credit quality, including delinquency, charge-off and bankruptcy rates, and current economic conditions that may affect a borrower’s ability to pay. The use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provision for loan losses. Management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate and reasonable. For additional discussion concerning the Company’s allowance for loan losses and related matters, see “Provision for Loan Losses” and “Allowance for Loan Losses” in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements. Given the very subjective nature of identifying and valuing loan losses, it is likely that well-informed individuals could make materially different assumptions, and could, therefore calculate a materially different allowance value. While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, changes in economic conditions may necessitate revisions in future years. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Corporation’s allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Corporation to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination.
Embassy Bancorp, Inc.
GENERAL
The Company is a Pennsylvania corporation organized in 2008 and registered as a bank holding company pursuant to the BHC Act. The Company was formed for purposes of acquiring the Bank in connection with the reorganization of the Bank into a bank holding company structure, which was consummated on November 11, 2008. Accordingly, the Company owns all of the capital stock of the Bank, giving the organization more flexibility in meeting its capital needs as the Company continues to grow.
The Bank, which is the Company’s primary operating subsidiary, was originally incorporated as a Pennsylvania bank on May 11, 2001 and opened its doors on November 6, 2001. It was formed by a group of local business persons and professionals with significant prior experience in community banking in the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania, the Bank’s primary market area.
Since its inception, the Board’s philosophy has been that, by running the Bank with a view toward the long term, only good things will happen for the Bank’s customers, team members, shareholders, and the Lehigh Valley community.
OVERVIEW
The Company’s assets grew $191.2 million from $1.4 billion at December 31, 2020 to $1.6 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase was due to an increase of $37.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, a $179.3 million increase in securities available for sale, and an increase of $17.2 million in net loans receivable (excluding PPP loans); offset by a decrease of $45.8 million in net PPP loans receivable due to net loan forgiveness. The growth in securities available for sale and net loans receivable was primarily funded by deposits. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to the forgiveness of PPP loans and an increase in deposits offset, in part, by Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (“PPPLF”) borrowings of $50.8 million paid off in full during the first quarter of 2021, purchases of available for sale securities, and funding of new loans.
Net loans receivable (excluding PPP loans) increased by $17.2 million to $1.10 billion at December 31, 2021 from $1.08 billion at December 31, 2020. The market continues to be very competitive and the Company is committed to maintaining a high-quality portfolio that returns a reasonable market rate. While the past and current economic and competitive conditions in the marketplace have created more competition for loans to credit-worthy customers, the Company continues to expand its market presence and continues to focus on developing a reputation as being a market leader in both commercial and consumer/mortgage lending. Management believes that this combination of relationship building, cross marketing and responsible underwriting will translate into continued long-term growth of a portfolio of quality loans and core deposit relationships, although there can be no assurance of this. The Company continues to monitor interest rate exposure of its interest-bearing assets and liabilities and believes that it is well positioned for any anticipated future market rate adjustments.
The Company's deposits grew $234.6 million from $1.2 billion at December 31, 2020 to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2021. The overall deposit growth was due to a highly effective relationship building, sales and marketing effort, which served to further increase the Company’s overall presence in the market it serves, along with deposit relationships developed as a result of cross-marketing efforts to its loan and other non-depository banking service customers. Also contributing to the growth is the increased usage of the Company’s online banking platform, competitively offered rates, the opening of a permanent branch office in Macungie and the opening of an office at 2002 West Liberty Street in Allentown, the continued convenience and efficiency of our branch network and branch personnel, and the injection of federal stimulus money into the economy from PPP funds and consumer stimulus payments. The Company also continues to capitalize on opportunities created by recent merger announcements, name changes, and competitive branch hour adjustments and/or closures in the Company’s market area, attracting customers looking to relocate to a local, reputable community bank.
The Company’s net income increased $4.0 million, or 31.0%, to $16.8 million in 2021 from $12.8 million in 2020. Diluted earnings per share increased to $2.22 in 2021 from $1.70 in 2020, and basic earnings per share increased to $2.23 in 2021 from $1.71 in 2020, respectively. The difference in net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 resulted from increases in net interest income and a decrease in the provision for loan losses; offset by a slight decrease in non-interest income and an increase in non-interest expenses and income tax expense.
Embassy Bancorp, Inc.
The Company’s pre-tax net income for 2021 included $2.7 million of PPP loan interest and fees. At December 31, 2021, the Company had $165 thousand of PPP origination fees not yet recognized into income.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
The majority of the Company’s earnings derives from net interest income, which is the difference between income earned on assets and the cost supporting those assets. The net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets. Earning assets are composed primarily of loans and investments, along with interest-bearing deposits with other banks. Interest-bearing deposits and borrowings make up the cost of funds. Non-interest bearing deposits and capital are other components representing funding sources. Changes in the volume and mix of assets and funding sources, along with the changes in yields earned and rates paid, determine changes in net interest income and net interest margin. The timing of deposit and loan growth also impacts net interest income.
Generally, changes in net interest income are measured by net interest rate spread and net interest margin. Interest rate spread is the mathematical difference between the average interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities. Interest margin represents the net interest yield on earning assets. The interest margin gives a reader a better indication of asset earning results when compared to peer groups or industry standards.
The Company determines interest rate spread and margin on both US GAAP and tax equivalent basis. The use of tax equivalent basis in determining interest rate spread and margin is considered a non-US GAAP measure. The Company believes use of this measure provides meaningful information to the reader of the consolidated financial statements when comparing taxable and non-taxable assets. However, it is supplemental to US GAAP which is used to prepare the Company’s consolidated financial statements and should not be read in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for US GAAP measures. In addition, the non-US GAAP measure may not be comparable to non-US GAAP measures reported by other companies. The tax rate used to calculate the tax equivalent adjustments was 21% for 2021 and 2020.
2021 Compared to 2020
Total interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $47.5 million, compared to $44.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Average earning assets were $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. The tax equivalent yield on average earning assets was 3.25% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 3.54% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Total interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased $2.4 million to $4.0 million, as compared to $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Average interest bearing liabilities were $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $948.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The yield on average interest bearing liabilities was 0.37% and 0.68% for the year ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
Net interest income increased $5.6 million, or 14.7%, to $43.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $37.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The improvement in net interest income is primarily the result of an increase in the interest and fee income from PPP loans, a decrease in the balance and rates of certificates of deposit and money markets, a decrease in the rates of interest bearing demand deposits, NOW, savings, and securities sold under agreement to repurchase. Also contributing to the improvement in net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was an increase in the balances of taxable loans, taxable and non-taxable investments, federal funds sold, and interest bearing deposits with banks, and a decrease in interest expense from PPPLF borrowings. The improvements were offset, in part, by a decrease in the rates of taxable loans, taxable and non-taxable investments, fed funds sold and interest bearing deposits with banks, and an increase in the balance of interest bearing demand deposits, NOW, savings, securities sold under agreement to repurchase, and long-term FHLB borrowings. The Company’s net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 2.96% on a US GAAP basis and 2.98% on a non-US GAAP basis, compared to 3.01% on a US GAAP basis and 3.03% on a non-US GAAP basis for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Embassy Bancorp, Inc.
The Company’s net interest margin was also affected by the balance of PPP loans, which bear interest at a rate of 1.0%, and PPPLF borrowings, which bore an interest rate of 0.35% and were paid off in early February 2021. The net interest margin on a tax equivalent (non-US GAAP) basis excluding PPP loans and PPP interest income and PPPLF borrowings interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 2.86%, compared to 3.04% for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Provision for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged against income. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.
The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level management considers to be adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated. Management’s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change. The Company has determined, because of the 100% SBA guarantee, that no allowance for loan losses is required on PPP loans.
Embassy Bancorp, Inc.
The allowance consists of general, specific, qualitative, and unallocated components. The general component covers non-classified loans and classified loans not considered impaired, and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired and/or restructured. For loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management’s estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio. An allowance for loan losses is not maintained on loans designated as held for sale.
A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and/or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for commercial and construction loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral-dependent.
Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. Accordingly, the Company does not separately identify individual consumer and home equity loans for impairment disclosures, unless such loans are the subject of a restructuring agreement or there is a possible loss expected.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the provision for loan losses was $915 thousand, compared to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Gross loans, excluding PPP loans, grew $18.4 million, or 1.7%, in 2021 over 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, there were $4 thousand in charge-offs and $3 thousand in recoveries, as compared to no charge-offs and $28 thousand in recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2020. The provision for loan losses is a function of the allowance for loan loss methodology that the Bank uses to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for inherent loan losses after net charge-offs have been deducted. During the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company adjusted the economic risk factor, loan modifications risk factor, and other external factor methodologies to incorporate the current economic implications, unemployment rates and amount of loan modifications due to the COVID-19 pandemic. See further discussion following in the “Credit Risk and Loan Quality” section of the Bank’s considerations of its December 31, 2021 allowance for loan loss levels. The allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2021 was $11.5 million representing 1.04% of outstanding loans receivable (excluding PPP loans), as compared to $10.6 million as of December 31, 2020, representing 0.97% of outstanding loans receivable. Based principally on economic conditions, asset quality, and loan-loss experience, including that of comparable institutions in the Bank’s market area, the allowance is believed to be adequate to absorb any losses inherent in the portfolio. Because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate, or that material increases will not be necessary should the quality of the loans deteriorate. The Bank has not participated in any sub-prime lending activity.
Non-interest Income
Non-interest income is derived from the Company’s operations and represents primarily merchant and credit card processing fees, debit card interchange fees, service fees on deposit and loan relationships and income from bank owned life insurance. Non-interest income also may include net gains and losses from the sale of available for sale securities, loans, and other real estate owned.
Total non-interest income remained relatively flat at $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The slight decrease is, in part, attributable to a decrease in bank owned life insurance income of $323 thousand. The decrease in the bank owned life insurance income was driven by the effect market conditions had
Embassy Bancorp, Inc.
on underlying life insurance assets, particularly the separate account life insurance assets, offset by income on the $4.0 million of additional bank owned life insurance purchased during the fourth quarter of 2020. Additional decreases in non-interest income are attributable to a decrease of $104 thousand in gain on the sale of securities and a decrease of $59 thousand on the gain on sale of loans. The decrease was offset by an increase in merchant and credit card processing fees of $56 thousand, an increase in debit card interchange fees of $219 thousand, in part, due to less activity in the second quarter of 2020 from the COVID-19 pandemic and an expanding customer base, and an increase of $63 thousand in other service fees, in part, due to the Company waiving overdraft fees during part of the second quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, wire fees, and an expanding customer base. There was also a gain on the sale of other real estate owned of $103 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2021. As the deposit customer account base continues to grow and the Company continues to mature and develop additional sources of fee income, non-interest income is expected to become a more significant contributor to the overall profitability of the Company. Currently, and unlike many in the industry, the Company does not derive additional non-interest fee income by selling its mortgages in the secondary market, nor does it offer trust or investment/brokerage services to its customers.
Non-interest Expense
Non-interest expenses represent the normal operating expenses of the Company. These expenses include salaries, employee benefits, occupancy, equipment, data processing, advertising and other expenses related to the overall operation of the Company.
Non-interest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $24.1 million, compared to $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in non-interest expenses is primarily due to an increase of $1.1 million, or 9.5%, over 2020, in salaries and employee benefits. The Company had a 10.4% increase in full-time equivalent employees from ninety-six (96) at December 31, 2020 to one hundred six (106) at December 31, 2021, respectively. The increase in the number of employees, together with the annual increases in salaries and benefits, increase in contributions to employee retirement plans, increase in employee taxes, increase in health insurance cost, increase in stock grant expense, and a decrease in deferred loan costs primarily associated with fewer PPP loan originations, offset by a decrease in non-qualified pension expense, resulted in an increase in overall salary and benefits. Additional increases in non-interest expenses are attributable to an increase of $357 thousand in occupancy and equipment due in part to the opening of the Macungie permanent branch in November 2020 and the opening and rent for the Company’s new branch office at 2002 West Liberty Street in Allentown, Pennsylvania, along with an increase in building repair and maintenance and equipment expense, an increase of $356 thousand in data processing due primarily to e-commerce, the expanding customer base, fees associated with PPP loan forgiveness and the implementation fees for the Company’s upcoming transition to a new online banking platform, an increase of $166 thousand in FDIC insurance due, in part, to FDIC credits applied in the first quarter of 2020 and an increase in the Company’s assessment base, a $51 thousand increase in loan and real estate expenses, and a $155 thousand increase in other expenses due, in part, to an increase in operating expenses, bank shares tax, director compensation, and debit card losses. These increases in non-interest expenses were offset, in part, by a decrease of $109 thousand in advertising and promotions from shifts in marketing strategies and less website and social media expense, less promotions, and less public relations expense.
A breakdown of other non-interest expenses is included in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes was $4.1 million and $2.9 million for December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The effective rate on income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was 19.5% and 18.6%, respectively. The increase in the tax rate is, in part, the result of change in the mix of taxable and tax free loans and investments and the decrease in income on bank owned life insurance.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
Securities
The Company’s securities portfolio is classified, in its entirety, as “available for sale.” Management believes that a portfolio classification of available for sale allows complete flexibility in the management of the investment portfolio. Using this classification, the Company intends to hold these securities for an indefinite amount of time, but not necessarily to maturity. Such securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. The portfolio is structured to provide maximum return on investments while providing a consistent source of liquidity and meeting strict risk standards. The Company holds no high-risk, non-investment grade, securities or derivatives as of December 31, 2021.
The Company’s securities portfolio was $310.3 million at December 31, 2021, a $179.3 million increase from securities of $130.9 million at December 31, 2020. The Company’s securities have increased primarily due to purchases in the amount of $236.2 million, offset by a combination of investment principal pay-downs, maturities, and calls totaling $48.2 million, the sale of securities totaling $3.3 million, including a realized gain of $24 thousand, and a decrease in unrealized gains of $5.2 million. The carrying value of the securities portfolio as of December 31, 2021 includes a net unrealized loss of $1.5 million, which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity net of income tax effect. This compares to a net unrealized gain of $3.7 million at December 31, 2020. The current unrealized loss position of the securities portfolio is due to changes in market interest rates since purchase. No securities are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired.
The following table sets forth the composition of the securities portfolio at fair value as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Securities by Maturities
Loans
The loan portfolio comprises a major component of the Company’s earning assets. All of the Company’s loans are to domestic borrowers. Total net loans receivable (excluding PPP loans) at December 31, 2021 increased $17.2 million to $1.10 billion from $1.08 billion at December 31, 2020. The gross loan-to-deposit ratio (excluding PPP loans) decreased from 88% at December 31, 2020 to 76% at December 31, 2021. The Company’s loan portfolio (excluding PPP loans) at December 31, 2021 was comprised of residential real estate and consumer loans of $619.3 million, an increase of $42.3 million from December 31, 2020, and commercial loans of $488.7 million, a decrease of $23.9 million from December 31, 2020. The commercial loan decrease was caused, in large part, by several large non-PPP loan payoffs, in the month of December 2021, consisting of seven (7) loans totaling $15.3 million, due primarily to real estate investors taking advantage of favorable real estate values. The Company has not originated, nor does it intend to originate, sub-prime mortgage loans. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is participating in the SBA PPP program to support the needs of its small business clients. PPP loans receivable at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was $8.6 million and $54.3 million, respectively. Including PPP loans receivable, the gross loan-to-deposit ratio was 76% and 93% at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.
Payment accommodations related to COVID-19 assistance were in the form of short-term (six months or less) principal and/or interest deferrals and the loans were considered current at the time of the accommodation. These payment accommodations were made in accordance with Section 4013 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act and the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus and the Company will not be categorizing these modifications as troubled debt restructurings. As of December 31, 2021, there are one hundred ninety-nine (199) loans totaling $116.4 million, for which the payment accommodation period has ended and have resumed payments under their original contractual terms.

The following table shows the maturities of the commercial and consumer loan portfolios and the loans subject to interest rate fluctuations at December 31, 2021.
Credit Risk and Loan Quality
The allowance for loan losses increased $914 thousand to $11.5 million at December 31, 2021 from $10.6 million at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the allowance for loan losses represented 1.03% and 0.92% of total loans receivable, respectively. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the allowance for loan losses represented 1.04% and 0.97%, respectively, of total loans receivable excluding PPP loans, which are guaranteed by the SBA. During 2020, the Company adjusted the economic risk factor, loan modifications risk factor, and other external factor methodologies to incorporate the current economic implications, unemployment rates and amount of loan modifications due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to the increase in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non-PPP loans. During 2021, the Company again adjusted the other external factor methodology, due to uncertainty with the post COVID-19 pandemic economy, leading to a further increase in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non-PPP loans. In determining its allowance for loan loss level at December 31, 2021, the Company considered the health and composition of its loan portfolio going into and during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Embassy Bancorp, Inc.
All loans that received a CARES Act Section 4013 modification are provided additional qualitative reserve in the Company’s allowance for loan loss calculation. At December 31, 2021, approximately 96% of the Company’s loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate. Less than 5% of the Company’s loan portfolio is to borrowers in the more particularly hard-hit industries (including the travel and hotel industry, the full-service and limited-service restaurant industries, and the assisted living facilities industry) and the Company has no direct international exposure. The Company is not required to adopt the Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) FASB accounting standard until 2023. Based upon current economic conditions, the composition of the loan portfolio, the perceived credit risk in the portfolio and loan-loss experience of the Company and comparable institutions in the Company’s market area, management feels the allowance is adequate to absorb reasonably anticipated losses. The Company will continue to evaluate the allowance for loan losses as new information becomes available.
In certain circumstances in which the Company has deemed it prudent for reasons related to a borrower’s financial condition, the Company has agreed to restructure certain loans (referred to as troubled debt restructurings). Troubled debt restructuring loans, which are considered non-performing loans, outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 totaled $2.4 million and $2.6 million, respectively. Generally, a loan is classified as nonaccrual when it is determined that the collection of all or a portion of interest or principal is doubtful or when a default of interest or principal has existed for 90 days or more, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. A non-performing loan may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured. Non-accrual loans outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 totaled $242 thousand and $274 thousand, respectively. The Company’s non-performing loans to total loans receivable was 0.23% at December 31, 2021, compared to 0.25% at December 31, 2020. The Company’s nonperforming loans to total loans receivable excluding PPP loans was 0.23% at December 31, 2021, compared to 0.26% at December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, there were $4 thousand in charge-offs and $3 thousand in recoveries, as compared to no charge-offs and $28 thousand in recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 the Company had $217 thousand and zero, respectively, in recorded investment in consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate property that is in the process of foreclosure.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had no foreclosed assets. The details for the non-performing loans and assets are included in the following table:

Allowance for Loan Losses
Based upon current economic conditions, the composition of the loan portfolio and loan loss experience of comparable institutions in the Company’s market areas, an allowance for loan losses has been provided at 1.04% of outstanding loans receivable (excluding PPP loans). Based on its knowledge of the portfolio and current economic conditions, management believes that, as of December 31, 2021, the allowance is adequate to absorb reasonably anticipated losses. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $3.5 million of impaired loans (defined as a loan that management feels probable the Company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or loans considered to be troubled debt restructurings) compared to $3.6 million at December 31, 2020. Most of the Company’s impaired loans required no specific reserves due to adequate collateral. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had impaired loans of $1.1 million requiring a specific reserve of $164 thousand. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had impaired loans of $1.5 million requiring a specific reserve of $169 thousand.
The activity in the allowance for loan losses is shown in the following table, as well as period end loans receivable and the allowance for loan losses as a percent of the total loan portfolio (excluding PPP loans):

The following table details the allocation of the allowance for loan losses to various loan categories (excluding PPP loans) and the related percent of total loans in each category. While allocations have been established for particular loan categories, management considers the entire allowance to be available to absorb losses in any category.
Deposits
As growth continues, the Company expects that the principal sources of its funds will be deposits, consisting of demand deposits, NOW accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts, and certificates of deposit from the local market areas surrounding the Company’s offices. These accounts provide the Company with a source of fee income and a relatively stable source of funds.
Total deposits at December 31, 2021 were $1.5 billion, an increase of $234.6 million, or 19.0%, over total deposits of $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2020. The increase in the Company’s deposits was due to an increase of $102.1 million in demand, NOW and money market deposits and a $192.9 million increase in savings deposits; offset by a decrease of $60.3 million in time deposits. The growth in total deposits was due to organic growth of new and existing customers and the injection of federal stimulus money into the economy from PPP funds and consumer stimulus payments. The shift out of time deposits was primarily due to promotions rolling off into lower yielding demand and savings deposit accounts due to the current rate environment. The funds were primarily used to fund new loan growth, purchase securities, and to pay off PPPLF borrowings. The following table reflects the Company’s deposits by category for the periods indicated. All deposits are domestic deposits.

The following table displays the maturities and the amounts of the Company’s certificates of deposit of $250,000 or more:
As a FDIC member institution, the Company’s deposits are insured to a maximum of $250,000 per depositor through the DIF that is administered by the FDIC and each institution is required to pay quarterly deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC.
Liquidity
Liquidity is a measure of the Company’s ability to meet the demands required for the funding of loans and to meet depositors’ requirements for use of their funds. The Company’s sources of liquidity are cash balances, due from banks, and federal funds sold. Cash and cash equivalents were $169.7 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $131.9 million at December 31, 2020. There are other sources of liquidity that are available to the Company, as well, including those described below.
Additional asset liquidity sources include principal and interest payments from investment securities, unpledged investment securities, and loan portfolios. Long-term liquidity needs may be met by selling unpledged securities available for sale, selling or participating loans, or raising additional capital. At December 31, 2021, the Company had $310.3 million of available for sale securities, compared to $130.9 million at December 31, 2020. Securities with carrying values of approximately $114.0 million and $98.7 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, were pledged as collateral to secure securities sold under agreements to repurchase, public deposits, and for other purposes required or permitted by law.
At December 31, 2021, the Bank had a maximum borrowing capacity for short-term and long-term advances from the FHLB of approximately $717.6 million. This borrowing capacity with the FHLB includes a line of credit of $150.0 million. There were no short-term FHLB advances outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. There were $14.7 million in long-term FHLB advances outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. All FHLB borrowings are secured by qualifying assets of the Bank.

The Bank has a federal funds line of credit with the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank (“ACBB”) of $10.0 million, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Advances from this line are unsecured.
As further described in Note 9, in October 2021, the Company obtained a $5.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit facility from the ACBB, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2021.
As described in Note 2, the Bank had long-term PPPLF borrowings, term funding to depository institutions that originate loans to small businesses under the PPP, through the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia of $50.8 million as of December 31, 2020. These borrowings were repaid in full in February 2021. All PPPLF borrowings were secured by PPP loans. PPP loans that were pledged to secure PPPLF extensions of credit are excluded from leverage ratio calculations.
Because of the composition of the Company’s balance sheet, its strong capital base, deposit growth, and borrowing capacity, the Company believes that it remains well positioned with respect to liquidity. While it is desirable to be liquid, it has the effect of a lower interest margin. The majority of the Company’s funds are invested in loans; however, a portion is invested in investment securities that generally carry a lower yield. The Company has no investment in or financial relationship with any unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on liquidity or capital resources.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company’s consolidated financial statements do not reflect various off-balance sheet arrangements that are made in the normal course of business, which may involve some liquidity risk. These commitments consist of unfunded loans, lines of credit, and letters of credit made under the same standards as on-balance sheet loan instruments. These off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 totaled $164.7 million and $140.8 million, respectively. Because these instruments have fixed maturity dates, and because many of them will expire without being drawn upon, they do not generally present any significant liquidity risk to the Company. For further information see Note 5. Management is of the opinion that the Company’s liquidity is sufficient to meet its anticipated needs. Management will continue to evaluate the Company’s liquidity position for changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Capital Resources and Adequacy
Total stockholders’ equity was $122.5 million as of December 31, 2021, representing a net increase of $10.3 million from December 31, 2020. The increase in capital was primarily the result of the net income of $16.8 million and an increase in common stock of $51 thousand and an increase in surplus of $558 thousand due to restricted stock grants, the exercise of stock options, and employee stock purchases with compensation expense, offset by dividends paid of $2.3 million, a decrease of $4.1 million in unrealized gains on available for sale securities, and treasury stock repurchases of $670 thousand.
The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by banking regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements.
The regulations require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk weighted assets (as defined), and Tier 1 capital to average assets (as defined). As of December 31, 2021, the Bank met the minimum requirements. In addition, the Bank’s capital ratios exceeded the amounts required to be considered “well capitalized” as defined in the regulations.

The following table provides a comparison of the Bank’s risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios:
In addition to the risk-based capital guidelines, the federal banking regulators established minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) guidelines for bank holding companies. These guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of 3% for those bank holding companies which have the highest regulatory examination ratings and are not contemplating or experiencing significant growth or expansion. All other bank holding companies are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4%.
The capital ratios to be considered “well capitalized” under the new capital rules are: common equity of 6.5%, Tier 1 leverage of 5%, Tier 1 risk-based capital of 8%, and Total Risk-Based capital of 10%.
The Company qualifies as a small bank holding company and is not subject to the Federal Reserve’s consolidated capital rules, although an institution that so qualifies may continue to file reports that include such capital amounts and ratios. The Company has elected to continue to report those amounts and ratios.
The following table provides the Company’s risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios:

Interest Rate Risk Management
A principal objective of the Company’s asset/liability management policy is to minimize the Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates by an ongoing review of the maturity and repricing of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO), which meets as part of the Board of Directors meeting, oversees this review, which establishes policies to control interest rate sensitivity. Interest rate sensitivity is the volatility of a company’s earnings resulting from a movement in market interest rates. The Company monitors rate sensitivity in order to reduce vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations while maintaining adequate capital levels and acceptable levels of liquidity. The Company’s asset/liability management policy, monthly and quarterly financial reports, along with simulation modeling, supplies management with guidelines to evaluate and manage rate sensitivity.

GAP, a measure of the difference in volume between interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities, is a means of monitoring the sensitivity of a financial institution to changes in interest rates. The chart below provides an indicator of the rate sensitivity of the Company. NOW and savings accounts are categorized by their respective estimated decay rates. The Company is asset sensitive, which means that if interest rates fall, interest income will fall faster than interest expense and net interest income will likely decrease. If interest rates rise, interest income will rise faster than interest expense and net interest income will likely increase. The Company continues to monitor interest rate exposure of its interest bearing assets and liabilities and believes that it is well positioned for any future market rate adjustments.

Based on a twelve-month forecast of the balance sheet, the following table sets forth our interest rate risk profile at December 31, 2021. For income simulation purposes, personal and business savings accounts reprice every three months, personal and business NOW accounts reprice every four months and personal and business money market accounts reprice every two months. The impact on net interest income, illustrated in the following table, would vary if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from that indicated by the assumptions.
Return on Assets and Equity
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the return on average assets was 1.11% the return on average equity was 14.24% and the ratio of average shareholders’ equity to average total assets was 7.76%.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the return on average assets was 0.98% the return on average equity was 12.07% and the ratio of average shareholders’ equity to average total assets was 8.13%.
Dividend Payout Ratio
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the dividend payout ratio was 13.42% and 12.83%, respectively.
Effects of Inflation
The majority of assets and liabilities of the Company are monetary in nature, and therefore, differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories. The precise impact of inflation upon the Company is difficult to measure. Inflation may affect the borrowing needs of consumers, thereby impacting the growth rate of the Company’s assets. Inflation may also affect the general level of interest rates, which can have a direct bearing on the Company.
