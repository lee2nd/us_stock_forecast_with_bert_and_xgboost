Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This discussion and analysis reflects our financial statements and other relevant statistical data, and is intended to enhance your understanding of the financial condition and results of operations of Catalyst Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) and its wholly owned subsidiary, St. Landry Homestead Federal Savings Bank (the “Bank”). The information in this section has been derived from the audited financial statements, which appear in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information in this section should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included herein in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and the description of our business included herein in “Item 1. Business”.
Overview
Catalyst Bancorp , Inc. was incorporated by St. Landry Homestead Federal Savings Bank in February 2021 as part of the conversion of St. Landry Homestead from the mutual to the stock form of organization (the “Conversion). The Conversion was completed on October 12, 2021, at which time the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Bank and became the holding company for the Bank. As a result of the Conversion, the Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of Catalyst Bancorp Inc.
Founded in 1922, the Bank is a community-oriented savings bank serving the banking needs of customers in the Acadiana region of south-central Louisiana. We are headquartered in Opelousas, Louisiana and serve our customers through six full-service branches located in Carencro, Eunice, Lafayette, Opelousas, and Port Barre. Our primary business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and using those funds together with funds we borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of Dallas and other sources to originate loans to our customers and invest in securities. At December 31, 2021, we had total assets of $285.3 million, including total loans of $131.8 million and total investment securities of $101.8 million, total deposits of $176.8 million and total shareholders’ equity of $98.3 million. We had net income of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a net loss of $703,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The primary reasons for the improvement in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, were a $1.7 million increase in non-interest income in 2021, due primarily to the recognition into income of a $1.8 million grant from the Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”) Rapid Response Program, and a $660,000 reversal to the allowance for loan losses in 2021 compared to a $985,000 provision to the allowance for loan losses in 2020.
Historically, we operated as a traditional thrift relying on long-term, single-family residential mortgage loans secured by properties located primarily in St. Landry Parish and adjoining areas to generate interest income. As discussed below, we are re-focusing our business strategy to a relationship-based community bank model. The Conversion and offering were important factors in our efforts to become a more dynamic, profitable and growing institution.
Our results of operations depend, to a large extent, on net interest income, which is the difference between the income earned on our loan and investment portfolios and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Our net interest income is largely determined by our net interest spread, which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, and the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Results of operations are also affected by our provisions for loan losses, fee income and other non-interest income and non-interest expense. Non-interest expense principally consists of compensation, office occupancy and equipment expense, data processing, advertising and business promotion and other expense. We expect that our non-interest expenses will increase as we grow and expand our operations. In addition, our compensation expense will increase due to the new stock benefit plans we intend to implement. Our results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions, particularly changes in interest rates, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the on-going economic slowdown, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Future changes in applicable law, regulations or government policies may materially impact our financial condition and results of operations.
Business Strategy
Our business strategy is focused on transforming St. Landry Homestead into a more dynamic institution by embracing a relationship-oriented community bank model targeting small- to mid-sized businesses and business professionals in our market areas while continuing to serve our traditional customer base. Highlights of our business strategy, which is designed to facilitate our ability to operate and grow as a profitable community-based banking institution, include the following:
● Growing the loan portfolio with greater diversification. Our primary lending focus has been the origination of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2021, $87.3 million, or 66.2% of our loan portfolio, was secured by single-family residential mortgage loans. We believe that increased commercial lending offers an opportunity to enhance our profitability and our growth prospects. We intend to increase our commercial lending activities, particularly with respect to commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans and multi-family residential real estate loans. We plan to emphasize building full-service banking relationships with small- to mid-sized businesses and business professionals in our market area. We anticipate that our commercial real estate lending originations will focus on loans ranging in size from $500,000 to $2.0 million and that the focus of our commercial and industrial lending originations will be on loans ranging in size from $100,000 to $500,000.
● Grow our franchise organically through enhanced banking products and services. We have implemented a strategy of prudent growth. We believe we have an opportunity to grow organically by focusing on building relationships with small- to mid-sized businesses and business professionals in our market area and by enhancing the products and services we offer. We expect to increase our commercial loan originations while building strong relationships with an increased base of small- to mid-sized business and professional banking customers. To accomplish our goal, we are reviewing policies and procedures to facilitate our abilities to compete for new business customers. We will continue to enhance our staff capacity through training and hiring of new employees as needed to facilitate our growth. In addition, we continue to review our technology and infrastructure and will implement new and enhanced technology tools and on-line services preferred by many of our existing and prospective customers.
● Recruiting and retaining top talent and personnel. Mr. Zanco was hired as our new President and Chief Executive Officer in August 2020. Since then, we have made several additional new hires, including but not limited to: a Chief Credit Officer, a Director of Operations, an Acadiana Market President, a Chief Financial Officer and three commercial bankers. Recruiting and retaining talented individuals to guide us through the implementation of our business strategy will be critical to our success. While we believe we have assembled a strong management team, we will continue assessing our personnel needs and expect to add new bankers and management staff in order to complement the group that we have assembled. Our mutual-to-stock Conversion was critical to our efforts to attract and retain talent as is the adoption and implementation of employee stock benefit plans, consistent with federal banking regulations, which is anticipated to occur during the second quarter of 2022.
● Expand our franchise through de novo branching and possible acquisition of other financial institutions. We opened an additional office in Opelousas, Louisiana in July 2019, and expanded our branch network into Lafayette Parish in October 2020 with the opening of our Carencro office. Our newest branch office opened in Lafayette in November 2021. In addition, we believe there will be opportunities for expansion through acquisitions of other financial institutions in our current market area and adjoining markets in south Louisiana.
● Rebranding our banking franchise. Once we have largely implemented our business strategy, we expect to rebrand St. Landry Homestead Federal Savings Bank. Such re-branding efforts may include a new name, a new marketing campaign, updated on-line and website materials and new signage and logos to capture and reflect the new focus of the bank.
● Manage credit risk to reduce our level of non-performing assets. We believe that strong asset quality is a key to long-term financial success. Our strategy for credit risk management focuses on an experienced team of credit professionals, well-defined credit policies and procedures, appropriate loan underwriting criteria and active credit monitoring. Our ratio of non-performing assets to total assets was 0.43% at December 31, 2021.
Critical Accounting Estimates
In reviewing and understanding financial information for the Company, you are encouraged to read and understand the significant accounting policies used in preparing our financial statements. These policies are described in Note 1 of the notes to our financial statements. Our accounting and financial reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and to general practices within the banking industry. Accordingly, the financial statements require certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions, which are believed to be reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods presented. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an emerging growth company we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
The following accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These policies require numerous estimates or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or may be subject to variations which may significantly affect our reported results and financial condition for the period or in future periods.
Allowance for Loan Losses. We have identified the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses as a critical accounting policy where amounts are sensitive to material variation. The allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate for probable losses that are inherent in our loan portfolio but which have not yet been realized as of the date of our balance sheet. It is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loans, or portions of loans, are charged off against the allowance in the period that such loans, or portions thereof, are deemed uncollectible. Subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance. The allowance is an amount that management believes will cover probable and reasonably estimable losses in the loan portfolio based on evaluations of the collectability of loans. The evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the types and amount of loans in the loan portfolio, historical loss experience, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, estimated losses relating to specifically identified loans, and current economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including, among others, exposure at default, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impacted loans, value of collateral, estimated losses on our commercial and residential loan portfolios and general amounts for historical loss experience. All of these estimates may be susceptible to significant changes as more information becomes available. The allowance for loans losses totaled $2.3 million, or 1.73% of total loans, at December 31, 2021 and $3.0 million, or 1.99% of total loans, at December 31, 2020. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses primarily related to improvements in our assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our borrowers.
While management uses the best information available to make loan loss allowance evaluations, adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions or changes in accounting guidance. Historically, our estimates of the allowance for loan loss have not required significant adjustments from management’s initial estimates. In addition, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as an integral part of their examination processes periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses. While management is responsible for the establishment of the allowance for loan losses and for adjusting such allowance through provisions for loan losses, management may determine, as a result of such regulatory reviews, that an increase or decrease in the allowance or provision for loan losses may be necessary or that loan charge-offs are needed. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from management’s estimates, additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods.
Investment Securities. Available-for-sale securities consist of investment securities not classified as trading securities or held-to-maturity securities. Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value and unrealized holding gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale securities are included in other comprehensive income. The fair market values of investment securities are obtained from a third party service provider, whose prices are based on a combination of observed market prices for identical or similar instruments and various matrix pricing programs. The fair market values of investment securities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment at least quarterly, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. The term “other-than-temporary” is not intended to indicate a permanent decline in value. Rather, it means that the prospects for near term recovery of value are not necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support fair values equal to, or greater than, the carrying value of the investment. Declines in the estimated fair value of individual investment securities below their cost that are considered other-than-temporary are recognized as realized losses in the statement of income. Factors affecting the determination of whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred include, among other things, (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, (3) that the Company does not intend to sell these securities, and (4) it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell before a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale securities are included in other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2021, net unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities totaled $864,000, compared to net unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities of $134,000 at December 31, 2020. The increase in unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities relate principally to the change in interest rates for similar types of securities. No declines in fair value of available-for-sale securities during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were deemed to be other-than-temporary.
Income Taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the tax effects of the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the various assets and liabilities and gives current recognition to changes in tax rates and laws. Realizing our deferred tax assets principally depends upon our achieving projected future taxable income. We may change our judgments regarding future profitability due to future market conditions and other factors. We may adjust our deferred tax asset balances if our judgments change.
COVID-19
In light of the recent events surrounding the COVID-19 epidemic, the Company is continually assessing the effects of the pandemic on its employees, customers and communities. The CARES Act, enacted in March of 2020, contains many provisions related to banking, lending, mortgage forbearance and taxation. We have supported our customers through the Small Business Administration’s (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), loan modifications and loan deferrals. We have funded 240 SBA PPP loans totaling approximately $8.5 million with an average loan balance of $36,000 to existing customers and key prospects located primarily in our markets in south central Louisiana. In addition, we have granted loan modifications under the CARES Act, generally in the form of three-month deferrals of principal payments and a three-month extension of the maturity date. The Company handles loan modification requests on a case-by-case basis considering the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the related economic slowdown and stay-at-home orders on our customers and their current and projected cash flows through the terms of their respective loans. We believe the customer interaction during this time provides us with an opportunity to broaden and deepen our customer relationships while benefiting the local communities we serve. Through December 31, 2021, we granted COVID-19 related payment relief to 204 loans with principal balances totaling $28.2 million. As of December 31, 2021, we had no loans under deferral or extension agreements due to COVID-19.
The Company is working with customers affected by COVID-19 through modifications of their loans. In accordance with guidance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”), borrowers who were current prior to becoming affected by COVID-19, that received loan modifications as a result of the pandemic, generally are not reported as past due. Effects of COVID-19 may negatively impact management assumptions and estimates, such as the allowance for loan losses. The Company is evaluating all loan modifications to customers to identify and quantify any impact they may have on the Company. However, it is difficult to assess or predict how and to what extent COVID-19 will affect the Company in the future.

Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020
Total Assets. Total assets increased $60.7 million, or 27.0%, to $285.3 million at December 31, 2021 from $224.7 million at December 31, 2020. The increase resulted primarily from a $63.6 million increase in investment securities and a $15.6 million increase in cash and cash equivalents, offset in part by a decrease of $20.0 million in loans receivable.
Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $15.6 million, or 61.9%, to $40.9 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $25.2 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in cash and cash equivalents reflects a portion of the cash subscriptions received in our initial public offering which had not been invested at December 31, 2021, cash inflows of $19.7 million primarily due to the net decrease in loans in the year ended December 31, 2021, as well as deposit inflows associated with government stimulus payments received by our customers and SBA PPP loans originated during the year. The level of loan principal repayments during the year ended December 31, 2021, reflects in part the continuing effect of the historically low market rates of interest on residential mortgage loans and increased repayments by our mortgage loan customers who have re-financed their loans with other institutions.
Loans. Total loans receivable decreased by $20.0 million, or 13.1%, to $131.8 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $151.8 million at December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our total real estate loan portfolio decreased by $21.5 million, due primarily to a $12.6 million decrease in one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, a $7.2 million decrease in commercial real estate loans and a $1.5 million decrease in construction and land loans. Our total commercial and industrial loans increased by $1.6 million to $8.4 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $6.7 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in commercial and industrial loans during the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily reflects organic growth unrelated to SBA PPP loans. SBA PPP loans amounted to $2.6 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $3.5 million at December 31, 2020.
Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loans losses totaled $2.3 million, or 1.73% of total loans, at December 31, 2021 and $3.0 million, or 1.99% of total loans, at December 31, 2020. The Company recorded a reversal to the allowance for loan losses of $660,000 through earnings during the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to improvements in our assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our borrowers.
Investment Securities. Our total investment securities, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity, amounted to $101.8 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of $63.6 million, or 166.2%, compared to $38.3 million in investment securities at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021, $88.3 million, or 86.7%, of our total investment securities were classified as available-for-sale. Our investment securities portfolio at such date consisted primarily of debt obligations issued by the U.S. government and government agencies and government sponsored mortgage-backed securities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, purchases of $77.5 million of investment securities exceeded $8.6 million of maturities, calls and principal repayments.
Deposits. Our total deposits amounted to $176.8 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of $12.2 million, or 7.4%, compared to December 31, 2020. The increase in total deposits at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 reflects in part government stimulus payments received by our banking customers as well as depository inflows related to SBA PPP loan proceeds.
Borrowings. Our borrowings, which consist of FHLB advances, amounted to $9.0 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $8.8 million at December 31, 2020. The $180,000 increase in the carrying value of our FHLB advances primarily reflects the amortization of deferred prepayment penalties on $10.0 million in advances restructured in December of 2020. In December of 2020, a total of $15.0 million of long-term FHLB advances were paid off, with resulting prepayment penalties of $1.5 million being charged to earnings. The remaining $10.0 million of long-term debt was restructured to longer maturities at then current interest rates. An additional prepayment penalty for the restructuring of $1.2 million was treated as a discount on the debt.
Shareholders’ Equity. Shareholders’ equity increased $47.8 million to $98.3 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $50.5 million at December 31, 2020. The primary reason for the increase in total shareholders’ equity was the $50.8 million in net proceeds received from our Conversion and initial public offering of our Common Stock, which was completed in October 2021, and net income of $1.9 million for the year, which was partially offset by an increase in unallocated common
stock of $4.2 million due to the purchase of stock by the ESOP and a $790,000 decrease in accumulated unrealized gains/losses on available for sale securities. At December 31, 2021, our ratio of total shareholders’ equity to total assets was 34.5% compared to 22.5% at December 31, 2020.
Average Balances, Net Interest Income, and Yields Earned and Rates Paid. The following table shows for the periods indicated the total dollar amount of interest from average interest-earning assets and the resulting yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, expressed both in dollars and rates, and the net interest margin. All average balances are based on daily balances.
(1) Includes non-accrual loans during the respective periods. Calculated net of deferred fees and discounts and loans in process.
(2) Equals net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.
Rate/Volume Analysis. The following table shows the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities affected our interest income and expense during the periods indicated. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (1) changes in rate, which is the change in rate multiplied by prior year volume, and (2) changes in volume, which is the change in volume multiplied by prior year rate. The combined effect of changes in both rate and volume has been allocated proportionately to the change due to rate and the change due to volume.
Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
General. For the year ended December 31, 2021, net income totaled $1.9 million, an increase of $2.6 million compared to a net loss of $703,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. During 2021, net income included the recognition of $1.8 million in non-interest income related to a CDFI Rapid Response Program grant received in 2021 and a reversal of the allowance for loan losses of $660,000. During 2020, net income included $1.5 million in penalties as non-interest expense upon the prepayment of $15.0 million of FHLB advances and a $985,000 provision for loan losses.
Interest Income. Total interest income decreased $791,000, or 9.3%, to $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest income on loans decreased by $862,000, or 11.0%, in 2021. The average balance of our loan portfolio decreased by $19.6 million, or 12.2%, which was partially offset by an increase of six basis points (100 basis points being equal to 1.0%) in the average yield earned on loans in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest income earned on our investment securities portfolio increased by $106,000, or 18.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in 2021 was due primarily to a $23.2 million, or 66.8%, increase in the average balance during the year, which was partially offset by a 47 basis point reduction in the average yield earned on our investment securities. The average yield earned on our investment securities portfolio was 1.17% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 1.64% for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily reflecting the continuing historically low market rates of interest during the period. Interest income on other interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalent deposits at other financial institutions and other equity investments, decreased by $35,000, or 36.8%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The average yield earned on our other interest-earning assets decreased by 23 basis points to 0.16% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 0.39% for the year ended December 31, 2020, which more than offset the effects of an $13.9 million increase in the average balance of other interest-earning assets.
Interest Expense. Total interest expense decreased $910,000, or 53.4%, to $795,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest expense on FHLB advances decreased $513,000, or 65.4%, to $272,000 for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to a $15.5 million decrease in the average
balance of FHLB advances during the year. In December of 2020, a total of $15.0 million of long-term FHLB advances were paid off, with resulting prepayment penalties of $1.5 million being charged to non-interest expense. The remaining $10.0 million of long-term FHLB advances were restructured to longer maturities at then current interest rates. An additional prepayment penalty for the restructuring of $1.2 million was treated as a discount on the borrowings and is being amortized into interest expense over the life of the restructured borrowings. Interest expense on total deposits decreased $397,000, or 43.2%, to $523,000 for 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to a decrease of 34 basis points in the average rate paid on total deposits in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, which more than offset the effects of a $14.6 million increase in the average balance of total deposits during the period.
Net Interest Income. Net interest income totaled $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $119,000, or 1.8%, compared to $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our interest rate spread decreased to 2.73% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 2.77% for the year ended December 31, 2020, and our net interest margin decreased to 2.91% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 3.09% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decreases in interest rate spread and net interest margin were primarily the result of the continuing low interest rate environment and a shift in the mix of our interest-earning assets as we grew our investment securities portfolio and experienced a decline in total loans during 2021. These factors reduced average yield earned on total interest-earning assets in an amount which more than offset the reduction in the average cost of our interest-bearing liabilities.
Provision for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings as losses related to our loan portfolio are determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. Loans, or portions of loans, are charged off against the allowance in the period that such loans, or portions thereof, are deemed uncollectible. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.
The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management’s periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of the underlying collateral, and prevailing economic conditions. The evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.
We recorded a reversal for loan losses of $660,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a $985,000 provision for the year ended December 31, 2020. During 2020, our evaluation of the allowance for loan losses was significantly influenced by the uncertainty and economic disruption brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the increases of $872,000 and $529,000, respectively, on the amounts of our impaired loans and substandard loans at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. During 2021, our analysis reflected improvements in our assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our borrowers, improvements in the level of impaired and substandard loans and a decline in the size of our loan portfolio.
The establishment of the allowance for loan losses is significantly affected by management judgment and uncertainties and there is a likelihood that different amounts would be reported under different conditions or assumptions. Various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. While management is responsible for the establishment of the allowance for loan losses and for adjusting such allowance through provisions for loan losses, management may determine, as a result of such regulatory reviews, that an increase or decrease in the allowance or provision for loan losses may be necessary or that loan charge-offs are needed.
Non-interest Income. Non-interest income increased $1.7 million to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $966,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in non-interest income in 2021 was due primarily to the recognition into income of the $1.8 million CDFI grant.
Non-interest Expense. Non-interest expense decreased $167,000, or 2.1%, to $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. In December of 2020, a total of $15.0 million of long-term FHLB advances were paid off, with resulting prepayment penalties of $1.5 million being charged to non-interest expense in 2020. The decrease in non-interest expense due to the absence of prepayment penalties in 2021 was partially offset by increases in compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing and
communication and professional services expenses. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased by $987,000, or 27.1%, to $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to additional personnel employed and the commencement of the ESOP during 2021. Occupancy and equipment expense increased by $140,000, or 20.6%, to $818,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $678,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to expenses related to new branch locations opened in October 2020 and November 2021. Data processing and communication expense increased by $178,000, or 29.1%, to $790,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $612,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the cost of technology resources for new branch locations, additional personnel and improvements in software applications for financial reporting.
We expect non-interest expense to increase into 2022 because of certain costs associated with operating as a public company, including the Louisiana shares tax, the full-year impact of ESOP compensation expense and the possible implementation of stock-based benefit plans, if approved by our shareholders. We also expect to incur increased non-interest expense due to the planned re-branding of St. Landry Homestead. Such re-branding efforts may include a new name, a new marketing campaign, updated on-line and website materials and new signage and logos to capture and reflect the new focus of the Company.
Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense totaled $487,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to an income tax benefit of $474,000 in the prior year. The change in income tax expense was primarily due to the increase in taxable earnings in 2021 compared to 2020 and the absence of an income tax benefit from a net operating loss (“NOL”) carryback in 2021. During 2020, an income tax benefit of $196,000 was recognized due to a NOL carryback.
Exposure to Changes in Interest Rates
Our ability to maintain net interest income depends upon our ability to earn a higher yield on interest-earning assets than the rates we pay on deposits and borrowings. Our interest-earning assets consist primarily of fixed-rate investment securities and adjustable rate residential and commercial mortgage loans. Consequently, our ability to maintain a positive spread between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings can be adversely affected when market rates of interest change.
Economic Value of Equity. Interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of models which generate estimates of the change in our economic value of equity over a range of interest rate scenarios. Economic value of equity (“EVE”) represents the market value of portfolio equity, which is different from book value, and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities (that is, the difference between incoming and outgoing discounted cash flows of assets and liabilities) with adjustments made for off-balance sheet items. The EVE ratio, under any interest rate scenario, is defined as the EVE in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario. The following table sets forth our EVE as of December 31, 2021 and reflects the changes to EVE as a result of immediate and sustained changes in interest rates as indicated.
Net Interest Income Analysis. In addition to modeling changes in the economic value of equity, we also analyze potential changes to net interest income for a twelve-month period under rising and falling interest rate scenarios. The following table shows our net interest income model as of December 31, 2021.
The above table indicates that as of December 31, 2021, in the event of an immediate and sustained 300 basis point increase in interest rates, our net interest income for the 12 months ending December 31, 2022 would be expected to increase by $329,000 or 4.9%.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company maintains levels of liquid assets deemed adequate by management. We adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows, repay our borrowings, and to fund loan commitments. We also adjust liquidity, as appropriate, to meet asset and liability management objectives.
Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and proceeds from maturities of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the FHLB. At December 31, 2021, we had outstanding advances from the FHLB with a carrying value of $9.0 million, and had the capacity to borrow approximately an additional $50.5 million from the FHLB and an additional $17.8 million on a line of credit with First National Bankers Bank at such date.
While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period.
Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.4 million and $857,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of net change in loans receivable and net change in investment securities, was $46.6 million and $313,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities, consisting primarily of proceeds from the issuance of stock, the activity in deposit accounts and FHLB advances, was $58.8 million and $6.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained. We also anticipate continued use of FHLB advances.
The Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and was categorized as well-capitalized at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Management is not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent notification that would change our category. The following table presents actual and required capital ratios for the Bank.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. At December 31, 2021, we had $1.1 million of remaining funds to be disbursed on construction loans in process and $4.9 million of outstanding commitments to originate loans. Our total letters and lines of credit, unused overdraft privilege amounts and unused lines of credit totaled $3.8 million at December 31, 2021. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2021, totaled $50.0 million at December 31, 2021. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize FHLB advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense.
Commitments. The following table summarizes our outstanding commitments to originate loans and to advance additional amounts pursuant to outstanding letters of credit, lines of credit and undisbursed construction loans at December 31, 2021.
