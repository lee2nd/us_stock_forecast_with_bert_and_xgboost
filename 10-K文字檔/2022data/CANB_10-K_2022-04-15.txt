Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2021 compared with Year Ended December 31, 2020:
Revenues increased $2,894,160 from $1,709,669 in 2020 to $4,603,829 in 2021. The increase is due to the wind down of restrictions related to the Covid-19 Pandemic surrounding elective surgeries, enabling an increase in the usage of the Company’s Duramed product lines and ultrasound device associated with patient recovery. Additionally, due to asset acquisitions in 2021, the Company’s Music City Botanical and Botanical Biotech brands related to an increase of sales compared to 2020 of $1,709,669. Cost of product sales increased $1,333,668 from $278,062 in 2020 to $1,611,730 in 2021 in conjunction with the increase in revenue and production in 2021.

Other operating expenses increased $576,036 from $876,431 in 2020 to $1,452,467 in 2021.

Net loss increased $3,290,491 from $8,878,904 in 2020 to $12,169,395 in 2021. The increase was due to all factors discussed above and in addition an increase of $1,167,510 in interest expense.

Cash and cash equivalents decreased $8,797 from $457,798 at December 31, 2020 to $449,001 at December 31, 2021.

The Company currently has no agreements, arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources.
We currently have no commitments with any person for any capital expenditures.
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. It is anticipated that Green Grow will again begin operations later in 2022 as Pure Health Products revenue increases and the need for additional isolate is present. Today, the available oversupply of isolate makes it cheaper to buy quality product at the market than to grow, harvest, and extract from scratch. Duramed, Inc. is beginning to show improvements in office utilization of its ultrasound device as more surgery centers are reopening.
