Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Overview
Applied UV is focused on the development and acquisition of technology that addresses infection control in the healthcare, hospitality, commercial and municipal markets. The Company has two wholly owned subsidiaries - SteriLumen, Inc. (“SteriLumen”) and MunnWorks, LLC (“MunnWorks”).
SteriLumen’s connected platform for Data Driven Disinfection™ applies the power of ultraviolet light (UVC) to destroy pathogens safely, thoroughly, and automatically, addressing the challenge of healthcare-acquired infections ("HAIs"). Targeted for use in facilities that have high customer turnover such as hospitals, hotels, commercial facilities, and other public spaces, the Company’s Lumicide™ platform uses UVC LEDs in several patented designs for infection control in and around high-traffic areas, including sinks and restrooms, killing bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens residing on hard surfaces within the devices’ proximity. The Company’s patented in-drain disinfection device, Lumicide Drain, is the only product on the market that addresses this critical pathogen-intensive location.
SteriLumen’s Airocide® air purification devices are research backed, clinically proven and developed for NASA with assistance from the University of Wisconsin. Airocide® is listed as an FDA Class II Medical device, utilizes a proprietary photocatalytic (PCO) bioconversion technology that draws air into a reaction chamber that converts damaging molds, microorganisms, dangerous airborne pathogens, destructive VOCs, allergens, odors and biological gasses into harmless water vapor and green carbon dioxide without producing ozone or other harmful byproducts. Airocide® applications include healthcare, hospitality, grocery chains, wine making facilities, commercial real estate, schools, dental offices, post-harvest, grocery, food processing, storage and transportation, cannabis facilities, and homes.
SteriLumen’s Scientific Air product was developed initially for healthcare facilities and is helping hospitals across the country address the growing need for effective and safe airborne infection prevention. Utilizing Scientific Air systems, hospitals report significant reductions in viable airborne pathogens as well as significant declines in non-viable particulates including elimination of odor and VOC's. Scientific Air products produce no harmful by-products, provide rapid, portable, whole-room disinfection via a patented 3-phase design, are safe and fast-acting in occupied spaces, and have been proven and tested in facilities with EPA and FDA guidance compliance.
According to Resource and Markets, the UV Disinfection market is expected to reach $8 billion by 2026 as technology continues to improve and the focus on stopping the spread of contagious diseases increases. The Center for Disease Control states that 1 in 25 patients have at least one Hospital Associated Infection (HAI) annually and that 3 million serious infections occur every year in long-term care facilities. Scientists globally have been advocating improving air quality post pandemic, significantly boosting global adoption to control airborne pathogen transmission. Governments globally mandating health agencies to address air quality via grants and mechanisms to ease visitation and protect facilities against future pathogens (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services - CMS February 2022 Long-term Care Initiative).

Indoor air quality has become an even more important issue as world economies start the recovery process. In 2021, 39 scientists reiterated the need for a "paradigm shift" and called for improvements in, "how we view and address the transmission of respiratory infections to protect against unnecessary suffering and economic losses."
In addition to this, the global air purifier market size is set to grow exponentially. It was valued at $9.24 billion in 2021 and is predicted to grow to approximately $22.84 billion by 2030. According to Precedence Research, the immense demand for air purification and sterilization in the US will be driven by the commercial sector.
SteriLumen’s product portfolio is one of the only research-backed, clinically proven pure-play air and surface disinfection technology companies with international distribution and globally recognized end users, with product developed for NASA. In addition to the numerous recognized research institutions and globally recognized names who published the reports that were completed by the acquired companies, Airocide was independently proven to kill SARS, MRSA and Anthrax, in addition to removing damaging molds, microorganisms, destructive VOC’s, allergens, odors, and biological gases. Also, SteriLumen’s air purification (Airocide) and surface disinfection (Lumicide) were independently tested and proven to kill both Candida Auris (Resinnova Laboratories) and SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) (MRIGlobal).
SteriLumen’s product portfolio is used by globally recognized names including; Walmart, Whole Foods, SuperValue, Delmonte, Esmeralda, Joel Gott Wines, Opus One, Athena Healthcare, NYC Health and Hospitals, Kaiser Permanente, Advent Health, University Rochester Medical Center and Baptist Health South Florida. This past year, the SteriLumen product portfolio expanded its reach and deployed its air purification products into Boston Red Sox Fenway Park and Jet Blue Park, The Palace Versaille , Uruguayan School Systems, Tennessee Department of Corrections, Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS), US Army Aberdeen Proving Grounds and Schools throughout South Korea.
The Company works with a global base of distributors to sell both SteriLumen air purification and disinfection products and the MunnWorks product lines. The past year, the Company has signed distribution agreements covering Africa (360BioPharma), US Healthcare (Axis), Lootah Batta Water and Environment Sign Exclusive Distribution Agreement for Airocide(R) Air Purification Systems for the United Arab Emirates, and Plandent a wholly owned subsidiary of Planmeca Oy (Scandinavia). SteriLumen plans to continue to expand its global distribution base of significant breadth and scale to introduce the entire SteriLumen’s air purification product lines to new markets, including building management, commercial real estate, retail, healthcare, cannabis and environmental health and safety, leveraging the networks of the recent acquisitions described above.
MunnWorks is a manufacturer of custom designed fine mirrors specifically for the hospitality industry with one manufacturing facility in Mount Vernon, New York. Our goal is to contribute to the creation of what our design industry clients seek: manufacturing better framed mirrors on budget and on time. As part of our long-term strategy, the Company has instituted multi-site production for high-value items, complicated designs and finishes. Our headquarters in Mount Vernon, NY serves as the center for multi-country manufacturing. The Company works with a satellite network of artisans and craftsmen, including gilders, carvers, and old-world finishers.
Acquisitions
In February of 2021, the Company acquired all the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Akida Holdings, LLC (“Akida”). At the time of the acquisition, Akida owned the Airocide™ system of air purification technologies, originally developed for NASA with assistance from the University of Wisconsin at Madison, that uses a combination of UVC and a proprietary, titanium dioxide based photocatalyst that may help to accelerate the reopening of the global economy with applications in the hospitality, hotel, healthcare, nursing homes, grocer, wine, commercial buildings and retail sectors. The Airocide™ system has been used by brands such as NASA, Whole Foods, Dole, Chiquita, Opus One, Sub-Zero Refrigerators and Robert Mondavi Wines. Akida had contracted KES Science & Technology, Inc. (“KES”) to manufacture, warehouse and distribute the Airocide™ system and Akida’s contractual relationship with KES was assigned to and assumed by the Company as part of the acquisition.

On September 28, 2021, the Company acquired all the assets and assumed certain liabilities of KES. At the time of the acquisition, KES was principally engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of the Airocide™ system of air purification technologies and misting systems. KES also had the exclusive right to the sale and distribution of the Airocide™ system in certain markets. This acquisition consolidates all of manufacturing, sale and distribution of the Airocide™ system under the SteriLumen brand and expands the Company’s market presence in food distribution, post-harvest produce, wineries, and retail sectors. The Company sells its products throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe.
On October 13, 2021, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Old SAM Partners, LLC F/K/A Scientific Air Management, LLC, which owned a line of air purification technologies (“Scientific Air’) for a purchase price of $9.5 million in cash and 200,000 fully vested shares of our Common Stock (the “Vested Shares”) and 200,000 shares of our Common Stock that are subject to vesting (the “Earnout Shares”) (the “Scientific Air Acquisition”). The number of shares of Common Stock included in the purchase price was based on a per share value of $10.00. Scientific Air is a provider of whole-room, aerosol chamber and laboratory certified air disinfection machines that use a combination of UVC and a proprietary, patented system to eliminate airborne bacteria, mold, fungi, viruses, volatile organic compounds, and many odors without producing any harmful by-products. The units are well suited for larger spaces within a facility and are mobile with industrial grade casters allowing for movement throughout a facility to address increased bio burdern from larger meetings or increased human traffic.

Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020
The Company utilizes Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to assist in anayzing our segment operating performance by removing the impact of certain key items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. In addition, we consider certain non-GAAP (or "adjusted") measures to be useful to management and investors evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented, and provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations, liquidity, and management of assets. This information can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital. These adjusted metrics are consistent with how management views our business and are used to make financial, operating and planning decisions. These metrics, however, are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for revenues, operating income, net income (loss), earnings (loss) per share (basic and diluted) or net cash from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Operating Profit (Loss), excluding Depreciation and Amortization, and excluding Stock Based Compensation. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of ($4,800,203) for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was an increase of ($2,192,454) as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. By segment, Hospitality improved $138,606, while Disinfection decreased ($1,391,486) and Corporate decreased ($939,574).

Segments
The Company has three reportable segments: the design, manufacture, assembly and distribution of disinfecting systems for use in healthcare, hospitality, and commercial municipal and residential markets (Disinfection segment); the manufacture of fine mirrors specifically for the Hospitality industry (hospitality segment); and the Corporate Segment, which includes expenses primarily related to corporate governance, such as board fees, legal expenses, audit fees, executive management, and listing costs. See NOTE 14 - Segment Reporting.
Net Sales
Net sales of $11,667,579 represented an increase of $5,934,845, or 103.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to net sales of $5,732,734 for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to the addition of the Disinfection segment in 2021 as a result of the strategic acquisitions of Akida, KES, and Scientific Air. The 2021 net sales for Disinfection of $5,723,915 includes close to 11 months of Akida-related sales (acquisition closed February 8, 2021), one quarter of KES-related sales (acquisition closed September 28, 2021), and just over 2 months of Scientific Air-related sales (acquisition closed October 13, 2021). The Hospitality segment began to rebound from the slowdown caused by the pandemic and finished the year ended December 31, 2021 with net sales of $5,943,664, which represented an increase of $210,930, or 3.7% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
Gross Profit
Gross profit increased $3,089,050, or 306%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, driven by both volume growth and the higher margin contribution from the Disinfection segment. The Disinfection segment’s gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $2,643,374, or 46.2% as a percentage of net sales. The Hospitality segment’s gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1,455.012, or 24.4% as a percentage of net sales, as compared to $1,009,336, or 17.6% as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Hospitality segment’s gross profit was impacted last year by the sales slowdown caused by the pandemic, as well as higher overhead cost absorption as the company kept many of their direct labor employees in compliance with the payroll protection program forgiveness requirements. The company is focused on realizing cost synergies from consolidation and streamlining of manufacturing operations to help offset increases in material and logistics costs.
Operating Expenses
Selling, General, and Administrative - S,G&A costs, excluding stock compensation expense of $1,549,787 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $687,505 for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $9,791,925 for the year ended December 31, 2021, which represented an increase of $6,467,874 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was driven primarily by the expansion of the Disinfection segment. The infrastructure to support this segment was initially implemented in the fourth quarter of 2020, and additional investments were made during 2021 to support the three strategic acquisitions of Akida, KES, and Scientific Air. Payroll costs increased $2.4 million year over year as headcount increased from 33 at December 31, 2020 to 61 at December 31, 2021. Consulting costs increased $0.7 million and legal expense increased $0.4 million, mainly due to acquisition-related expenses. Amortization expense, mostly related to the intangible assets associated with the acquisitions, increased $1.0 million, and depreciation expense increased $0.1 million. Additional increases were due to advertising $0.3 million, product certification and testing $0.3m, insurance $0.2million, and rent $0.1 million. We anticipate efficiency gains in the coming year as we fully integrate all 3 acquisitions and leverage synergies where practical. The Corporate segment includes expenses primarily related to corporate governace, such as board fees, legal expenses, audit fees, executive management, and listing costs, allowing for a better reflection of operational measurement of each of the two operating segments.

Stock based compensation - Stock based compensation was $1,549,787 for the year ended December 31, 2021, which represented and increase of $862,282 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the full year impact of awards that were granted in the foruth quarter of 2020, and additional awards made during 2021, under the Applied UV, Inc. 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) which authorized 600,000 shares of common stock to be available for issuance under the terms of the Plan. The Plan permits the granting of Nonqualified Stock Options, Incentive Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares, Performance Units and Other Awards. The expense increase is also due to a new employment contract for Max Munn, now Interim CEO, that became effective in Q1 of 2021, whose options were not part of the Plan. Mr.Munn received options to purchase 309,835 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $7.80 per share. These options vest at the end of each month for 36 months beginning April 1, 2021, which resulted in an expense of $391,863 for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Other
The Company recorded income on the change in fair value of warrant liability in the amount of $66,862 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Warrants that were issued in connection with the November 2020 public offering contained a cash settlement feature which resulted in a warrant liability of $68,263 as of December 31, 2021. The fair market value of the warrant liability on the date of grant was $135,125 and was recorded as a reduction of Additional Paid in Capital.
The company recorded a loss on contingent consideration of $574,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of the decrease in our stock price from the date of acquisition of SciAir and the reporting date.
Other Income includes the payroll protection program loan forgiveness of $296,827.
Net Benefit from Income Taxes of $91,819 is due to a loss carryback that was generated in the tax year ended December 31, 2020.
Net Loss
We recorded a net loss of $7,390,355 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a net loss of $3,368,810 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $3,807,244 in the net loss was mainly due to the investments made to grow the Disinfection segment and loss on contingent consideration, offset by the increased revenue and gross margin from that segment, as discussed above, plus an increase in corporate governance costs.
