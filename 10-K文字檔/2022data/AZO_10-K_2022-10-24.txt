For fiscal 2022, we achieved record net income of $2.4 billion, an 11.9% increase over the prior year, and sales growth of $1.6 billion, an 11.1% increase over the prior year. Domestic commercial sales increased 26.5%, which represents 28.8% of our domestic auto parts sales. Both our retail sales and commercial sales grew this past year as we made progress on our initiatives aimed at improving our ability to say “Yes” to our customers more frequently and accelerating our commercial growth.Error!

Our business is impacted by various factors within the economy that affect both our consumer and our industry, including but not limited to inflation, fuel costs, wage rates, supply chain disruptions, hiring and other economic conditions. Given the nature of these macroeconomic factors, we cannot predict whether or for how long certain trends will continue, nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future.‌Error!
