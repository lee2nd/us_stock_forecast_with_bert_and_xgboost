COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) as a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the U.S. COVID-19 is having an unprecedented impact on the U.S economy as federal, state, and local governments react to this public health crisis.
The impacts of the current COVID-19 pandemic are broad reaching and have impacted the Company’s licensing royalty interests. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, there is significant uncertainty surrounding the potential impact on the Company’s future results of operations and cash flows and its ability to raise capital. While we believe we are well positioned in the marketplace to navigate difficult market conditions in times of economic uncertainty, we believe continued impacts of the pandemic could materially adversely affect our Company’s near-term and long-term revenues, earnings, liquidity, and cash flows as the Company’s customers and /or licensees may request temporary relief, delay or not make scheduled payments on their royalty commitments.
Background Overview
We are engaged in the business of acquiring, holding and managing royalty interests derived from Internet based businesses. Royalty interests are passive (non-operating) agreements that provide us with contractual rights to revenue produced from our operators. The revenue generated by our operators is typically from physical or digital product sales, subscriptions and advertising.
Our purchase of royalty interests enables entrepreneurs to raise non-dilutive capital and retain control of their businesses. When we enter into royalty interest agreements, our primary objectives are to generate revenue streams from our operators and increase our corporate cash flow. In some cases, we may also generate a premium on our original purchase price if a royalty interest is redeemed by an operator or third-party such as a buyer of an operator. We plan to acquire royalty interests that can generate a 15% to 30% internal rate of return, although there can be no guarantee that we will achieve this target.
Royalty interests are purchased for a fixed amount of capital in exchange for pre-determined royalty payments. Depending on the unique agreement, (i) royalty payments can be made monthly, quarterly or annually, (ii) royalty payments can be made in perpetuity or for a limited amount of time, (iii) royalty payment calculations can change during the term of the royalty interest agreement based on certain performance metrics or time and (iv) royalty payments can be calculated off gross revenue of each operator, or off net-revenue, which accounts for certain defined adjustments to gross revenue, or off unit sales. Although we presently do not have a plan in place to do so now, we may issue shares of our Company common stock to operators, in addition to the payment of cash, in exchange for royalty payments from the operator.
We primarily intend to negotiate royalty interests directly from operators, but we may also acquire existing royalty interests from third parties. A key element of our business model is the building of a diversified portfolio of high-quality royalty interests from Internet based businesses.
We use a series of quantitative, qualitative, financial, and legal criteria by which we evaluate the potential acquisition of royalty interests. We plan to acquire assets with an income focus, and our target is to acquire assets generating uncorrelated income of 15% to 30% internal rate of return, although there can be no guarantee that we will achieve this target. Among the factors considered are: (1) the business track record of revenue and earnings; (2) the type of business that generates royalties; (3) the experience and skill of the active management team of the business; (4) our assessment of the longevity and staying power of the underlying business; and (5) the potential for revenue growth and capital appreciation.
We currently, and generally at any time, have royalty interest acquisition opportunities in various stages of active review. At this time, we cannot provide assurance that any of the possible transactions under review by us will be concluded successfully.

Results of Operations
Fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 compared to fiscal year ending October 31, 2020
Revenues
We recognized $66,226 and $102,081 in revenue related to royalty agreements we have with our operators for the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020. The decrease in revenue is related to one operator going out of business and a slower start to revenue generating activities of Artist Holdings, LLC and RhymeMakers, LLC.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses of $358,762 during the year ended October 31, 2021 decreased from $415,316 for the year ended October 31, 2020. The primary reasons for the decrease were from decrease in consulting expense of $45,000, decrease in advertising expense of $9,397 offset by increase in dues and subscription of $14,104.
We expect our operating expenses to increase in 2021-2022 as a result of increased operating activity to implement our business plan.
Other Income (expenses)
We generated other income of $122,401 and $14,061 for the year ended October 31, 2021 and 2020. The increase is primarily related to funds received from a former service provider to settle a dispute on billing of $105,000.
We incurred $161,000 and $184,708 in impairment expense for the year ended October 31, 2021 and 2020. In 2021, we impaired our Pick-A-Toilet royalty due to the absence of revenue and in 2020 we impaired the Offito royalty because they went out of business.
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) as a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the U.S. COVID-19 is having an unprecedented impact on the U.S economy as federal, state, and local governments react to this public health crisis.
The Company received a PPP loan of $11,300 that was forgiven in 2021 and included in other income. The Company received two economic injury disaster loan (“EIDL”) grants in the amount of $1,500 and $5,000 that were included in other income during the year ended October 31, 2020.
Net Loss
We recorded a net loss of $331,135 and $483,880 for the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020 respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At October 31, 2021 and 2020, we had total current assets of $790,027 and $1,051,787, respectively, consisting primarily of cash and prepaid expenses. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021, the Company invested $150,014 in cryptocurrencies. We had total current liabilities of $16,794 and $26,474, consisting of general accounts payable, resulting in a net working capital position of $773,233 and $1,025,313, respectively.
Analysis of Cash Flows
For the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company used $131,593 and $234,677 in operating activities, made up primarily of the net loss of $331,135 and $483,880, offset by the amortization of royalty interests of $54,355 and $54,792, and the impairment of royalty interests of $161,000 and $184,708, respectively.
Sources and Uses of Cash
For the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company invested $125,000 and $430,000 in the acquisition of royalty interests, respectively.
The Company allocated $150,014 to cryptocurrencies for the year ended October 31, 2021.
For the year ended October 31, 2020, the Company raised $520,300 in financing of which $509,000 was received through the private placement offering of 848.34 units. The units were sold at the price of $600 per unit. Each unit consisted of 300 shares of Company common stock, $0.01 per share and a warrant to purchase an additional 300 shares of Company common stock at an exercise price equal to $2.67 per share. Other financing proceeds of $11,300 came from the Paycheck Protection Program. See Note 5- Notes Payable in the notes to the audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. We believe that our existing cash on hand and additional cash generated from operations will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our operating needs for the next 12 months, as our projected operating expenses will be approximately $400,000 over the next 12 months.
At October 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no non-cancellable lease obligations and we had no other off-balance sheet arrangements, commitments or guarantees that require additional disclosure or measurement.
We expect that our cash used in operations will continue to increase during 2022 and beyond as a result of the following planned activities: increased advertising and the build-up of our permanent staffing.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our critical accounting policies and estimates, including the assumptions and judgments underlying them, are disclosed in the Notes to the Financial Statements. We have consistently applied these policies in all material respects. We do not believe that our operations to date have involved uncertainty of accounting treatment, subjective judgment, or estimates, to any significant degree, except as noted below and it is unlikely that material different amounts would be reported under different assumptions.
Royalty Interests
We have a total of $675,675 invested in royalty interests. Royalty interests are passive (non-operating) agreements that provide us with contractual rights to a percentage of revenue produced from companies we provide funds to. We adopted the policy of amortizing the cost of royalty interests using the straight-line method over a period of 15 years. Royalty interests are considered a long-lived asset that is required to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In accordance with ASC 360-10, impairment exists for the royalty interests if the carrying amount exceeds the estimates of future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such assets. An impairment charge is required to be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset, or asset group, exceeds its fair value.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue under royalty interest agreements when earned and collection is reasonably assured.
We recognized revenue from royalty interest agreements under ASC 606-10-55-65 which apply to sales-based or Usage-Based royalties. Guidance under this section stipulates that revenue recognition should be based when the later of the following events occur: (1) the subsequent sales occur or (2) the performance obligation to which some or all for the sales-based royalty has been allocated has been satisfied or partially satisfied. The Company deems collection efforts to be the key performance obligation being satisfied, and therefore has adopted the approach of recognizing revenue based on customer collections. The operators that are parties to the royalty agreements, are typically structured to report and pay percentages of revenue earned over a quarterly period, some of which do not line up with the quarterly reporting period of the Company.
Cryptocurrencies
The Company made investments in cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, during the year ended October 31, 2021 of $150,014. Such amounts are included in current assets in the accompanying balance sheets.
Cryptocurrencies held are accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, which is measured using the quoted price of the cryptocurrency at the time its fair value is being measured. In testing for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that an impairment exists, a quantitative impairment test is not necessary. If the Company concludes otherwise, it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test. To the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market may have an adverse affect on the fair value of assets held by the entity.
Contractual Obligations
SAFE Agreements
The Company had a Simple Agreement for Future Equity program ("SAFE"). The initial SAFE agreement was the first in a planned series of simple agreements for future equity (collectively, the "Series 1 SAFEs") issued by the Company to investors with identical terms and on the same form, except that the holder, purchase price and date of issuance may differ in each SAFE. Pursuant to the definitions of the Series 1 SAFEs, as amended, the price per share of the Next Equity Financing minus a discount of 45% will be the conversion price. The conversion price will be subject to a Valuation Cap of $15 million. As of October 31, 2019, SAFE convertible contributions amounted to $1,812,000.
During the period ended October 31, 2020, these SAFE agreements converted into 1,647,273 shares of common stock subscribed at the contractual discounted price of $1.10 per share. As of October 31, 2021, the shares have been considered issued to the shareholders.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
New Accounting Pronouncements
We do not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flow.
