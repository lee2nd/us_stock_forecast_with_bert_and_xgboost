Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis represents a review of the Corporation’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. This review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements beginning on page.
K-17
Overview
The Corporation reported consolidated net income available to common stockholders of $10.0 million, or $3.63 per diluted common share, for 2021, an increase of $3.4 million, or 52.0%, compared to $6.6 million, or $2.41 per diluted common share, for 2020. Net income available to common stockholders was impacted by the following:
•
Net interest income increased $2.4 million, or 8.2%, to $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $29.1 million for 2020. This increase primarily related to a decrease in interest expense of $2.9 million, or 36.4%, while interest income decreased $566,000, or 1.5%. Driving the decrease in interest expense was a 44 basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 0.69% for 2021 from 1.13% for 2020.
•
Provision for loan losses decreased $2.2 million, or 67.2%, to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $3.2 million for 2020. The higher provision for loan losses recorded in 2020 was due to growth in the residential and consumer loan portolios, the addition of a specific pandemic qualitative allowance factor, increased risk ratings for loans which were granted payment deferrals and an increase in criticized and classified loans. During 2021, the provision for loan losses decreased as criticized and classified loans decreased and the specific pandemic allowance qualitative factor was reduced.
•
Noninterest income increased $227,000, or 5.2%, to $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $4.4 million for 2020 due to increases in other noninterest income, gains on the sale of loans and earnings on bank-owned life insurance of $549,000, $149,000 and $34,000, respectively, partially offset by decreases in gains on the sale of securities and fees and service charges of $442,000 and $63,000, respectively.
•
Noninterest expense increased $578,000, or 2.6%, to $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $22.0 million for 2020. This increase was primarily related to increases in compensation and employee benefits, other noninterest expense, professional fees, FDIC insurance expense and intangible asset amortization expense of $192,000, $188,000, $176,000, $41,000 and $21,000, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in premises and equipment expense of $40,000.
Changes in Financial Condition
Total assets increased $27.2 million, or 2.6%, to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2021 from $1.0 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase in assets was driven primarily by a $73.2 million increase in securities, partially offset by decreases in cash and equivalents and net loans receivable of $28.4 million and $20.3 million. The decrease in net loans receivable was driven by a $29.2 million reduction in PPP loans to $1.2 million at December 31, 2021, from $30.4 million at December 31, 2020. Liabilities increased $21.7 million, or 2.3%, to $962.5 million at December 31, 2021 from $940.8 million at December 31, 2020 due to a $24.9 million increase in customer deposits, partially offset by a $10.0 million reduction in borrowed funds.
Cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $28.4 million, or 75.8%, to $9.1 million at December 31, 2021 from $37.4 million at December 31, 2020. Excess cash balances resulting from deposit inflows and the repayment of loans were utilized to fund security purchases and repay borrowed funds.
Interest earning time deposits. Interest earning time deposits decreased $3.2 million, or 56.6%, to $2.5 million at December 31, 2021 from $5.7 million at December 31, 2020. This decrease resulted from maturities of certificates of deposits with other financial institutions totaling $3.7 million, partially offset by purchases totaling $496,000 during the year.
Securities. Securities increased $73.2 million, or 64.8%, to $186.3 million at December 31, 2021 from $113.0 million at December 31, 2020. This increase primarily resulted from investment purchases of $105.1 million during the year, partially offset by security sales, maturities and repayments totaling $28.5 million.
Loans receivable. Net loans receivable decreased $20.3 million, or 2.5%, to $780.0 million at December 31, 2021 from $800.3 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease was driven by decreases in the Corporation’s residential mortgage, commercial business and home equity portfolios of $34.2 million, $23.3 million and $11.3 million, respectively, partially offset by increases in the commercial mortgage and consumer portfolios of $40.7 million and $8.5 million, respectively. Included in the decrease of the commercial business loan balances for 2021 was $29.2 million of loans forgiven under the SBA's PPP lending program.
K-18
Nonperforming assets. Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, loans 90 days past due and still accruing, repossessions and real estate owned. Nonperforming assets were $3.3 million, or 0.32% of total assets, at December 31, 2021 compared to $4.4 million, or 0.43% of total assets, at December 31, 2020. Nonperforming assets consisted of nonperforming loans of $3.3 million at December 31, 2021 and nonperforming loans of $4.1 million and other real estate owned of $344,000 at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021, nonperforming loans consisted primarily of commercial mortgage and residential mortgage loans.
Federal bank stocks. Federal bank stocks were comprised of FHLB stock and FRB stock of $3.9 million and $1.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021. These stocks are purchased and redeemed at par as directed by the federal banks and levels maintained are based primarily on borrowing and other correspondent relationships between the Corporation and the federal banks.
Bank-owned life insurance (BOLI). The Corporation maintains single premium life insurance policies on certain current and former officers and employees of the Bank. In addition to providing life insurance coverage, whereby the Bank as well as the officers and employees receive life insurance benefits, the appreciation of the cash surrender value of the BOLI will serve to offset and finance existing and future employee benefit costs. Increases in this account are typically associated with an increase in the cash surrender value of the policies, partially offset by certain administrative expenses. BOLI increased $6.4 million, or 41.6%, to $21.9 million at December 31, 2021 from $15.5 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in BOLI during the year was primarily due to the purchase of $6.0 million in additional policies.
Premises and equipment. Premises and equipment decreased $1.8 million to $16.4 million at December 31, 2021 from $18.2 million at December 31, 2020. The overall decrease in premises and equipment during the year was due to depreciation and amortization of $1.4 million and sales of $1.3 million, partially offset by purchases of $872,000. During 2021, the Corporation sold its Chester, West Virginia office building following the closure of that branch in April. In addition, the Corporation sold its building located in the Southside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and entered into a lease to continue operating the branch in that location.
Goodwill. Goodwill remained unchanged at $19.5 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Goodwill represents the excess of the total purchase price paid for the acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, net of the fair value of the liabilities assumed. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Management evaluated goodwill and concluded that no impairment existed during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Core deposit intangible. The core deposit intangible was $899,000 at December 31, 2021, compared to $1.1 million at December 31, 2020. The core deposit intangible includes amounts associated with the assumption of deposits in the 2018 Community First Bancorp, Inc. (CFB) acquisition, the 2017 Northern Hancock Bank and Trust Co. (NHB) acquisition and the 2016 United American Savings Bank (UASB) acquisition. This asset represents the long-term value of the core deposits acquired. In each instance, the fair value was determined using a third-party valuation expert specializing in estimating fair values of core deposit intangibles. The fair value was derived using an industry standard present value methodology. All-in costs and runoff balances by year were discounted by comparable term FHLB advance rates, used as an alternative cost of funds measure. This intangible asset amortizes over a weighted average estimated life of the related deposits. The core deposit intangible asset is not estimated to have a significant residual value. The Corporation recorded $185,000 and $164,000 of intangible amortization in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Deposits. Total deposits increased $24.9 million, or 2.8%, to $918.5 million at December 31, 2021 from $893.6 million at December 31, 2020. Non-interest bearing deposits increased $28.2 million, or 14.6%, and interest bearing demand deposits increased $33.4 million, or 6.6%. These increases were driven by increases in public funds and government stimulus deposits. The increase in demand deposits were partially offset by a $37.3 million, or 19.8%, decrease in time deposits due to the maturity of certificates of deposit.
Borrowed funds. Borrowed funds decreased $10.0 million, or 31.2%, to $22.1 million at December 31, 2021 from $32.1 million at December 31, 2020. Borrowed funds at December 31, 2021 consisted of short-term borrowings of $7.1 million and long-term borrowings of $15.0 million. Short-term borrowed funds at December 31, 2021 consisted of an outstanding balance of $2.1 million on a line of credit with a correspondent bank at rate of 4.25% and $5.0 million of FHLB overnight funds at a rate of 0.28%. Long-term borrowed funds consisted of three $5.0 million FHLB term advances totaling $15.0 million, maturing between 2023 and 2025 and having fixed interest rates between 1.65% and 2.79%. Long-term advances are utilized primarily to fund loan growth and short-term advances are utilized primarily to compensate for normal deposit fluctuations.
Stockholders’ equity. Stockholders’ equity increased $5.5 million, or 6.0%, to $97.0 million at December 31, 2021 from $91.5 million at December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to net income of $10.2 million, partially offset by a decrease of $1.7 million in accumulated other comprehensive income and common stock and preferred dividends paid of $3.3 million and $196,000, respectively.

Changes in Results of Operations
The Corporation reported net income before preferred stock dividends of $10.2 million and $6.7 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The following “Average Balance Sheet and Yield/Rate Analysis” and “Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income” tables should be utilized in conjunction with the discussion of the interest income and interest expense components of net interest income.
Average Balance Sheet and Yield/Rate Analysis. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information concerning the total dollar amounts of interest income from interest-earning assets and the resulting average yields, the total dollar amounts of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resulting average costs, net interest income, interest rate spread and the net interest margin earned on average interest-earning assets. For purposes of this table, average loan balances include nonaccrual loans and exclude the allowance for loan losses and interest income includes accretion of net deferred loan fees. Interest and yields on tax-exempt loans and securities (tax-exempt for federal income tax purposes) are shown on a fully tax equivalent basis. The information is based on average daily balances during the periods presented.
K-20
Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income. The following table analyzes the changes in interest income and interest expense in terms of: (1) changes in volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and (2) changes in yields and rates. The table reflects the extent to which changes in the Corporation’s interest income and interest expense are attributable to changes in rate (change in rate multiplied by prior year volume), changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior year rate) and changes attributable to the combined impact of volume/rate (change in rate multiplied by change in volume). The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume/rate are allocated on a consistent basis between the volume and rate variances. Changes in interest income on loans and securities reflect the changes in interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis.
2021 Results Compared to 2020 Results
The Corporation reported net income available to common stockholders of $10.0 million and $6.6 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The $3.4 million, or 52.0%, increase resulted primarily from increases in net interest income and noninterest income of $2.4 million and $227,000, respectively, and a $2.2 million decrease in the provision for loan losses, partially offset by increases in noninterest expense and the provision for income taxes of $578,000 and $779,000, respectively. Returns on average equity and assets were 10.90% and 0.95%, respectively, for 2021, compared to 7.61% and 0.68%, respectively, for 2020.
Net interest income. The primary source of the Corporation’s revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds, used to fund the earning assets. Net interest income is impacted by the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and changes in the level of interest rates. Tax equivalent net interest income increased $2.4 million to $31.7 million for 2021, compared to $29.3 million for 2020. This increase in net interest income can be attributed to a decrease in interest expense of $2.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in tax equivalent interest income of $526,000.
Interest income. Tax equivalent interest income decreased $526,000, or 1.4%, to $36.8 million for 2021, compared to $37.3 million for 2020. This decrease can be attributed to decreases in interest earned on loans, deposits with banks and dividends received on federal bank stocks of $1.3 million, $100,000 and $78,000, respectively, partially offset by an increase in interest earned on securities of $962,000.
Tax equivalent interest earned on loans receivable decreased $1.3 million, or 3.8%, to $32.8 million for 2021, compared to $34.1 million for 2020. The average yield on loans decreased 20 basis points to 4.12% for 2021, versus 4.32% for 2020 causing an $1.6 million decrease in interest income. Partially offseting this decrease, the average balance of loans increased $7.3 million generating $311,000 of additional interest income on loans. Included in interest earned on loans for the year ended December 31, 2021, is $2.6 million of interest and fees earned on the SBA's PPP lending program compared to $1.6 million for 2020.
Tax equivalent interest earned on securities increased $962,000, or 36.6%, to $3.6 million for 2021, compared to $2.6 million for 2020. The average balance of securities increased $57.4 million resulting in a $1.3 million increase in interest income. Partially offsetting this increase, the average yield on securities decreased 31 basis points to 2.22% for 2021 versus 2.53% for 2020 causing a $346,000 decrease in interest income.
Interest earned on interest-earning deposits with banks decreased $100,000, or 52.4%, to $91,000 for 2021, compared to $191,000 for 2020. The average yield on interest-earning deposits decreased 50 basis points to 0.22% for 2021, versus 0.72% for 2020 causing a $171,000 decrease in interest income. Partially offsetting this decrease, the average balance of these accounts increased $14.0 million, or 52.9%, causing a $71,000 increase in interest income.
Interest earned on federal bank stocks decreased $78,000, or 21.0%, to $293,000 for 2021, compared to $371,000 for 2020. The average yield on federal bank stocks decreased 99 basis points to 5.15% for 2021 versus 6.14% for 2020 causing a $57,000 decrease in interest income. Additionally, the average balance of federal bank stocks decreased $355,000, or 5.9%, resulting in an additional $21,000 decrease in interest income.
K-21
Interest expense. Interest expense decreased $2.9 million, or 36.4% to $5.1 million for 2021, compared to $8.1 million for 2020. This decrease can be attributed to decreases in interest expense on interest-bearing deposits and borrowed funds of $2.7 million and $223,000, repsectively.
Interest expense on deposits decreased $2.7 million, or 37.9%, to $4.5 million for 2021, compared to $7.2 million for 2020. The average rate on interest-bearing deposits decreased by 44 basis points to 0.62% for 2021 versus 1.06% for 2020 causing a $3.1 million decrease in interest expense. Partially offsetting this decrease, the average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $40.4 million, or 6.0%, causing a $408,000 increase in interest expense.
Interest expense on borrowed funds decreased $223,000, or 24.9%, to $674,000 for 2021, compared to $897,000 for 2020. The average balance of borrowed funds decreased $10.1 million, or 25.3%, to $29.8 million for 2021, compared to $39.9 million for 2020 causing a $248,000 decrease in interest expense. Partially offsetting this decrease, the average rate on borrowed funds increased 1 basis point to 2.26% for 2021 versus 2.25% for 2020 causing a $25,000 increase in interest expense.
The following table reconciles interest income on the Consolidated Statements of Net Income to net interest income adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis for the years ended December 31:
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures. In addition to the results of operations presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals (GAAP), management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide information that is useful to investors in understanding the underlying operations, performance and business trends as they facilitate comparison with the performance of others in the financial services industry. Although management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance investors' understanding of the Corporation's business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP.
Provision for loan losses. The Corporation records provisions for loan losses to maintain a level of total allowance for loan losses that management believes, to the best of its knowledge, covers all probable incurred losses estimable at each reporting date. Management considers historical loss experience, the present and prospective financial condition of borrowers, current conditions (particularly as they relate to markets where the Corporation originates loans), the status of nonperforming assets, the estimated underlying value of the collateral and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio.
Nonperforming loans decreased $763,000, or 18.6%, to $3.3 million at December 31, 2021 from $4.1 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease in nonperforming loans was primarily related to a decrease in non-accrual loans in the residential mortgage and commercial real estate portfolios of $809,000 and $363,000, respectively.
The provision for loan losses decreased $2.2 million to $1.1 million for 2021 from $3.2 million for 2020. The Corporation’s allowance for loan losses amounted to $10.4 million, or 1.31% of the Corporation’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2021 compared to $9.6 million or 1.18% of total loans at December 31, 2020. The higher provision for loan losses recorded in 2020 was due to growth in the residential and consumer loan porfolios, the addition of a specifice pandemic qualitative allowance factor, increased risk ratings for loans which were granted payment deferrals and an increase in criticized and classified loans. During 2021, the provision for loan losses decreased as criticized and classified loans decreased and the specific pandemic allowance qualitative factor was reduced. The allowance for loan losses, as a percentage of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020, was 311.3% and 233.5%, respectively. The allocation of the allowance for loan losses related to commercial real estate, commercial business and consumers loans increased during the year primarily as a result of growth in the balances. Some uncertainty remains regarding future levels of criticized and classified loans, nonperforming loans and charge-offs, but some deterioration is may occur as a result of the pandemic. The Corporation will continue to closely monitor changes in the loan portfolio and adjust the provision expense accordingly. At December 31, 2021, there was no provision for loan losses allocated to loans acquired from UASB, NHB or CFB because the unaccreted purchase discount still exceeded the calculated allowance.
Noninterest income. Noninterest income includes revenue that is related to services rendered and activities conducted in the financial services industry, including fees on depository accounts, general transaction and service fees, security and loan sale gains and losses, and earnings on BOLI. Noninterest income increased $227,000, or 5.2%, to $4.6 million for 2021, compared to $4.4 million for 2020. The increase in noninterest income is due to increases in other income, gains on the sale of loans and earnings on bank-owned life insurance of $549,000, $149,000 and $34,000, respectively, partially offset by decreases in gains on the sale of securities and fees and service charges of $442,000 and $63,000, respectively. The increase in other income was primarily related to a non-recurring $337,000 write down in the value of a bank-owned property recognized during 2020 and an increase in interchange fee income in 2021 resulting from easing pandemic restrictions leading to an increase in consumer spending. During 2021, the Corporation sold $14.2 million of residential mortgage loans to the FHLB and realized a net gain of $390,000, compared to sales of $5.2 million and a net gain of $241,000 recognized during 2020. During 2021, the Corporation sold a total of $9.1 million of primarily low-yielding mortgage-backed securities and realized a net gain of $245,000. The sale proceeds were utilized to repay $10.0 million in FHLB term advances. During 2020, the Corporation sold a total of $43.9 million of low-yielding mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligation securities and realized a net gain of $687,000. The sale proceeds were utilized to repay $15.0 million in FHLB term advances and purchase higher yielding municipal and corporate securities.
K-22
Noninterest expense. Noninterest expense increased $578,000, or 2.6%, to $22.6 million for 2021, compared to $22.0 million for 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in compensation and benefits expense, other noninterest expense, professional fees, FDIC insurance expense and intangible amortization expense of $192,000, $188,000, $176,000, $41,000 and $21,000, respectively, partially offset by a $40,000 decrease in premises and equipment e
xpense.
Compensation and employee benefits expense increased $192,000, or 1.7%, to $11.3 million for 2021, compared to $11.1 million for 2020. This increase primarily related to a $306,000 increase management incentive plan expense due to favorable results during 2021, partially offset by a decrease in salary expense and commission expense of $100,000 and $100,000, respectively.
Other noninterest expense increased $188,000, or 3.1%, to $6.2 million for 2021, compared to $6.0 million for 2020. For additional information regarding other noninterest expense see "Note 17 - Other Noninterest Income and Expense" to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page.
Professional fee expense increased $176,000, or 20.9%, to $1.0 million for 2021, compared to $841,000 for 2020. This increase is primarily related to consulting fees related to IT and succession planning projects completed during 2021.
FDIC insurance expense increased $41,000, or 7.6%, to $579,000 for 2021, compared to $538,000 for 2020. This increase was primarily related to an increase in the assessment base, partially offset by a reduction in the assesment rate due to decreases in non-performing assets and increases in capital ratios during 2021.
Premises and equipment expense decreased $40,000, or 1.2%, at $3.3 million for 2021 and 2020. This decrease primarily related to reductions in building repairs and maintenance expense and building depreciation expense of $26,000 and $20,000, respectively due to the sale of two Bank properties.
The provision for income taxes increased $779,000, or 54.3%, to $2.2 million for 2021, compared to $1.4 million for 2020 primarily due to the increase in net income available to common stockholders. The Corporation's effective tax rate was 17.9% for 2021, compared to 17.5% for 2020.
Market Risk Management
Market risk for the Corporation consists primarily of interest rate risk exposure and liquidity risk. The Corporation is not subject to currency exchange risk or commodity price risk, and has no trading portfolio, and therefore, is not subject to any trading risk. In addition, the Corporation does not participate in hedging transactions such as interest rate swaps and caps. Changes in interest rates will impact both income and expense recorded and also the market value of long-term interest-earning assets.
The primary objective of the Corporation’s asset liability management function is to maximize the Corporation’s net interest income while simultaneously maintaining an acceptable level of interest rate risk given the Corporation’s operating environment, capital and liquidity requirements, balance sheet mix, performance objectives and overall business focus. One of the primary measures of the exposure of the Corporation’s earnings to interest rate risk is the timing difference between the repricing or maturity of interest-earning assets and the repricing or maturity of interest-bearing liabilities.
The Corporation’s Board of Directors has established a Finance Committee, consisting of five outside directors, the President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Chief Operating Officer (COO), to monitor market risk, including primarily interest rate risk. This committee, which meets at least quarterly, generally establishes and monitors the investment, interest rate risk and asset liability management policies of the Corporation.
In order to minimize the potential for adverse affects of material and prolonged changes in interest rates on the Corporation’s results of operations, the Corporation’s management team has implemented and continues to monitor asset liability management policies to better match the maturities and repricing terms of the Corporation’s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Such policies have consisted primarily of (i) originating adjustable-rate mortgage loans; (ii) originating short-term secured commercial loans with the rate on the loan tied to the prime rate or reset features in which the rate changes at determined intervals; (iii) emphasizing investment in shorter-term (expected duration of five years or less) investment securities; (iv) selling longer-term (30-year) fixed-rate residential mortgage loans in the secondary market; (v) maintaining a high level of liquid assets (including securities classified as available for sale) that can be readily reinvested in higher yielding investments should interest rates rise; (vi) emphasizing the retention of lower cost savings accounts and other core deposits; and (vii) lengthening liabilities and locking in lower borrowing rates with longer terms whenever possible.
Interest Rate Sensitivity Gap Analysis
The implementation of asset and liability initiatives and strategies and compliance with related policies, combined with other external factors such as demand for the Corporation’s products and economic and interest rate environments in general, has resulted in the Corporation typically maintaining a one-year cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap within internal policy limits of between a positive and negative 15% of total assets. The one-year interest rate sensitivity gap is identified as the difference between the Corporation’s interest-earning assets that are scheduled to mature or reprice within one year and interest-bearing liabilities that are scheduled to mature or reprice within one year.
K-23
The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate-sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate-sensitive liabilities, and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate-sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate-sensitive assets. Generally, during a period of rising interest rates, a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income. Conversely, during a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap would result in an increase in net interest income and a positive gap would adversely affect net interest income. The closer to zero, or more neutral, that gap is maintained, generally, the lesser the impact of market interest rate changes on net interest income.
Based on certain assumptions derived from the Corporation’s historical experience, at December 31, 2021, the Corporation’s interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within one year totaled $345.6 million while the Corporation’s interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year totaled $128.8 million, providing an excess of interest-earning assets over interest-bearing liabilities of $216.8 million or 22.04% of total assets. At December 31, 2021, the percentage of the Corporation’s assets to liabilities maturing or repricing within one year was 268.8%.
The following table presents the amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities outstanding as of December 31, 2021 which are expected to mature, prepay or reprice in each of the future time periods presented:
Although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates. In the event of a change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table. The ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase.
Interest Rate Sensitivity Simulation Analysis
The Corporation also utilizes income simulation modeling in measuring its interest rate risk and managing its interest rate sensitivity. The Finance Committee of the Board of Directors believes that simulation modeling enables the Corporation to more accurately evaluate and manage the possible effects on net interest income due to the exposure to changing market interest rates and different loan and security prepayment and deposit decay assumptions under various interest rate scenarios.
As with gap analysis and earnings simulation modeling, assumptions about the timing and variability of cash flows are critical in net portfolio equity valuation analysis. Particularly important are the assumptions driving mortgage prepayments and the assumptions about expected attrition of the core deposit portfolios. These assumptions are based on the Corporation’s historical experience.
The Corporation has established the following guidelines for assessing interest rate risk:
Net interest income simulation. Given a 200 basis point immediate increase or decrease in market interest rates, net interest income may not change by more than 8% for a one-year period.
Economic value of equity simulation. Economic value of equity is the present value of the Corporation’s existing assets less the present value of the Corporation’s existing liabilities. Given a 200 basis point immediate and permanent increase or decrease in market interest rates, economic value of equity may not correspondingly decrease or increase by more than 20%.
K-24
These guidelines take into consideration the current interest rate environment, the Corporation’s financial asset and financial liability product mix and characteristics and liquidity sources among other factors. Given the current rate environment, a drop in short-term market interest rates of 200 basis points immediately or over a one-year horizon would seem unlikely. This should be considered in evaluating modeling results outlined in the table below.
The following table presents the simulated impact of a 100 basis point or 200 basis point upward or downward shift of market interest rates on net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This analysis was done assuming that the interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability levels at December 31, 2021 remained constant. The impact of the market rate movements on net interest income was developed by simulating the effects of rates changing immediately for a one-year period from the December 31, 2021 levels for net interest income.
The expected increase in 2020 and 2021 net interest income in the rising rate scenarios shown in the table above resulted from the Corporation having an excess of immediately repricing interest-earning assets over immediately repricing interest-bearing liabilities.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
The consolidated financial statements of the Corporation and related notes presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) which require the measurement of financial condition and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.
Unlike most industrial companies, substantially all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services since such prices are affected by inflation to a larger degree than interest rates. In the current interest rate environment, liquidity and the maturity structure of the Corporation’s assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels.
Capital Resources
Total stockholders’ equity increased $5.5 million, or 6.0%, to $97.0 million at December 31, 2021 from $91.5 million at December 31, 2020. Net income available to common stockholders of $10.0 million in 2021 represented an increase in earnings of $3.4 million, or 52.0%, compared to 2020. The Corporation’s capital to assets ratio increased to 9.2% at December 31, 2021 from 8.9% at December 31, 2020.
While continuing to sustain a strong capital position, dividends on common stock were $3.3 million in 2021 and 2020. In addition, stockholders have taken part in the Corporation’s dividend reinvestment plan introduced during 2003 with 40% of registered shareholder accounts active in the plan at December 31, 2021. Dividend reinvestment is achieved through the purchase of common shares on the secondary market.
Capital adequacy is intended to enhance the Corporation’s ability to support growth while protecting the interest of stockholders and depositors and to ensure that capital ratios are in compliance with regulatory minimum requirements. Regulatory agencies have developed certain capital ratio requirements that are used to assist them in monitoring the safety and soundness of financial institutions. At December 31, 2021, the Bank was in excess of all regulatory capital requirements. See "Note 10 - Regulatory Matters" to the consolidated financial statements on page.
Liquidity
The Corporation’s primary sources of funds generally have been deposits obtained through the offices of the Bank, borrowings from the FHLB, and amortization and prepayments of outstanding loans and maturing securities. During 2021, the Corporation used its sources of funds primarily to purchase securities and retire outstanding debt. As of December 31, 2021, the Corporation had outstanding loan commitments, including undisbursed loans and amounts available under credit lines, totaling $124.6 million, and standby letters of credit totaling $444,000, net of cash collateral maintained by the Bank. The Bank has established policies to monitor and manage liquidity levels to ensure the Bank’s ability to meet demands for customer withdrawals and the repayment of borrowings.
At December 31, 2021, time deposits amounted to $150.7 million, or 16.4%, of the Corporation’s total consolidated deposits, including approximately $48.0 million scheduled to mature within the next year. Management believes that the Corporation has adequate resources to fund all of its commitments, that all of its commitments will be funded as required by related maturity dates and that, based upon past experience and current pricing policies, it can adjust the rates of time deposits to retain a substantial portion of maturing liabilities.
Aside from liquidity available from customer deposits or through sales and maturities of securities, the Corporation and the Bank have alternative sources of funds. These sources include a line of credit for the Corporation with a correspondent bank, the Bank’s line of credit and term borrowing capacity from the FHLB and, to a more limited extent, through the sale of loans. At December 31, 2021, the Bank’s borrowing capacity with the FHLB, net of funds borrowed and irrevocable standby letters of credit issued to secure certain deposit accounts, was $249.3 million.
K-25
The Corporation pays a regular quarterly cash dividend. The Corporation paid dividends of $0.30 per common share for each of the four quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively. On February 16, 2022, the Corporation declared a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per common share payable on March 18, 2022 to shareholders of record on March 1, 2022. The determination of future dividends on the Corporation’s common stock will depend on conditions existing at that time with consideration given to the Corporation’s earnings, capital and liquidity needs, among other factors.
Management is not aware of any conditions, including any regulatory recommendations or requirements, which would adversely impact its liquidity or its ability to meet funding needs in the ordinary course of business.
Critical Accounting Policies
The Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the industry in which it operates. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates or judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates or judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, and as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates or judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility. The fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by third-party sources, when available. When third-party information is not available, valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily though the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques.
The most significant accounting policies followed by the Corporation are presented in "Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Management views critical accounting policies to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions, and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the financial statements. Management has identified the following as critical accounting policies:
Allowance for loan losses. The Corporation considers that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than other significant accounting policies. The balance in the allowance for loan losses is determined based on management’s review and evaluation of the loan portfolio in relation to past loss experience, the size and composition of the portfolio, current economic events and conditions and other pertinent factors, including management’s assumptions as to future delinquencies, recoveries and losses. All of these factors may be susceptible to significant change. Among the many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses, some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment. Although management believes its process for determining the allowance adequately considers all of the potential factors that could potentially result in credit losses, the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change. To the extent actual outcomes differ from management’s estimates, additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact the Corporation’s financial condition or earnings in future periods.
Other-than-temporary impairment. Management evaluates debt securities for other-than-temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic, market or other concerns warrant such evaluation. Consideration is given to: (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions and (4) whether the Corporation has the intent to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery.
Goodwill and intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess cost over fair value of assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. Goodwill is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on the fair value of the reporting unit compared to its carrying amount, including goodwill. Impairment exists when a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value. As part of the Corporation's qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment, management considered the triggering event of the COVID-19 pandemic and determined that significant change in the general economic environment and financial markets, including the Corporation's market capitalization, represented an interim impairment indicator requiring continued evaluation. Because of the economic uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, the Corporation engaged an independent third party to perform the Step 1, quantitative analysis of goodwill as of November 30. Based on the analysis performed, management concluded that the Corporation's goodwill was not impaired as of November 30, 2021. If for any future period it is determined that there has been impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill balances, the Corporation will record a charge to earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on net income, but not risk-based capital ratios. See "Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" on page for the Corporation's accounting policy on goodwill and see "Note 6 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets" on page in the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of the factors considered by management in the assessment.
