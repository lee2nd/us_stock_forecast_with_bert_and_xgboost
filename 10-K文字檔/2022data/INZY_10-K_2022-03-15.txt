Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward-looking statements. For convenience of presentation some of the numbers have been rounded in the text below.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage rare disease biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics for the treatment of diseases of abnormal mineralization impacting the vasculature, soft tissue and skeleton. Through our in-depth understanding of the biological pathways involved in mineralization, we are pursuing the development of therapeutics to address the underlying causes of these debilitating diseases. It is well established that two genes, ENPP1 and ABCC6, play key roles in a critical mineralization pathway and that defects in these genes lead to abnormal mineralization. We are initially focused on developing a novel therapy to treat the rare genetic diseases of ENPP1 and ABCC6 Deficiencies.
Our lead product candidate, INZ-701, is a soluble, recombinant, genetically engineered, fusion protein that is designed to correct a defect in the mineralization pathway caused by ENPP1 and ABCC6 Deficiencies. This pathway is central to the regulation of calcium deposition throughout the body and is further associated with neointimal proliferation, or the overgrowth of smooth muscle cells inside blood vessels. We have generated robust preclinical proof of concept data demonstrating that in animal models INZ-701 prevented pathological calcification, led to improvements in overall health and survival and prevented neointimal proliferation. In addition, INZ-701 achieved survival benefit in a mouse model of ENPP1 Deficiency. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, have granted orphan drug designation to INZ-701 for the treatment of ENPP1 Deficiency and ABCC6 Deficiency. The FDA has also granted fast track designation for INZ-701 for the treatment of ENPP1 Deficiency, and rare pediatric disease designation for the treatment of ENPP1 Deficiency.
In November 2021, we initiated our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of INZ-701 in patients with ENPP1 Deficiency. We plan to report preliminary safety and biomarker data from this trial in the first half of 2022. The United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency authorized our Clinical Trial Application, or CTA, to allow us to initiate clinical development of INZ-701 for the treatment of INZ-701 for the treatment of ENPP1 Deficiency in the United Kingdom. In the third quarter of 2021, we filed a CTA with the regulatory authorities in Canada, which was approved by Health Canada in November 2021, and in the fourth quarter of 2021 , we filed a CTA with regulatory authorities in the European Union, which was approved by the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices in Germany in February 2022, to allow us to initiate clinical development of INZ-701 for the treatment of ENPP1 Deficiency outside of the United States and the United Kingdom .
In June 2021, the National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products, or ANSM, in France authorized our CTA and, in July 2021, the FDA cleared our IND for a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of INZ-701 for the treatment of ABCC6 Deficiency. We have activated a clinical trial site in the United States and an additional trial site in the United Kingdom. We are actively screening patients for enrollment in this planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial and expect enrollment of the first patient in our planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial in the second quarter of 2022. We plan to report preliminary safety and biomarker data from this trial in the first half of 2022.
Subject to successfully completing clinical development of INZ-701 in ENPP1 and ABCC6 Deficiencies, we plan to seek marketing approvals for INZ-701 on a worldwide basis. Beyond our development focus on INZ-701, we believe that our therapeutic approach has the potential to benefit patients suffering from additional diseases of abnormal mineralization, including those without a clear genetic basis, such as calciphylaxis. We are also exploring the potential for development of a gene therapy for ENPP1 Deficiency.
Our Operations
We have not yet commercialized any products or generated any revenue from product sales. We have only recently initiated our first clinical trial. Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, securing intellectual property rights, conducting research and development activities, conducting preclinical studies and an early-stage clinical trial, establishing arrangements for the manufacture of INZ-701 and longer term planning for potential commercialization. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sales of convertible preferred stock and sales of common stock in our initial public offering, or IPO. Through December 31, 2021, we had received net proceeds of $111.5 million from the sales of our convertible preferred stock and net proceeds of approximately $115.9 million from the sale of our common stock in our IPO.
Uncertainty remains as to the potential impact of COVID-19 on our future research and development activities and the potential for a material impact on the Company increases the longer the virus impacts certain aspects of economic activity around the world. The full extent to which COVID-19 will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our ability to activate trial sites and fulfill our clinical trial enrollment needs, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain, including as a result of new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain it or treat COVID-19, as well as the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets, the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions, the ultimate impact on financial markets and the global economy, the effectiveness of vaccines and vaccine distribution efforts and the effectiveness of other actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease.
Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate revenue from product sales sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of INZ-701 or one or more of our future product candidates and programs. Our net losses were $56.6 million and $56.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $147.7 million.
Our total operating expenses were $56.6 million and $57.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses for the foreseeable future. We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing and planned activities, particularly as we advance our preclinical activities and our ongoing and planned clinical trials. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for INZ-701 or any other product candidate we develop, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.
As a result, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate significant revenues from product sales, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution and licensing arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds. If we are unable to raise capital or obtain adequate funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. In addition, attempting to secure additional financing may divert the time and attention of our management from day-to-day activities and distract from our research and development efforts.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our pipeline of product candidates or even continue our operations.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $111.8 million. Based upon our recurring losses current and projected cash flow, we note there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these financial statements are issued. As a result, in order to continue to operate our business beyond that time, we will need to raise additional funds. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate funds on terms acceptable to us, on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently anticipate.
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2021, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the first quarter of 2023. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us. See “-Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
To finance our operations beyond that point, we will need to raise additional capital, which cannot be assured.
We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:
•conduct our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of INZ-701 for ENPP1 Deficiency;
•prepare for, initiate and conduct a planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial of INZ-701 for ABCC6 Deficiency;
•prepare for, initiate and conduct later stage clinical trials of INZ-701 for patients with ENPP1 and ABCC6 Deficiencies;
•conduct research and preclinical testing of INZ-701 for additional indications;
•conduct research and preclinical testing of other product candidates;
•advance INZ-701 for additional indications or any other product candidate into clinical development;
•seek marketing approval for INZ-701 or any other product candidate if it successfully completes clinical trials;
•scale up our manufacturing processes and capabilities to support clinical trials of INZ-701 or any other product candidates we develop and for commercialization of any product candidate for which we may obtain marketing approval;
•establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidate for which we may obtain marketing approval;
•in-license or acquire additional technologies or product candidates;
•make any payments to Yale University, or Yale, under our license agreement or sponsored research agreement with Yale;
•maintain, expand, enforce and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•hire additional clinical, regulatory, quality control and scientific personnel; and
•add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our research, product development and planned future commercialization efforts and our operations as a public company.
Financial Operations Overview
Revenue
To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future. If development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval or we enter into collaboration or similar agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue from those product candidates.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses primarily consist of costs incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our lead product candidate, INZ-701.
We expense research and development costs as incurred. These expenses include:
•fees and expenses incurred in connection with the in-license of technology and intellectual property rights, including the write-off of acquired in-process research and development assets with no alternative future use;
•expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including contract research organizations, or CROs, and other third parties that conduct research, preclinical and clinical activities on our behalf as well as third parties that manufacture our product candidates for use in our preclinical studies and planned clinical trials;
•manufacturing scale-up expenses and the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical trial materials, including manufacturing validation batches;
•employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions;
•the costs of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing preclinical studies and clinical trial materials;
•costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and
•facilities costs, which include depreciation costs of equipment and allocated expenses for rent, utilities and other operating costs.
We recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our service providers.
Research and development activities are central to our business model. We are still in the early stages of development of INZ-701. We initiated our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of INZ-701 for ENPP1 Deficiency in November 2021. We expect to enroll the first patient in our planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial of INZ-701 for ABCC6 Deficiency in the second quarter of 2022. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in preclinical development or in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. From inception through December 31, 2021, we have incurred $94.3 million of research and development costs for INZ-701. We expect that our research and development costs will continue to increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we prepare for, initiate and conduct clinical trials of INZ-701, scale our manufacturing processes and advance development of INZ-701 for additional indications and potentially additional product candidates.
The successful development of INZ-701 and other potential future product candidates is highly uncertain. Accordingly, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of any product candidate. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, we will generate revenue and material net cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. We may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for any of our product candidates. The success of INZ-701 and any other product candidate we develop will depend on a variety of factors, including:
•successfully completing preclinical studies and initiating clinical trials;
•successfully enrolling patients in and completing clinical trials;
•scaling up manufacturing processes and capabilities to support clinical trials of INZ-701 and any other product candidates we develop;
•applying for and receiving marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•obtaining and maintaining intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity for INZ-701 and any other product candidates we develop;
•making arrangements for commercial manufacturing capabilities;
•establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and launching commercial sales of INZ-701 and any other product candidates we develop, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;
•acceptance of INZ-701 and any other product candidates we develop, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;
•effectively competing with other therapies;
•obtaining and maintaining coverage, adequate pricing and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors;
•maintaining, enforcing, defending and protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;
•not infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating others’ intellectual property or proprietary rights; and
•maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of our products following receipt of any marketing approvals.
A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development, manufacture or commercialization activities of any of our product candidates could mean a significant change in the costs, timing and viability associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in our clinical trials due to patient enrollment or other reasons, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, related benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense for personnel in executive, finance and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees for legal, consulting, accounting, tax and audit services, and information technology infrastructure costs. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research activities and development of our product candidates. We incur and anticipate that we will continue to incur increased costs associated with being a public company, including costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance and tax-related services related to maintaining compliance with requirements of Nasdaq and the Securities and Exchange Commission; director and officer insurance costs; and investor and public relations costs. We anticipate the additional costs for these services will substantially increase our general and administrative expenses. Additionally, we may experience an increase in payroll and expense as a result of our preparation for potential commercial operations, especially as it relates to sales and marketing costs.
Interest Income
Interest income consists of income from bank deposits and investments.
Other Income (Expense), net
Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign exchange gains or losses.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):
Research and Development Expense
Research and development expense decreased by $8.8 million to $37.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $46.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in research and development expense was primarily attributable to the following:
•a decrease of $17.8 million as a result of the charge taken in 2020 for our non-recurring, non-cash purchase of in-process research and development intellectual property assets from Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Alexion, in exchange for shares of our Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock;
•a decrease of $2.4 million in other research and development expenses such as toxicology studies;
•a decrease of $1.1 million due to decreases in manufacturing operations based on the timing of production runs;
•an increase of $7.0 million due to increased salaries, stock-based compensation, and other employee-related costs to support the growth of the business; and
•an increase of $5.5 million related to costs to support the preparation, initiation, and execution of our ongoing and planned clinical trials.
We expect that our research and development expenses will increase for the foreseeable future as we prepare for, initiate and conduct clinical trials of INZ-701, further scale our manufacturing processes and advance development of INZ-701 for additional indications or development of additional product candidates.
General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative expense increased by $8.4 million to $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to an increase in our employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, and benefits related to an increase in the number of general and administrative employees, an increase in legal fees related to patents, new contracts and our operations as a public company, and generally higher fees in areas such as audit, tax and information technology to support our growth and support our operations as a public company.
We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods as we expand our operations and incur additional costs in connection with being a public company.
Interest Income
Interest income decreased by $0.2 million to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to a lower cash balance on which interest was earned for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
Other Income (Expense), net
Other income (expense), net, consisting primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses, decreased by $0.4 million to a net loss of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from a net gain of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was driven by cash balances we hold which are denominated in Euros and their related change compared to the U.S. Dollar during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
Since our inception, we have not generated any revenue and have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sales of convertible preferred stock and sales of common stock in our IPO. Through December 31, 2021, we had received net cash proceeds of $111.5 million from sales of our convertible preferred stock. In July 2020, we completed our IPO in which we received net proceeds, inclusive of the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares, of approximately $115.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $111.8 million.
On August 11, 2021, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3, or the Registration Statement, which was declared effective on August 23, 2021. Under the Registration Statement, we may offer and sell up to $200.0 million of a variety of securities, including common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, debt securities, warrants, subscription rights or units from time to time pursuant to one or more offerings at prices and terms to be determined at the time of the sale. In connection with the filing of the Registration Statement, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement with Jefferies LLC, as sales agent, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock with an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million under an “at-the-market” offering program. To date, we have not sold any securities under the Registration Statement.
Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation. The following table provides information regarding our total cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 (in thousands):
Cash Flows
The following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):
Net Cash Used in Operating Activities
The cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in components of working capital.
Net cash used in operating activities was $48.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $36.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in cash used in operating activities of $12.2 million was primarily attributable to the increase in our net loss, adjusted for non-cash items of $5.4 million, as well as an increase in the use of cash for accounts payable and a decrease in the use of cash for accrued expenses.
Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities was $42.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $117.2 million of net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. In the year ended December 31, 2021, purchases of marketable securities of $122.0 million were offset by $165.2 million in maturities of investments. In the year ended December 31, 2020, $177.9 million of investments were purchased following the closing of our IPO in July 2020. These purchases were offset by $61.3 million in maturities of investments. We also had cash outflows of $0.4 million related to the purchase of property and equipment in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to cash outflows of $0.6 million related to the purchase of property and equipment in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $149.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to $115.9 million in net proceeds from our IPO in July 2020 and $33.6 million in net proceeds from the sale and issuance of 23,566,431 shares of Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock in June 2020.
Funding Requirements
We expect to devote substantial financial resources to our ongoing and planned activities, particularly as we conduct our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of INZ-701 for ENPP1 Deficiency, prepare for, initiate and conduct our planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial of INZ-701 for ABCC6 Deficiency, and continue research and development and initiate additional clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for, INZ-701 and any other product candidate we develop. We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing and planned activities, particularly as we advance our preclinical activities and our ongoing and planned clinical trials. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for INZ-701 or any other product candidates we develop, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution. Furthermore, as a result of our IPO, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital or obtain adequate funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. In addition, attempting to secure additional financing may divert the time and attention of our management from day-to-day activities and distract from our research and development efforts.
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•the progress, costs and results of our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of INZ-701 for ENPP1 Deficiency and our planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ABCC6 Deficiency and any future clinical development of INZ-701 for these indications;
•the scope, progress, costs and results of research, preclinical testing and clinical trials of INZ-701 for additional indications;
•the number of and development requirements for additional indications for INZ-701 or for any other product candidates we develop;
•our ability to scale up our manufacturing processes and capabilities to support clinical trials of INZ-701 and any other product candidates we develop;
•the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of INZ-701 and any other product candidates we develop;
•potential changes in the regulatory environment and enforcement rules;
•our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such arrangements;
•the payment of license fees and other costs of our technology license arrangements;
•the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution, for INZ-701 and any other product candidates we develop for which we may receive marketing approval;
•the amount and timing of revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of INZ-701 and any other product candidates we develop for which we receive marketing approval;
•potential changes in pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement infrastructure;
•the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property and proprietary rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims; and
•the extent to which we in-license or acquire additional technologies or product candidates.
As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $111.8 million. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2021 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the first quarter of 2023. However, we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us. In addition, changing circumstances could cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control. As a result, we could deplete our capital resources sooner than we currently expect. In addition, because the successful development of INZ-701 and any other product candidates that we pursue is highly uncertain, at this time we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of any product candidate.
Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. We will not generate commercial revenues unless and until we can achieve sales of products, which we do not anticipate for a number of years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, and may be impacted by the economic climate and market conditions. For example, market volatility resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or any other future infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics could also adversely impact our ability to access capital as and when needed.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenues from product sales, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing common stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our operations and ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions, engaging in acquisition, merger or collaboration transactions, selling or licensing our assets, making capital expenditures, redeeming our stock, making certain investments or declaring dividends.
If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.
Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies
We currently lease office and laboratory space. Additional information about these leases and our commitments under them can be found in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We have entered into a license agreement with Yale under which we are responsible to pay annual license maintenance fees, milestone payments and royalties. The amount, timing and likelihood of such milestone and royalty payments are not known. We have also entered into a sponsored research agreement with Yale under which we agreed to provide research support funding in the aggregate amount of $2.4 million over the five and a half year period from contract inception through June 2022. Additional information about these arrangements can be found in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following critical accounting estimates are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Accrued Research and Development Expenses
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing purchase orders and open contracts, communicating with our personnel and suppliers to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by CROs and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, among others, in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.
We contract with CROs and CMOs to conduct clinical and manufacturing and other research and development services on our behalf. We base our expenses related to CROs and CMOs on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with them. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our CROs or CMOs will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or amount of prepaid expense
accordingly. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.
Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.
Fair Value of Stock-Based Awards
We estimate the fair value of our stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires inputs of subjective assumptions, including: (1) the expected volatility of our common stock; (2) the expected term of the award; (3) the risk-free interest rate; (4) expected dividends; and (5) the fair value of common stock. Due to a lack of sufficient company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our computation of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a representative group of public companies with similar characteristics to us, including stage of product development, life science industry focus, length of trading history and similar vesting provisions. The historical volatility data is calculated based on a period of time commensurate with the expected term assumption. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available or until circumstances change, such that the identified entities are no longer representative companies. In the latter case, more suitable, similar entities whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation. We estimate the expected term of our stock options granted to employees using the simplified method, whereby the expected term equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. We utilize this method as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. For stock options granted to non-employees, we utilize the contractual term of the option as the basis for the expected term assumption. The risk-free interest rate is based on a U.S. Treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected term of the stock options. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no current plans to pay any dividends on our common stock. Prior to completion of the IPO, the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying the stock options was determined by the Company’s board of directors. Because there was no public market for the Company’s common stock prior to the Company’s IPO, the board of directors determined fair value of common stock at the time of grant of the option by considering a number of objective and subjective factors including independent third-party valuations of the Company’s common stock, sales of convertible preferred stock to unrelated third parties, operating and financial performance, the lack of liquidity of capital stock and the general and industry specific economic outlook, among other factors. Following the Company’s IPO, the fair value of the Company’s common stock has been determined based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the grant date.

Emerging Growth Company Status
The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 permits an “emerging growth company” such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and will do so until such time that we either (1) irrevocably elect to “opt out” of such extended transition period or (2) no longer qualify as an emerging growth company.
