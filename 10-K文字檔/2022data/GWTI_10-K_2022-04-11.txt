Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements and the notes to those Financial Statements that are included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and were prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under the “Risk Factors,” “Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Description of Business” sections and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We use words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “continuing,” “ongoing,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “predict,” and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business, our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future.
In the below discussion, “we,” “our,” “us,” the “Company” and similar terms in this report, as well as references to “UMED” and “Greenway” all refer to Greenway Technologies, Inc., and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Greenway Innovative Energy, Inc., unless the context requires otherwise.
Greenway Technologies, Inc. is engaged in the research and development of proprietary gas-to-liquids syngas conversion systems and micro-plants that can be scaled to meet specific gas field production requirements. The company’s patented and proprietary technologies have been realized in its first commercial G-Reformer unit, a unique component used to convert natural gas into synthesis gas, which when combined with a Fischer-Tropsch reactor and catalyst, produces fuels including gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and methanol. G-Reformer units can be deployed to process a variety of natural gas streams including pipeline gas, associated gas, flared gas, vented gas, coal-bed methane and/or biomass gas. When derived from any of these natural gas sources, the liquid fuels created are incrementally cleaner than conventionally produced oil-based fuels. Greenway’s objective is to become a material direct and licensed producer of renewable GTL synthesized diesel and jet fuels, with a near term focus on U.S. market opportunities.
The Company believes that its proprietary G-Reformer is a major innovation in gas reforming and GTL technology in general. Initial tests have demonstrated that the Company’s solution appears to be superior to legacy technologies which are more costly, have a larger footprint and cannot be easily deployed at field sites to process associated gas, stranded gas, coal-bed methane, vented gas, or flared gas - all markets the Company seeks to service.
On April 28, 2020, the Company was issued a new U.S. Patent 10,633,594 B1 for syngas generation for gas-to-liquid fuel conversion. The Company has several other pending patent applications, both domestic and international, related to various components and processes involving our proprietary GTL methods, which when granted, will further complement our existing portfolio of issued patents and pending patent applications.
On December 8, 2020, the Company announced an exclusive worldwide patent licensing agreement with the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) for all patent applications currently filed with the Patent and Trademark Office relating to GWTI’s natural gas reforming technologies developed under its sponsored research agreement with UTA.
On December 15, 2020, the Company announced additional information regarding valuable outputs produced by the company’s proprietary G-Reformer™ catalyst reactor and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) technology which combine to form the “Greer-Wright” GTL solution. Originally developed to convert natural gas into ultra-clean synthetic fuel, recent research and development activity has shown that the technology can also allow the extraction of high-value chemicals and alcohols. The chemical outputs include n-Hexane, n-Heptane, n-Octane, n-Decane, n-Dodecane, and n-Tridecane. Alcohols produced include ethanol and methanol. The company has identified worldwide industrial demand for these outputs which will significantly improve the economic return on investment (ROI) of GTL plants that are based on GWTI’s technology. GWTI is a development-stage company with plans to continue its unique and patented technology.
In February 2021, the Company was issued Patent 10,907,104, the fourth patent relating to the company’s proprietary G-Reformer™ technology which allows for the conversion of natural gas into synthesis gas. The newly issued patent extends the methods and details of generating syngas using the apparatus described in a previously issued patent No. 10,633,594, the company’s third patent. As described in the patent, methane, oxygen, and steam are continuously injected into the combustion section of the apparatus to generate carbon monoxide along with unreacted methane and steam. The carbon monoxide, unreacted methane, and steam then enter the catalyst chamber where these components react to generate syngas. The pressure inside the reaction vessel is controlled at no higher than 5 psig.
Further, the Company believes its technologies and processes will allow for multiple small-scale GTL plants to be built with substantially lower up-front and ongoing costs resulting in more profitable results for O&G operators. In addition, the proprietary technology based around the G-Reformer is unique in that it also allows for transportable (mobile) GTL plants with a much smaller footprint as compared to legacy large-scale technologies. Greenway is in discussions with a number of oil and gas operators and other interested parties to license and obtain joint venture or other forms of capital funding to build its first third-party customer gas-to-liquid plant.
Mining Interest
In December 2010, UMED acquired the rights to approximately 1,440 acres of placer mining claims located on Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) land in Mohave County, Arizona for 5,066,000 shares of restricted Common A stock. Early indications, from samples taken and processed, provided reason to believe that the potential recovery value of the metals located on the 1,440 acres is significant, but only actual mining and processing will determine the ultimate value which may be realized from this property holding. The Company is currently exploring strategic options to partner or sell its interest in this acreage, while it focuses on its emerging GTL technology sales and marketing efforts.
Going Concern
We remain dependent on outside sources of funding for continuation of our operations. Our independent registered public accounting firm issued a going concern qualification in their report dated April 8, 2022, which is included with our consolidated Financial Statements and raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
As of December 31, 2021, we had total liabilities in excess of assets by $9,886,820. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2021, we used net cash of $791,906 for operating activities. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
The Financial Statements included in our Form 10-K do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in existence. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient new cash flows to meet our obligations on a timely basis, to obtain additional financing as may be required, and/or ultimately to attain profitable operations. However, there is no assurance that profitable operations, financing, or sufficient new cash flows will occur in the future.
Our ability to achieve profitability will depend upon our ability to finance, manufacture, and market/operate GTL units. Our growth is dependent on attaining profit from our operations and our raising additional capital either through the sale of our Common Stock or borrowing. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise any equity financing or sell any of our products at a profit. We will be unable to pay our obligations in the normal course of business or service our debt in a timely manner throughout 2022 without raising additional debt or equity capital. There can be no assurance that we will raise additional debt or equity capital.
We are currently evaluating strategic alternatives that include (i) raising new equity capital and/or (ii) issuing additional debt instruments. The process is ongoing, lengthy and has inherent costs. There can be no assurance that the exploration of these strategic alternatives will result in any specific action to alleviate our 12-month working capital needs or result in any other transaction.
While we are attempting to commence operations and generate revenues, our cash position may not be significant enough to support our daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of an offering of our securities. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement our business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity for us to continue as a going concern. While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate revenues and in our ability to raise additional funds, we may not be successful. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our capability to further implement our business plan and generate revenues.
Results of Operations
For Year Ended December 31, 2021 as Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020:
We had no revenues for consolidated operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. We reported consolidated net losses during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 of $1,744,376 and $2,541,972, respectively.
The following table summarizes consolidated operating expenses and other income and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020:
Operating Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2021, operating expenses decreased to $1,156,103, as compared to $1,371,512 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was due primarily to a $139,667 decrease in salaries, a $84,591 decrease in legal expense and a $42,000 decrease in compensation expense related to warrants in 2020 offset by a $128,000 increase in research and development expenses in 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Major operating expense categories consisted of the following:
Salaries. During the year ended December 31, 2021, total salaries decreased to $390,333 as compared to $530,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease is due to one employee leaving in the fourth quarter of 2020 and another leaving in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Consulting Fees. During the year ended December 31, 2021, consulting expense decreased to $325,899, as compared to $332,961 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Travel Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2021, travel expenses decreased to $0, as compared to $18,487 in the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in travel expenses was due no travel in 2021 compared air travel during the first quarter of 2020.
Legal Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, legal expenses decreased to $122,205, as compared to $206,796 in the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in legal fees was due primarily to decreased legal matters in progress during 2021 and settlement of various matters year to year.
Research and Development Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2021, research and development costs increased to $158,000, as compared to $30,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020. The change was due to the payment of the renewal fee for the SRA with the University of Texas at Arlington and for the monthly payments on the SRA for the testing and commercialization phase of our GTL technology.
Interest Expense. During the year ended December 31, 2021, interest expense decreased to $588,273, including interest to related parties of $478,646, as compared to $769,170 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the decreased interest expense due to the settlement of the PowerUp loans in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liability and Derivative Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the gain on the fair value of derivatives was $0 as compared to a gain of $62,645 for the change in the derivative fair value and a debt expense of $33,978 related to the derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change was due to the execution of the two PowerUp convertible notes payable in the first quarter of 2020, and the related changes in their fair values through 2020. The convertible notes payable were settled as of December 31, 2020
Loss from Operations. Our net loss from operations decreased to $1,156,103 in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $1,371,512 for the year ended December 31, 2020, for the reasons listed above.
Net Loss. Our consolidated net loss decreased to $1,744,376, or a negative $0.01 per basic and diluted earnings share for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to a net loss of $2,541,972, or a negative $0.01 per basic and diluted earnings share for the same period ended 2020. The weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock used in the earnings per share for the basic and dilutive computation was 342,400,231 for the year ended December 31, 2021, and 312,854,191 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We do not currently have sufficient working capital to fund our expected future operations. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to continue our operations without securing additional adequate funding. We had $60,549 in cash, total assets of $60,605, and total liabilities of $9,947,425 as of December 31, 2021. Total accumulated deficit at December 31, 2021, was ($34,766,177).
Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet all of its financial obligations. The following table provides certain selected balance sheet comparisons between December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020:
To increase our working capital we have considered completing additional private stock sales and entering into new debt instruments. During the year ended December 31, 2021, sales of our Common Stock provided $656,500. During the year ended December 31, 2020, sales of our Common Stock provided $155,000. In January 2020, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), with PowerUp Lending Group, Ltd., a Virginia corporation (“PowerUp”), that specializes in making funding commitments to small-cap public companies. PowerUp had agreed to provide up to $1,000,000 to us over a twelve (12) month period, subject to period determined stock price and trading attributes, and we borrowed $171,000 during the first quarter of 2020 under this from of Purchase Agreement. During the third and fourth quarters of 2020, the lenders converted the outstanding convertible notes to equity.
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021, was $791,906, as compared to $686,032 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Investing activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ending December 31, 2021 was $0, as compared to $25,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $850,827 for the year ended December 31, 2021, comprised of $656,500 in sales of our Common Stock, $354,327 received from stockholder advances, less $100,000 of payments on notes payable to related parties and $60,000 on other notes payable.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $696,617 for the year ended December 31, 2020, comprised of $155,000 in sales of our Common Stock, $171,000 in proceeds from convertible notes payable, $215,609 in proceeds from Notes - Related Parties, $270,008 received from stockholder advances, less $115,000 of payments on notes payable related to legal settlements.
Our accompanying Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our general business strategy is to first develop our GTL technology to maintain our basic viability, while seeking significant development capital for full commercialization. As shown in the accompanying Financial Statements, we have incurred an accumulated deficit of $34,766,177 and $33,021,801 as of December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Our ability to continue as a going concern is in doubt and dependent upon achieving a profitable level of operations and on our ability to obtain necessary financing to fund ongoing operations.
Commitments
Capital Expenditures
The last funded Scope of Work (“SOW”) under our SRA with UTA was completed in the year ended December 2019, with payments made of $120,000 to complete the work described in the prior SOW. We signed a new SRA with UTA effective March 1, 2021 which relates to the testing and commercialization phase of our GTL technology. The term of the agreement is through February 15, 2022. The first payment under the SRA was made in March 2021 for $30,000. Going forward on the 15th of each month we will pay UTA $15,454.54 through February 15, 2022, for a total commitment of $200,000.

Consulting Agreements
On September 7, 2018, Wildcat, a company controlled by Shareholder Marshall Gleason, filed suit against us alleging claims arising from the Gleason Agreement, seeking to recover monetary damages, interest, court costs, and attorney’s fees. In a separate lawsuit, Wildcat filed suit claiming that the Company breached that certain Promissory Note dated on or about November 13, 2017, entered into between Wildcat as lender and Greenway as borrower, and as a result Wildcat initiated an action in County Court at Law No. 2 of Tarrant County, Texas, Cause No. 2018-006416-2. On March 6, 2019, we entered into a Rule 11 Agreement with Gleason settling both disputes, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.52 to this Form 10-K and incorporated by reference. Pursuant to the Rule 11 Agreement, the parties agreed to abate both cases until the earlier of a default of the performance of the Rule 11 Agreement or October 30, 2019, whichever be sooner. The Rule 11 Agreement provided that if we timely performed through October 15, 2019, the parties would file a joint motion for dismissal and present agreed orders of dismissal with prejudice for both lawsuits. The Company performed in all regards under the Rule 11 Agreement, however Gleason refused to sign the Wildcat Settlement Agreement at the point of the Company’s having performed its obligations. The parties’ respective counsels then mutually agreed to extend the original October 30, 2019 settlement date until at least the end of the year while the parties waited for Gleason’s signature. Gleason signed the Compromise Settlement and Release Agreement on February 4, 2020, and all litigation was dismissed by the Court on February 25, 2020.

Seasonality
We do not anticipate that our business will be affected by seasonal factors.
Impact of Inflation
While we are subject to general inflationary trends, including for basic manufacturing production materials, our management believes that inflation in and of itself does not have a material effect on our operating results. However, inflation may become a factor in the future. However, the COVID-19 virus and its current extraordinary impact on the world economy has reduced oil consumption globally, decreasing crude oil prices, to levels not seen since the early 1980’s. The economics of GTL conversion rely in part on the arbitrage between oil and natural gas prices, with economic models for many producers, including our own models, using a range of $30-60/bbl (for WTI or Brent Crude as listed daily on the Nymex and ICE commodities exchanges) to determine relative profitability of their GTL operations. While the COVID-19 virus may run its human course in the near term, we believe (as many others in the U.S. government and media believe), that the economic impacts will be long lasting and for all practical matters, remain largely unknown at this time.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
During the year ended December 2019, we entered into a revenue interest research and development venture with Mabert and an employee, Tom Phillips, OPMGE. However, based on events of default in their agreement with the Company, Mabert no longer has any formal arrangements with OPMGE or Tom Phillips. Since inception of this arrangement, we have advanced a total of $412,885 to OPMGE. Given the uncertainty of the collectability of this receivable, the Company has fully reserved for this amount as of December 31, 2021.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our Financial Statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Preparing our Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and impairment of long-lived assets.
We evaluate our long-lived assets for financial impairment on a regular basis in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” which evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets not held for sale by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the estimated discounted future cash flows associated with them. At the time such evaluations indicate that the future discounted cash flows of certain long-lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets, the assets are adjusted to their fair values.
We believe that the critical accounting policies discussed below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as guidance on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers in May 2014 with amendments in 2015 and 2016. Revenue recognition will depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method). We adopted the guidance on January 1, 2018 and applied the cumulative catch-up transition method. The transition adjustment to be recorded to stockholders’ deficit upon adoption of the new standard did not have a material effect upon the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not, to date, generated any revenues.
Equity Method Investment
On August 29, 2019, we entered into a research and development venture, OPMGE, with Mabert and an employee, Tom Phillips. We contributed a limited license to use our proprietary and patented GTL technology and a working G-Reformer refractory unit, for no actual cost basis, in exchange for 300 membership units in OPMGE, equating to an approximately a 42.857% current interest in OPMGE, pending the expected issuance of an additional 300 membership units, equating to a net 30% ownership interest in OPMGE at that time. OPMGE is no longer operating and no longer a viable entity. There was not previously and is no book or asset value attributed to the contributed technology. Any advances made to OPMGE have been fully reserved for by the Company due to the lack of collectability.
Stock-Based Compensation
Accounting Standard 718, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“ASC 718”) established financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based employee compensation plans. It defines a fair value-based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument. In January 2006, we implemented ASC 718, and accordingly, we account for compensation cost for stock option plans in accordance with ASC 718.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of our Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our Financial Statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of 3-months or less to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents at December 31, 2021, or December 31, 2020. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to “dollars” in this Form 10-K are to U.S. dollars.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires that we recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax benefit (expense) results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will not be realized.
We have adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 740-10-05, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (“ASC 750-10-05”). ASC 750-10-05 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Additionally, ASC 750-10-05 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Open tax years, subject to IRS examination include 2016 - 2020.
Net Loss per Share, Basic and Diluted
We have adopted Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 260-10, Earnings per Share, specifying the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements of earning per share information. Basic loss per share has been computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares issued and outstanding for the period. Shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants (3,000,000), shares convertible for debt (2,083,333) and shares outstanding but not yet issued (365,166) have been excluded as a common stock equivalent in the diluted loss per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive as of December 31, 2021. Shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants (7,000,000), shares of Common Stock convertible for debt (2,083,333) and shares of Common Stock outstanding but not yet issued (537,762) have been excluded as a common stock equivalent in the diluted loss per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive as of December 31, 2020.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”), which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. ASC 815 requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value.
If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge, the objective of which is to match the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging derivative with the recognition of (i) the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk or (ii) the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction. For a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument, the gain or loss is recognized in income in the period of change.
Concentration and Credit Risk
Financial instruments and related items, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, and trade receivables. We place our cash and temporary cash investments with high -credit quality institutions. At times, such investments may be in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Subsequent Events
From January 1, 2022 through the period ended April 8, 2022, the Company issued 2,565,166 shares of common stock comprised of: 2,366,666 shares of Rule 144 restricted Common Stock issued in a private placement to four accredited investors at an average price of $0.02 per share and 198,500 shares issued to Kevin Jones, a related party, for costs related to issuance of promissory notes.
