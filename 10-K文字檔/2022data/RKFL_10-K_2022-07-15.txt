Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation
Overview
Our Business
We (or the “Company”) provide cryptocurrency and other check-out and payment systems that securely automate and simplify the way online payment and shipping information is received by merchants from their customers. Our “one click” checkout solution is modeled on the “buy now” button on leading eCommerce sites. Our check-out systems are designed to enhance customers’ data protection, enabling consumers to pay for goods and services using cryptocurrencies or by direct transfers from their bank accounts without exposing spending credentials such as credit card data. At the same time, our check-out systems are designed to increase the speed, security and ease of use for both customers and merchants and include a merchant portal that provides detailed transactions and metrics about payments received by the merchant. Our system also includes a customer portal where shoppers are able to track their payments, configure payment defaults and connect with various cryptocurrency exchanges and banks to facilitate payment to merchants. Merchants are able to integrate a unique pop-up user interface that allows customers to pay directly from their eCommerce checkout page with no need to redirect to another website or web page.
Our corporate headquarters are located in San Francisco, California.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to our financial statements. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by our management, and such judgments are reflected in the amounts reported in our financial statements. In applying these policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of estimates. Those estimates are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of market trends, information provided by our strategic partners and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Actual results may differ significantly from the estimates contained in our financial statements.
Results of Operations
Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2022 vs. March 31, 2021
Revenues
During March 2021, we commenced commercial operations and executed several contracts with customers. In accordance with the terms of the contracts, we received the payment in connection with the implementation of our remittance technologies. We record the implementation fees as deferred revenue which is amortized ratably over the contract term. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, we generated $30,504 primarily from the recognized implementation fees. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we did not generate any revenue. We anticipate that future revenues will be generated from (i) fees charged in connection with the implementation of our remittance technologies; and (ii) ongoing daily transactional fees derived as a negotiated percentage of the transactional revenues earned by our merchant customers.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 were $897,277 as compared to $163,405 for the comparable prior year period, an increase of $733,872. The increase is due primarily to hiring of contractors in India and applying additional resources in connection with continued development of our technology for payment processing. Costs associated with adding new features to our software platform are capitalized and amortized over a 2-year expected life.

Our financial statements have been presented on the basis that we are a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, we reported a net loss of $4,662,924, which included non-cash stock-based compensation of $1,380,642, and cash flows used in operating activities of $2,776,911. As a result, management believes that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
We will require additional financing in order to continue to develop our product and execute on our business plan. However, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in raising the additional capital necessary to continue operations and execute on our business plan. Any potential future sale of equity or debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders, and we cannot be certain that additional public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are required to raise additional financing, but are unable to obtain such financing, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more aspects of our operations or business development activities.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of March 31, 2022, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
